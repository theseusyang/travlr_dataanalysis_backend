<b>Buenos Aires</b> (the official name 'is <i>Ciudad AutÃ³noma de Buenos Aires</i>/<i>Autonomous City of Buenos Aires</i>, also called <i>Capital Federal</i>/<i>Federal Capital</i>) is the capital of the <a href="/en/Argentina" title="Argentina">Argentine Republic</a>. The name means <i>fair winds</i>, or literally <i>good air</i> in Spanish. It is one of the largest cities in <a href="/en/Latin_America" title="Latin America">Latin America</a>, with a lot of cultural offerings, and is the point of departure for travelling to the rest of the country. Inhabitants of Buenos Aires are called <i>porteÃ±os</i>, "people from the port", implying that many of the inhabitants are immigrants in some ways or another. Buenos Aires is a singular, open, and integrating destination that allows the visitor not only to view the city but also to have an exceptional urban adventure.
The city is geographically contained inside the province of <a href="/en/Buenos_Aires_(province)" title="Buenos Aires (province)">Buenos Aires</a>, but it is politically autonomous . Its coordinates are 34Âº 36' S, 58Âº 26' W.
The city extends on a plain covering 19.4 km (12 mi) from north to south and 17.9 km (11 mi) from east to west.
Approximately three million people live in the City of <strong class="selflink">Buenos Aires</strong> (the Federal Capital of Argentina with 202 kmÂ² [78.3 miÂ²]). The City is divided into 48 districts or <i>barrios</i> (<i>neighborhoods</i>). Its metropolitan area, Great Buenos Aires (<i>Gran Buenos Aires</i>), is one of the ten most populated urban centers in the world with over 15 million people. Most of the country's activity is highly concentrated in this single city and its surroundings.
Buenos Aires constantly receives tourists from all over the world and offers a large choice of cultural events, nightlife, restaurants, and pubs. So you can expect good services and a wide range of options.
Buenos Aires also has one of the largest homosexual communities in Latin America and there is a receptive attitude towards gay society in the federal law, same sex marriages are legally performed and recognized in Argentinian federal law. In recent years there has been an increase in gay oriented businesses such as real estate, apartment rental, travel agents, language classes, tango classes, bars, restaurants, hotels, and guesthouses. Since 2007, the city has seen the arrival of more gay cruise ships, the opening of a gay five-star hotel and a general increase in gay tourism.
The City of Buenos Aires has 48 districts called <i>barrios</i> (<i>neighborhoods</i>). The most important and visited are:
Travellers from many countries, including <b>all EU/EEA citizens</b>, as well as (amongst others) citizens of New Zealand and Japan, may enter Argentina for up to <b>90 days</b> without a visa.
Citizens from <b>Australia, Canada and the United States</b> must register prior to travel at <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.migraciones.gov.ar/accesible/templates/reciprocidad/reciprocidad.htm">http://www.migraciones.gov.ar/accesible/templates/reciprocidad/reciprocidad.htm</a> and must pay a "reciprocity fee". Since December 2012 this also applies for arrivals overland. The fees/validity periods are as follows:
Buenos Aires is Argentinaâs international gateway and easily accessible from North America, Europe, and Australasia, as well as other capital cities in South America.
The main airport used for international flights to travel to and from Buenos Aires is <b>Ezeiza International Airport</b>, about 35&#160;km (20&#160;mi) south of Buenos Aires. Most domestic flights, as well as many flights to and from neighboring countries (Uruguay, Brazil, Chile and Paraguay) use the smaller but more convenient <b>Aeroparque Jorge Newbery</b> airport, a short distance from downtown Buenos Aires. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.aa2000.com.ar/">Flight information for both Ezeiza International Airport  and Aeroparque Jorge Newbery</a>, is available in English and Spanish at 5480-6111. Buenos Aires also has a lot of small airports dedicated to chartered flights and private aircraft.
Flights from Buenos Aires and the rest of Argentina are usually more expensive for foreigners. This can pose a problem for short-term travellers who do not have time to take a bus to places like Iguazu Falls, Bariloche, Ushuaia, etc.  These travellers are often advised to find smaller travel companies/agents that can help them find lower prices on lower flights, deals that larger online travel sites would not have access to.
Ezeiza is a modern airport with good services such as ATMs, restaurants, and duty-free shops.
Most international and some domestic flights use the Ezeiza International Airport (officially referred to as <i>Aeropuerto Internacional Ministro Pistarini</i> / <i>Minister Pistarini International Airport</i>), located in the suburban area named <i>Gran Buenos Aires</i>, c. 30-45&#160;min from downtown by highway (can be much longer in rush hours). Planes fly from and to most countries in South America, Europe, North America and Oceania.
Some flights from <i>AerolÃ­neas Argentinas</i> to <a href="/en/R%C3%ADo_Gallegos" title="RÃ­o Gallegos" class="mw-redirect">RÃ­o Gallegos</a> and <a href="/en/Ushuaia" title="Ushuaia">Ushuaia</a> leave from Ezeiza during peak season, so check to see on which airport you fly into or leave from. There is a daily flight from Ezeiza to Mendoza and CÃ³rdoba, which connects with most AerolÃ­neas Argentinas International Arrivals and Departures.
There are flights from Ezeiza to most South American cities like: <a href="/en/Caracas" title="Caracas">Caracas</a>, <a href="/en/Bogot%C3%A1" title="BogotÃ¡">BogotÃ¡</a>, <a href="/en/Lima" title="Lima">Lima</a>, <a href="/en/Santa_Cruz_de_la_Sierra" title="Santa Cruz de la Sierra" class="mw-redirect">Santa Cruz de la Sierra</a>, <a href="/en/Cochabamba" title="Cochabamba">Cochabamba</a>, <a href="/en/Santiago_de_Chile" title="Santiago de Chile">Santiago de Chile</a>, a dozen of <a href="/en/Brazil" title="Brazil">Brazilian</a> destinations, <a href="/en/Montevideo" title="Montevideo">Montevideo</a>, and <a href="/en/Asunci%C3%B3n" title="AsunciÃ³n">AsunciÃ³n</a>. However, many flights to/from neighboring countries (Uruguay, Brazil, Chile and Paraguay) now use the smaller but more convenient Buenos Aires City Airport-<b>Aeroparque Jorge Newbery</b> (AEP), very close to downtown (see below). Service from Montevideo, in particular, is almost exclusively to Aeroparque, with only one daily flight to Ezeiza as of October 2012, contrasting with several throughout the day to Aeroparque.

Connecting flights with LAN from Santiago are available to get to Buenos Aires when coming from Australia to Argentina.
<i>AerolÃ­neas Argentinas</i> still flies from Ezeiza to <a href="/en/Sydney" title="Sydney">Sydney</a>.
From the airport, there are taxis, private cars (<i>remises</i>), buses, and minibuses.
There is also a railway station near Ezeiza International Airport named Ezeiza Station. Unfortunately, due the location of Ezeiza International Airport's main entrance and exit, getting to and from the station itself would at least take around a third of the trip between Ezeiza International Airport and Buenos Aires itself. It is not advisable to go there if your final destination is central Buenos Aires.
Trips on coaches such as <i>Manuel Tienda LeÃ³n</i> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.tiendaleon.com.ar">[1]</a> from Ezeiza International Airport to Retiro cost 80 pesos. The coaches leave every half hour--less frequently during evenings. From their terminal in Retiro (corner of San Martin and Av. Madero), a smaller van will deliver you to any downtown address for an additional 15 pesos. Manuel Tienda LeÃ³n also offers transfers between Ezeiza International Airport  and Aeroparque Jorge Newbery Airport. Tickets can be purchased from their booth just outside of customs.  If you miss it in customs (European, Australian, and U.S. travellers are probably more used to such services being located not inside customs), then walk outside. Keep walking for about 200 meters heading towards Terminal B, turn left, go to Terminal B departures, and there's an outside booth there.
Ensure you go to the 'Manuel Tienda LeÃ³n' desk for the coach (the first desk on your right as you leave the Customs screening area but before you exit into the main arrivals hall). People at other desks would happily say there's no coach to your hotel and will try to persuade you to take a taxi. Alternatively, follow instructions above and go to Terminal B for the coach. If the coach does not go to your hotel (i.e. if it is outside their coverage area), they will tell you where they could drop you off near-by.
Private driving services to and from the airport are more expensive but more personalised. Some offer English speaking drivers. SilverStar Transport is an excellent option. They have English-speaking drivers and can be booked online. <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://silverstarcar.com/index">[2]</a>
Prepaid taxis (remises) from Ezeiza International Airport to downtown cost at least 250 pesos plus additional costs (mainly tolls). They are your simplest and safest transport from the airport. As you exit customs there are booths on either side of the receiving area of the airport. Some of the prepaid remises will provide you with a 20% discount coupon for your airport return. If you manage to hold on to this coupon, dial them directly to come and collect you and save yourself 20%. You must also present the original receipt to receive the discount.
There are other established companies, such as Manuel Tienda LeÃ³n and Go Airport Taxi Buenos Aires, which allow for a pre-reservation online in order to guarantee your car/driver prior to your arrival. This may be essential in the morning hours, when the bulk of the long-haul flights arrive to the airport.
Hailing a curbside taxi is not recommended for tourists that are only newly acquainted wth Buenos Aires, but if one does, one should select a taxi that is dropping someone off. It will cost approximately 30% less than a remis. The cab driver will tell you a fixed price beforehand, if not, you should negotiate the price before leaving the pickup area. You should have some familiarity with Buenos Aires and speak Spanish fairly well, as you cab driver will likely not speak English.
The cheapest way to get downtown is to take the number 8 bus. The stop is just outside terminal B arrivals, and you need to walk 100 m. The bus will take almost 2 h to get to the Plaza de Mayo, going straight on Rivadavia Avenue and then on Hipolito Yrigoyen street. It will cost 4 pesos to get downtown. Be ready to have coins to use them on the bus: you can get change at the counters where the airport tax is paid or at any airport shop. This is <i>not</i> advised for someone unfamiliar with the city. Be mindful of your surroundings and avoid the common scam mentioned in <a href="/en/Buenos_Aires#Stay_safe" title="Buenos Aires">Stay safe</a>.
If you are returning to Ezeiza International Airport  from downtown, be sure to ride the 8 bus that says <i>AEROPUERTO</i> (<i>AIRPORT</i>) as there are several 8 buses that go to other places. The bus stops all along Mayo Avenue and then Rivadavia Avenue. It can take more than two hours to get to the airport from downtown (longer than the trip in from the airport), and the bus can get extremely crowded. If you are pressed for time or short on patience, it is highly recommended that you skip this bus and take a taxi or remise.
Alternatively, you could catch a coach from the 'Manuel Tienda LeÃ³n' coach station in Retiro (near Sheraton), Ramos Mejia &amp; Av. Del Libertador (and not the main Omnibus station). The cost to EZE would be AR$ 80. If you would like them to collect you from your hotel(assuming it's within the area they cover - mostly central Buenos Aires), you have to call 'Manuel Tienda LeÃ³n' on 0810-888-LEON (5366) the day before. They will collect and take you to the above coach station and then on to EZE. The cost is AR$ 15 (for local collection) and AR$ 80 to the airport. Unfortunately, you have to call them on the above number to book a collection! Total journey time is likely to be 20 mins (local), up to 15 min wait for the main coach and then about 45 mins.
Located in the Ave. Rafael Obligado. +54 11 4576-5300 extension 107/122 (Information: +54 11 4576-1111), very close to Retiro Omnibus and San Martin railway stations. Nearly all domestic flights and from/to Uruguay, as well as many flights from Brazil, Chile and Paraguay, use <b>Jorge Newbery Airport</b> (referred to as <b>Aeroparque</b>, the Spanish for <i>Airpark</i>/<i>Airfield</i>). Aeroparque is smaller and less modern than Ezeiza, but it is also much more convenient, as it is only 20 minutes away from the downtown area by car. You can take a taxi (25 pesos) or bus from there.
People at the travel desks at AEP would tell you that taxi into town costs AR$102! (This appears to be high; could someone confirm fare, please? May be cheaper to hail a cab from outside). 'Manuel Tienda LeÃ³n' provide a service into town and then possibly to your hotel. You could access their desk either from the Baggage Collection area or from the main hallway outside. Buses leave every hour between 0800 and 0030. The coach would take you to their central depot in Retiro and then on a local coach to your hotel. The cost is AR$45 for both the main coach into Retiro and the local shuttle. Note that the main coach then continues onto EZE so ensure you get off at the central depot in Retiro (about 2o mins from airport).
Public bus, nos 33 &amp; 45 also go from outside AEP to Retiro. The ticket machine will not accept notes so you will have to have AR$4 worth of coins on you before you get on the bus.
You could use 'Manuel Tienda LeÃ³n'. See 'returning to airport' note under EZE above.
Alternatively, you could catch bus numbers 33 and 45 from outside Retiro Omnibus station. However, finding the right bus stop is not easy! Imagine you are coming out of the Omnibus station. The buses arriving immediately outside go from your left to right. You need 33 or 45 going in the opposite direction; i.e. from your right to left. So, cross the street and when you reach onto the pavement by the park, go to the last bus stop on your left. You should be almost opposite the Retiro Omnibus station now. The fare is AR$4 but the ticket machine on the bus will only accept coins so ensure you have sufficient change for the ticket.
There are national railways, but they are very few in numbers. There are some long distance domestic services. Buses are usually faster and more comfortable, but also three times as expensive. There are several main stations in the Buenos Aires area (see below).
Retiro - CÃ³rdoba (overnight): departs Mon. &amp; Fri. 20:10, arrives 10:25
CÃ³rdoba - Retiro (overnight): departs Thu. &amp; Sun. 16:30, 07:33 (25 pesos - tourist class)
Retiro - TucumÃ¡n (overnight): departs Mon. 10:05, arrives 10:40
TucumÃ¡n - Retiro (overnight): departs Wed. 18:00, arrives 19:20 (35 pesos - tourist class)
Federico Lacrosse - Posadas&#160;: departs Tue 10.50 and Fri at 20:00, with 54 stops and taking at <i>least</i> 30 hours.
You can get to Buenos Aires from any of the neighboring countries by car, but it is far away from most of the borders. It is really common to travel there only from <a href="/en/Uruguay" title="Uruguay">Uruguay</a> and southern <a href="/en/Brazil" title="Brazil">Brazil</a>.
There are four main highways entering the city which connect to suburban areas and other national routes. As with the trains, the bigger and more frequented routes are centered in Buenos Aires, so you will have no problem driving to and from the rest of the country.
Heading to <a href="/en/Rosario" title="Rosario">Rosario</a> city, you can travel by highway all the way (north access highway, then route 9). From here you can keep heading north on a good route (<i>Panamericana</i>), or turn right about 150km from Buenos Aires and go to the <a href="/en/Mesopotamia_(Argentina)" title="Mesopotamia (Argentina)">Mesopotamia</a> region.
To the west, you can drive to the <a href="/en/Cuyo" title="Cuyo">Cuyo</a> region using the north access highway, then route 8. Traveling out of the city on the west access highway, you can follow routes 7 and 5, which will lead you to the west and southwest, respectively. If you want to visit western <a href="/en/Patagonia_(Argentina)" title="Patagonia (Argentina)">Patagonia</a>, route 5 is a good choice.
Finally for visiting the Atlantic shore of <a href="/en/Buenos_Aires_(province)" title="Buenos Aires (province)">Buenos Aires (province)</a>, you need to head to the southeast access highway and then take route 2, a very good highway to <a href="/en/Mar_del_Plata" title="Mar del Plata">Mar del Plata</a> city.
As a tourist is is possible to rent a car while in Buenos Aires, in the zones of Centro, Retiro, Versalles,Nunez, and Ezeiza.
There are very good services departing from Retiro bus station <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.tebasa.com.ar/">[3]</a>, covering the whole country. Generally speaking the more expensive the ticket, the more comfortable the bus will be. The most expensive tickets will get you seats that fully recline and you will also be served meals and drinks by an attendant on board.
Almost all the long-distance buses use the huge and well-organised Retiro bus station on the northern edge of the city centre. The buses are mostly relatively new, however the roads they will travel through are relatively old; there are frequent services to most parts of the country and international bus services to neighbouring countries. A second bus terminal is situated in the Liniers neighborhood, but it is much smaller and not connected to the subway.
You may catch taxis from Retiro bus station, and the <i>subte</i> (underground) also stops there. There are many local buses that stop outside the station as well.
There are numerous operators. The basement level is for cargo and package services. The ground level holds waiting areas, cafes, shops and services including a barber. On the upper level you find a large number (close to 200) of ticket offices, or boleterias. The upper level is conveniently divided by color into geographic areas for companies which serve the place you want to go, including an international area. Look for the signs.
Cama Suites or Dormi Camas lie completely flat and some have dividing curtains. With these services, the seating arrangement is one seat one side and two seats on the other side. Semi-Cama services are laid out two and two, and do not recline as far. Companies usually have photographs of bus interiors. Make sure the journey you choose has the service you want. Most of their buses are double decker.
Bus travel times to/from Buenos Aires:
Terminal de Omnibus de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires
You can buy a ticket to practically anywhere in Argentina and departures are fairly frequent to the most popular destinations. Reservations are not necessary except during peak summer and winter holiday seasons (January, February, and July).
To find out which companies are available for a specific destination you can consult the official webpage of the terminal Retiro <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.tebasa.com.ar">[4]</a> and an online information system for buses from Buenos Aires <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.omnilineas.com">[5]</a> to the main national and international destinations.
There are daily journeys to and from <a href="/en/Colonia" title="Colonia">Colonia</a> and <a href="/en/Montevideo" title="Montevideo">Montevideo</a> in <a href="/en/Uruguay" title="Uruguay">Uruguay</a>.
Three companies operate this service.
The services are now coordinated by Buquebus.  The ferry tour ship is the slower one, used for Colonia. You may still make a fast trip to Colonia, at a higher price. Certain boats are nicer than others, but for about 36 pesos ($10) you can upgrade to first class both ways, which includes VIP lounge access and a free glass of champagne. Highly recommended on the nicer boats (you can upgrade on board).
From the official city site:
The City is an important destination for the maritime and fluvial cruisers industry of South America. The Benito Quinquela MartÃ­n Passenger Terminal, a few blocks away from downtown, at RamÃ³n Castillo street between Avenida de los Inmigrantes and Mayor Luisioni street, has a surface of 7,100 square meters, a boarding room for 1,000 passengers and baggage facilities with capacity for 2,500 suitcases. Additional features include tourist information, handicrafts shops, snack bars as well as the offices for Migration, Customs, Interpol and Prefectura (Coast Guard).
You may also take a boat from nearby Tigre to Nueva Palmira in Uruguay.  Trains leave from Retiro Station to Tigre frequently.  Boat services to Nueva Palmira also connect to Colonia del Sacramento by bus. As always, be careful of leaving your belongings at a station
There is also a service from Montevideo-Carmelo-Tigre-Buenos Aires <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.cacciolaviajes.com">[8]</a>. It costs around 36 pesos($10) one way for the whole thing. Get the tickets and depart from Tres Cruces in Montevideo. The price includes a bus to Carmelo, boat to Tigre, and another bus to the center of Buenos Aires. They often have very good special offers that include some nights in hotels in Buenos Aires.
<b>Grimaldi Lines - Freighter Travel</b> operates a bi-monthly freighter link from Europe to South-America via Africa. Five freighter ships do the rotation and each accepts 12 passengers. The journey lasts about 30 days (60 days for a round trip) and port calls include: Hamburg, Tillbury, Antwerp, Le Havre, Bilbao, Casablanca, Dakar, Banjul, Conakry, Freetown, Salvador de Bahia, Vitoria, Rio de Janeiro, Santos Zarate, Buenos Aires, Montevideo, Paranagua, Santos, Rio de Janeiro, Dakar, Emden, and back to Hamburg. Only the stops in Europe and at Buenos Aires permit passengers to either embark or disembark. However, passengers are allowed to visit all of the visited ports. All the port calls are subject to change depending on the loading and unloading needs of the ship. Tickets for a cabin on a Europe to Buenos AAires trip start at â¬1450/pp for a double cabin and â¬1890 for a single cabin (more expensive luxury cabins are available).
The <b>public transport</b> in Buenos Aires is very good, although crowded during rush hour. The metro (or underground railway) here is called the "Subte", which is short for <i>Subterraneo</i> (<i>underground</i>). The network itself is not very large, but reaches most tourist attractions of the city, and there is a large range of bus routes and several suburban railways used by commuters.
There are electronic resources to find bus routes&#160;: ComoViajo <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.comoviajo.com">(website)</a>, miTinerario (<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://itunes.apple.com/ar/app/mitinerario-buenos-aires-bus/id385675756?mt=8">iPhone App</a>).
<b>Finding your way around</b> is relatively easy. Most of the city grid is divided into equal squares with block numbers in the hundreds, using a grid system similiar to <a href="/en/Manhattan" title="Manhattan"> Manhattan, New York</a>. Most streets are one way with the adjacent parallels going the other way, so beware that the bus or taxi won't follow the same route back. If traveling by taxi, you simply need to tell the driver the street and block number, eg. "Santa Fe 2100"; or two intersecting streets, eg. "Corrientes y Callao".
<b>City maps</b> are issued by many different publishers (<i>GuÃ­a T, LUMI</i>) and the local tourist authority. They are indispensable for those wanting to use public transportation, since they include all bus routes. As always, check ton which direction the map is pointing, because some maps are <i>bottom up</i> (South on the top of the map). This is true for the maps at the official taxi booth at Ezeiza airport.
Walking is a great way to get around Buenos Aires during the day. With the grid system it is relatively easy to get around and because of the traffic it may even be quicker than a taxi or bus. The larger avenidas are lined with shops so there is plenty so see. In the Micro centro calle Florida is a pedestrian shopping street where you can walk from Plaza San Martin to Avenida de Mayo near the Plaza de Mayo. It crosses Lavalle (also pedestrian only) which takes you to the Plaza de la Republica and the Obelisk.
Taxis are not the quickest way to move around the more congested parts of the city, especially during rush hour, as traffic jams are common. Still, you will find that taxis are usually rather inexpensive, convenient, and exciting (in a white-knuckled, classic-wooden-roller-coaster kind of way). Make sure to take the "radio taxi", as some taxis do no turn on the meter and will ask for a very expensive fare.
It's relatively quite safe to travel by taxis. For details refer to <a href="#Stay_safe">Stay safe</a>. If you are uncomfortable hailing a taxi on the street you can have your hotel or restaurant call a taxi for you. You should always check the driverÂ´s personal information is legible in the back part of the front seat, and make sure they turn on the meter after they set off, to avoid any disagreeement over the fare later. It is suggested to use small bills and exact or almost exact changes with taxis, since as with many large cities around the world, it sometimes can be quite problematic of getting changes back from a taxi driver.
The principal means of public transportation within the city are the buses (<i>colectivos</i>). All rides inside the city border are fixed at a cheap maximum fixed price (1.70 pesos), as long as you are moving inside the city borders. Tickets must be bought on the bus through a machine that accepts coins only.
There is a prepaid RFID proximity card named SUBE, that works with every city bus or metro. It is similiar to Suica, Octopus, Oyster, EZ-link, and so on in other countries.
There are more than one hundred lines covering the whole city. They work 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, but run less frequently on holidays and late at night. For each route the bus is painted differently making them easy to distinguish. The best way to figure out the bus system is to buy a GuÃ­a "T". It's essentially a little book with a directory of streets, which corresponds to map pages, and has bus listings on the facing page for each map. Once you get your hands on one, it's very easy to figure out, but give yourself fifteen minutes the first few times you use it to plan a route. These can be bought at many kiosks around the city, or subway stations.
If you have access to an internet-connection you can also use the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://mapa.buenosaires.gov.ar/">website</a> provided by the city government. Here you enter your address and your destination and it will show you several alternatives by bus or subte.
Otherwise, visitors who are comfortable with speaking a little Spanish can call 131, a toll-free free telephone number from any phone, to help you find which <i>colectivo</i> to take. You just have to tell the corner (or the street and the number) where you're at and the one you want to get to.
On most services, board the bus and tell the driver your destination&#160;; he will press a button instructing the coin machine to take a certain amount of money for you, which will then appear on the machine as the amount to insert. Step a bit further back into the bus and insert coins into the machine which now knows your destination and has calculated your fare because the driver punched it in. You will receive change and your ticket automatically, collect it at the bottom of the machine.
If you do not have a SUBE card (which you cannot get unless you have a D.N.I.) you will now be charged 3 pesos minimum within Capital Federal. The old MONEDERO card that tourists could use has been deactivated.
If you're using the SUBE proximity card, just show your card to the the driver, and also say the ticket price or your destination. Just wait for the driver to selects your destination on his panel, you will notice the amount to be payed on the display of the yellow reader with the SUBE label next to him. You can then use the card against it and the payment will be processed, and the balance of the card will be shown. Please note that no actual ticket will  given to you when paying by SUBE card. DO NOT use the card before the driver selects your destination, since he may still be in the processing of processing your order and say "NO, TODAVIA" ("No, I'm still selecting the destination", or "NOT YET!").
If you see a little metal knob on the coin machine, it's not for dispensing your ticket like the candy/toy machines in grocery stores. It's the service panel to the inside of the machine to change the paper and so on. Don't turn it! It's meant to be used for service only.
You can also use buses to move in and around the suburban area (<i>Gran Buenos Aires</i>), but the fares are higher (up to 5,50 Pesos, depending on the distance and service). The suburban-only lines (you can differentiate them because their line numbers are above 200) have less comfort, and many of them don't run after 11PM.
Commuter trains connect Buenos Airesâ center to its suburbs and nearby provinces. They are mostly catered for local commuters and not tourists. The terminal stations are the same from suburban transportation. From Retiro station you can take the train to the Tigre Delta. There you can do a boat cruise and see the wetland and recreational area of the porteÃ±os.
The city has a subway network ("subte", short form of "tren subterrÃ¡neo", which means "underground train"). It is very efficient and you can save a lot of time by using it. It is cheap (2.50 pesos for unlimited transfer as long as you keep underground travelling throughout the network). If you need to be somewhere by 9AM or 9.30AM on a weekday, however, the Subte will be incredibly crowded and depending on where you are catching it from, you may have to miss several trains in a row before there is space for you. Once on board, during peak hours it can get very crowded. Factor this into your timing arrangements to make sure that you make your meeting on time.
The <i>subte</i> runs approximately from 5AM to 10PM, except on Sundays, when service starts at 8AM.
Many <i>subte</i> stations have interesting murals, tiles and artwork. The "Peru" station is the oldest subway station. Transferring between lines is indicated by <i>combinaciÃ³n</i> signs.
You can buy reusable tickets and add credit on them which can be used for several trips saving you from having to always go to the cashier to purchase individual tickets. Tickets are not swiped or taken away upon exiting stations, therefore you may use one magnetic stripe ticket for more than one traveler, as long as it has the required number of fares.
The current network comprises six underground lines, labelled "A" to "E" and "H" which all converge to the downtown area and connect to the main bus and train terminals.
In the southeast branch (the E line), the service is extended by a trainway known as <i>premetro</i>, but beware, it goes to some of the least desireable places in the city. Premetro is 0.60 pesos, or 0.70 with a Subte Transfer.
The <i>subte</i> and <i>premetro</i> services are under Metrovias S.A. authority.  You can reach their Customer Service personnel by calling -toll free (within Argentina)- on 0800-555-1616 or by sending a fax to +54 4553-9270.

The main railway terminals are <i>Retiro</i>, <i>ConstituciÃ³n</i>, <i>Once</i> and <i>Federico Lacroze</i>. From all of these you can then use the metro and bus network to get right into the center. The suburban fares are very cheap.
More information:
If departing from Retiro station, it's a good idea for a whole day journey (specially in summer where daylight lasts much more) to buy a one way ticket at Mitre station, stop for a small walk at some of the stations and arrive to Tigre where you can find lots of attractions, and in then go back to Retiro using the Tigre branch of the Mitre line.
If you are truly adventurous (and a bit of a risk-taker), cars are available to rent in Buenos Aires. There are several things to keep in mind before renting a car in Buenos Aires. First, Buenos Aires is such an excellent city for walking that if something is within 20 or 30 blocks, it is often worth the extra effort to go on foot and get to know the city on a more intimate level. The terrain is flat, so it's can be easily walked on. Second, if you aren't much of a walker, the public transportation system in Buenos Aires is cheap and efficient. It can get you anywhere fast!  Third, and perhaps most important, the traffic in Buenos Aires is extremely unpredictable. Stoplights, signs, traffic laws--for many porteÃ±o drivers, are mere <i>references</i>. Picture yourself trying to get several thousand heads of cattle to move down the street and stay inside the lanes, and you have a decent idea of driving in Buenos Aires. It's also very difficult to find where to park your car in many neighborhoods, and close to impossible in downtown. Do NOT leave your car parked where you're not supposed to because it will be towed away, and the recovery fee is VERY EXPENSIVE. Many hidden speed control cameras have been installed lately (specially in avenues), so be sure to stick to the speed limit, even in routes outside the city. DO fasten your seat belt and have your lights turned on or you will be fined.
If driving outside the city, you should not only stick to the speed limit (which varies a lot depending on where you are), but have your identification and driving license with you, as it's possible that you get stopped by traffic control policemen. National routes are in a good state of manteinance, but be careful in province only routes as there may be unexpected and dangerous potholes in the pavement.
There is also the option to do private car tours. One (fun) option is to go for Buenos Aires Vintage Tours, which offers original CitroÃ«n 3CVs to do the tour. Check <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://http://www.buenosaires-vintage.com.ar/">Buenos Aires Vintage</a> for details on available tours.
Buenos Aires is not the most suitable city for cycling. Traffic is dangerous and hardly respectful toward bicycles; the biggest vehicle wins the right of way, and bikes are low on the totem pole. Still, some spots call out for two-wheeled exploration, such as Palermoâs parks and the Reserva EcolÃ³gica Costanera Sur; on weekends and some weekdays you can rent bikes at these places. It can be a very hectic experience, but by no means impossible if you have ridden a bike in traffic before. Here's some tips:
However recently a bicycling network has been developed and it's constantly expanding. Check the web site for the updated map: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://mejorenbici.buenosaires.gob.ar/">http://mejorenbici.buenosaires.gob.ar/</a>
The Spanish in Buenos Aires is pronounced differently from elsewhere. "Calle" and "pollo" sound very different and the <i>ll</i> sound like English <i>sh</i> instead of Spanish <i>y</i> or <i>h</i>. The difference in pronunciation probably reflects the influence of Italian traders in the port in the 19th century--many of the words that PorteÃ±os pronounce differently from the rest of the Spanish-speaking world are pronounced identically to a Italian word for the same thing.
Much has been written on Spanish language in Buenos Aires. It was influenced by the many nationalities that immigrated here as well.
If you have studied Spanish, you will find these differences enormous. Also, vocabulary and some pronouns differ a lot from Iberian Spanish or other Latin American varieties of Spanish, so may be useful to get an Argentinian dictionary or take some lessons of Argentinian Spanish before getting there. Despite these differences, any person who is fluent in Spanish should have no difficulty navigating through conversations with PorteÃ±os or with any other Argentinians, although sometimes they tend to speak <i>very</i> fast and you may have to ask <i>"hable despacio, por favor"</i> ("speak slowly, please"). Anyway, most of "PorteÃ±os" (inhabitants of Buenos Aires City) speak <i>a little</i> English but it is very easy to find people who are very fluent, especially if you stay near the tourist areas.
Buenos Aires is a big city, so check the <a href="/en/Buenos_aires#Districts" title="Buenos aires" class="mw-redirect">districts</a> section for detailed listings.
If you are a fan of walking in green open spaces and parks in big cities like Buenos Aires, be sure not to miss a promenade in Palermo, a beautiful area in the northern part of the city. Here you will find not only open spaces to walk in but also a large lake where you can rent paddle boats and an huge flower garden that is free to enter! Although the Japanese and the botanical gardens and the surroundings are very nice, they are also very noisy as several major roads traverse the area. For a quiet, shady walk or jog head to the golf course north of the railway tracks.
Another great place to walk along and experience <a href="/en/Argentina" title="Argentina">Argentine</a> street life is <i>El Puerto de Buenos Aires</i>. Its personality however is quite contrasting during the day and during the night.
<a href="/en/Buenos_Aires/La_Boca" title="Buenos Aires/La Boca">La Boca</a> has the <i>Caminito</i> pedestrian street with arts and crafts. There is also a river cruise you can take from there where you can see a huge picturesque metal structure across the river. You can try and catch a rowboat to Avellaneda on the other side of the water for 0.50 pesos, but you will have to try your luck as the rower may not allow you on citing that its dangerous. La Boca is famous for Tango and you can often catch glimpses of Tango dancers practicing in the streets. If you fancy having a picture taking with a tango dancer you can but expect to pay a small fee. In addition to tango, La Boca is famous for its football, and you can take a tour of the La Bombonera Stadium where the buildings are painted in bright colors.
The prices for almost everything in La Boca tend to be 2 to 3 times higher compared to the rest of the city. It's very touristy since it is an enjoyable place with some authentic Argentine sights. La Boca is probably best to be enjoyed during the day when the streets are crowded and there are other tourists around, it is generally advised to be avoided at night.
There is no Subte to La Boca, but many buses go there.
<b>The Cementerio de la Recoleta</b>: This is where all the rich families in Buenos Aires have their final resting places. Expect to see big ornate tombs. Be sure to visit the tomb of Eva PerÃ³n, the daughter of an aristocrat and beloved First Lady who, despite having the most visited tomb in the cemetery, is considered by many to be too close toward the people for eternal interment in Recoleta.
<b>The Palermo Viejo district:</b> This is a trendy neighborhood with charming cobblestone streets, bookstores, bars, and boutiques; definitely better than the touristic San Telmo area for a nighttime excursion. The <i>Palermo</i> station, on D line, is the closest metro stop.
<b>San Telmo:</b>  Best visited on Sundays when tourists and locals alike flood in to attend the weekly street fair and flea market.  Be watchful for good deals, and bring in your own water, as it's quite expensive here.  On Sunday nights, there is a tango performance in the lovely plaza, which is specifically for tourists. (Visit an underground tango club for the most amateur experience. If there is advertising, or disco ball, then it's not an amateur)
Argentina has a renowned football reputation and the sport is big throughout the whole country including of course, Buenos Aires. The capital is the home town of two of the most appreciated football teams in the world, Boca Juniors (which resides in Boca) and River Plate (which formerly resides in Boca, but now resides in Belgrano). A game between these two legendary teams is called the "Super Clasico."  This is by far the hottest ticket in the city and the most intense rivalry in the world, so it is often necessary to buy tickets well in advance. Also, the Argentine National Team is very, very popular.  Tickets to their World Cup Qualifying matches can be difficult to come by, involve waiting in very long lines, and should be ordered in advance  for more convenience.
Argentinian fans are known for their passion and the songs (which are practically love songs) which they sing to their teams. Even if you are not a huge football fan, going to a game is definitely worth it just to take in the atmosphere and to observe the fans singing and cheering. While this is an experience you don't want to miss while visiting Buenos Aires, it can also be dangerous for tourists to go on their own depending on the stadium.
Tourists are often advised to go with large, organized groups with bilingual guides, in particular to a Boca Juniors game. This ensures that you can watch the game in peace and still have a great time. If you want to see a match on your own, the best choice is to see River Plate, in the rich northern suburb of Belgrano. Best to purchase a (more expensive, approx $100 pesos) Plateas (grandstand) ticket rather than being in the Populars (terraces, approx $60 pesos).
In the Plateas you can safely take your camera and enjoy the show. Don't worry about purchasing tickets in advance, often tickets go on sale only on match day, and as the stadiums are huge matches rarely sell out (except the above-mentioned SuperclÃ¡sico).
A trip to Buenos Aires is not complete without some sort of experience of the <b>Tango</b>, the national dance of Argentina. A good place to go and watch some authentic Tango is at the <b>Confiteria IdÃ©al</b> Suipacha 384 (just off of Corrientes, near Calle Florida. However Tango is best experienced not in La Boca and on Calle Florida, but in the <b>Milongas</b>. A milonga is both a place where a Tango dance will take place, as well as a specific type of tango dance.
Milongas take place either during the day or late at night. "MatinÃ©e Milongas" usually start in the early afternoon and go until 8-10PM. They are popular with tourists who may struggle staying up until 5AM every night. Inside a milongas, you will find many locals who will be more than willing to show you how to dance. The night Milongas officially start at around 11, but don't fill up until around 1:30. They may go on until 5 or 6 in the morning. Some Milongas to note are: <b>Salon Canning</b>, <b>El Beso</b> and <b>Porteno y Bailarin</b>.
There are many milongas held in different parts of the city every day. There's a free distribution guide called <b>TangoMap Guide</b> which contains all the information of the milongas day by day, including times and location. This guide also informs about tango teachers and tango shops, so it's the best reference for any tango lover. It it edited by <b>CaserÃ³n PorteÃ±o</b>, a <b>Tango Guest House</b> in Buenos Aires (<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.caseronporteno.com">http://www.caseronporteno.com</a>) that also gives free tango lessons every day for its guests.
You can start learning tango through the group lessons offered at many studios. Some popular schools are at the Centro Cultural Borges, on the very top floor. It can be very hard to find the actual place as there are some stairs you have to go up, and then you have to go through a museum. Ask the security officer where the "Escuela de Tango" <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.eatango.org">[14]</a> is. Take note that in the summer time the rooms can get very hot. The Centro is within the Galerias Pacifico, the American-style mall near Calle Florida on San Martin. The best way to learn, and the quickest, even if you do not have a partner, is with private lessons. You can find instructors who charge as little as US$40 per hour, all the way up to ones that will charge US$100 per hour. If you want to try the authentic style that the Argentines dance socially in the milongas, look up some of the milongueros who teach tango, like Alejandro Gee, Juan Manuel Suarez, Jorge Garcia, Jorge Kero. They will not only teach you traditional tango or milonga, but you can also find out a lot about the culture by hanging out with them. You can google them up for videos or in order to find them. Many of the more 'famous' instructors command a premium price. Be warned if you start taking tango lessons it will seduce and consume your life and you will then be force to make many pilgrimages back to Buenos Aires to dance.
<b>Tango Eyes</b><br />
If you don't want to dance be careful of the eye contact you make. Here, you will not see men physically getting up to ask a woman to dance. He will get her attention with his eyes, nod or make a "let's go" move with his head. If she accepts she will nod and smile, and they will both meet on the dance floor. The locals here are very friendly and if you are interested in learning tango, asking a local for instructors is the best bet.
If you prefer to start taking lessons in reduced groups and have personal attention, there are two tango oriented hotels with professional tango teachers who offer group tango lessons every day (free for their guests). One option is <i><b>CaserÃ³n PorteÃ±o</b></i> (<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.caseronporteno.com">http://www.caseronporteno.com</a>) and the other one
<i><b>Tango Lodge</b></i> (<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.tangolodge.com">http://www.tangolodge.com</a>). You can check the complete schedule for the tango lessons at their websites.
Spend a night seeing what it is like to be a real gaucho.  Live the life of an Argentine cowboy; ride horses, eat traditional gaucho foods, drink traditional gaucho wines, and dance like they used to do back in the day.  A great way to get out of the city for a day and see another side of Argentine culture. Great for adults, kids, or anybody who ever wanted to be a cowboy when they were younger.

Parrilla Tour Buenos Aires <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.parrillatour.com">[15]</a> leads walking tours around different neighborhoods several times a week.  During the tour, participants stop and sample traditional foods at 4 restaurants, 3 parrillas (steakhouses) and an artisanal ice cream shop, as well as learn about the history and culture around Argentine cuisine.  The stops chosen tend to be hole-in-the-wall, locals only, establishments not in guidebooks.
Argentina is renowned for its excellent selection of wine. The most popular being Mendoza which is rated amongst the worlds most popular regions due to its high altitude, volcanic soils and proximity to the Andes Mountains. The terrain seems to complement the European grape varietals with interesting notes not present when produced in other climates, this allows the Argentine wine to be positioned in a league of its own.
The best way to experience and understand the selection of Argentine varietals is a wine tasting, which is offered by quite a few companies and bars around the city.
Anuva Wines <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.anuvawines.com/affiliate/?referrer=pubcrawlba&amp;target=/wine-tastings/visiting-buenos-aires/book/">[16]</a> is one of the best wine tastings in Buenos Aires.

Usually they are organized in Recoleta or Palermo, and consist of several design and fashion stores along a street that open their doors to wineries who want to offer their wines. Very nice atmosphere, sometimes with jazz and classic live musicians playing in the streets.

The city of Buenos Aires and its suburban surroundings cover a tremendous expanse of land that cannot be easily and quickly walked, biked, or driven. That is what helicopter rides are for. You can discover Buenos Aires from a unique perspective: see the skyline of Puerto Madero's skyscrapers, the grid of concrete streets filled with taxis and colectivos or buses, the tourist attractions including the Obelisco, Casa Rosada, and Cementario Recoleta. Tour the skies above the human traffic on an exciting helicopter ride, a different way to explore the city.
You might not think of it as you walk around this big city of skyscrapers, but there is some very good golfing very close by.  There are many trips to the golf courses that make it easy and relaxing for tourists to enjoy a day on the green. . Packages include any greens fees, equipment and a caddie who you can blame when you hook that shot into the woods!

This is a great way to see a different side of Buenos Aires that most people wouldn't think about seeing. Kosher Restaurants are available in Palermo, Once (or Balvanera). There's even a Kosher Mc Dondald's (the other is in Israel) at the Abasto Shopping Mall.
Recently, more urban spas or day spas have flourished, some of them at large hotels such as the Alvear, Hilton, Hyatt among others. Furthermore, some green spas have opened shops and offer a great range of eco-friendly treatments.

Many people interested in learning Spanish choose Argentina as an inexpensive destination to accomplish this. You will hear Argentines refer to Spanish as Castellano more often than EspaÃ±ol, which betrays the county's individuality when it comes to the language, though there is logic behind their use of Castellano. Spain has several languages. The dominant language is Castilian or Castellano, which is the primary dialect spoken in Spain, and the language of communication for all of Spanish-speaking Latin America. Spanish in Buenos Aires is Rioplatense Spanish. The Spanish of Argentina uses the verb form of voseo instead of tÃº. While the Spanish of Argentina is beautiful, it is slightly unusual sounding to the rest of Latin America. You might also pick up a little of the slang of Buenos Aires known as Lunfardo, and is influenced by several other languages.
There are several options for studying Spanish. You can attend one of several fine schools, study individually with a tutor, or there are social groups where people get together for the purpose of talking in each others languages to improve their skills.
There's one Spanish School that is specialized in the language for tango and addressed at tango lovers (even when they teach anyone interested in their lessons). It is called LyCBA and also has teachers who can attend to the place where the person is staying. For more information, see: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.tangospanish.com">http://www.tangospanish.com</a>
Schools provide a very rigorous schedule, typically, of intense study. Be wise, if you have spent 3 weeks in classes and find yourself getting overwhelmed, a week off will help your brain catch up. There is the occasional student who has been in classes for 6 weeks who's brain is clearly suffering from overload.
The schools would rather keep you in class, so it's up to you to pace yourself.
You can expect, given their foreign press, a higher concentration of the younger backpacker crowd and a higher turnover of students. There has also been observed a high turnover of teachers and other difficulties.
This school, which offers both Spanish and English classes as well as a translation service, is known for its personalized approach to teaching by creating tailor made programmes for students. Using only qualified teachers who are all native speakers, the school also offers an activity programme and accommodation options.
The school is open all year round. Students can start any Monday.
Events take place almost nightly in bars and restaurants throughout the city.
Many very qualified teachers advertise on Craigslist <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://buenosaires.en.craigslist.org/lss/">[39]</a>, which is more known by foreigners on the Buenos Aires page than locals. Often these teachers have formal education in teaching language and prior or current experience in a school of language.
Employment is available for Spanish-speaking visitors in Buenos Aires.  Many foreigners work as translators, or English teachers.  There's also a recent trend for technology and recruiting companies hiring English-speaking or bilingual employees.
It is very common for foreigners to work in call centers. There are companies that provide customer care and technical support services to many big American and European companies like Microsoft, Verizon, Vodafone, Motorola and others. If you speak just a bit of Spanish, you can get this kind of job. It should be noted that wages in call centers are much less than in countries like the USA, far lower than the difference in the cost of living. In 2007, typical wages were 1/5 of the typical rate for the same work in the USA, while living costs were between 1/3 and 1/2. Many foreigners from "richer countries" find it very hard to survive in Buenos Aires for very long unless they have other funds.
If you wish to work, remember to obtain proper immigration status so as to be able to work legally. It is possible to convert your tourist visa into a work permit, but you need to bring with you a letter of good conduct for your country of residence and a birth certificate. Both documents has to have apostille and a certified translation to Spanish if they are not already in this language. You may find the latest requisites at "DirecciÃ³n Nacional de Migraciones" <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.migraciones.gov.ar/">[40]</a>. Some employers may still offer you work under less than formal terms, but be reminded that if you accept this sort of employment you may not receive the full benefits that are mandated by law and are actually 'helping' that employer break a good number of local laws.
<b>Also you could receive assistance form a good immigration advisor, who could get your legal residence approved in days and also find you a job.</b>
Shops at shopping malls and Supermarkets are usually open from 10:00 to 22:00 hrs, 7 days a week. Non-chain, small stores usually close around 20:00 and stay closed on Saturday afternoons and Sundays except on big avenues and touristic areas. All of the main avenues are full with kiosks and very small convenience stores that stay open 24 hours. You will find no less than 2 for each 100 meters you walk. In the Recoleta area, several bookstores and record stores close as late as 2:30AM daily.
The Argentinian currency is the Peso (Argentinian Peso; ARS). A 100 Pesos bill can be hard to break, so avoid changing round numbers so you get some change (e.g. when changing money change the amount that will give you 90 Pesos instead of 100 Pesos). Coins are rare and they are required for buses, so try not to spend them in stores.
Money can be exchanged at <i>Banco de la NaciÃ³n Argentina</i> at the airport and at any of the <b>cambios</b> (<b>changes</b>) along Florida or Lavalle, but, if you have the time, shop around for the best rate at the zone known as "La city". This zone is the banking district of Buenos Aires, and numerous exchange places are located right near one another. This mean fierce competition and options to check the best rates. In addition to this, in this zone is possible not only to change US Dollars or Euros, but also some other major currencies from Latin America (such as Brazilian Reals, Mexican Pesos, Colombian Pesos, etc), Canadian Dollars, Asian (Japanese Yens, Chinese Renminbis, etc), and Europe (Swedish Kronas, Swiss Francs, etc). This can mean a saving of time and money by not having to convert 2 times. Take into consideration that wherever you go to an official money changer, you are always officially required to present your passport and copies are not acceptable.
Do know that, at the current time, there are two exchange rates for foreign currencies: the official rate and the Â¨blueÂ¨rate. The official rate is what the government prescribes and this is what you get when you change at banks or when you extract local pesos with your credit cards at the ATM. The official rate is usually much lower than the blue rate. To get the blue rate, you will need to exchange your dollars/euros at various places such as Florida street and other cuevas. Do note that while the blue rate exchange is not fully legal, pretty much everyone here in Argentina does this. As of mid November 2013, the blue rate is 1 USD for 10 pesos, whereas the official rate is 1 USD for 6 pesos. Also try to plan your budget while in Argentina because if you want to change your local pesos to dollars, you are pretty much limited to changing at the blue rate since banks will not buy your pesos at the official rate.
<b>Traveller's Checks</b> are rarely used and may actually be difficult to exchange, but there is an American Express office at San Martin Plaza that will take American Express' Traveller's Checks. Banco Frances will cash them with proper identification, and are located all over B.A., including around tourist attractions such as El Obelesco.
<b>Banks</b> open from 10:00 to 15:00 and only on weekdays. <i>Banelco</i> or "Red Link" ATMs can be found around the city, but banks and ATMs are few and far between in residential neighborhoods like <a href="/en/Palermo" title="Palermo">Palermo</a>. Try major roads near metro stations. ATMs are the most convenient source of cash but should be used only in banks or ATMs that acted as the banks' branches.
<b>ATM limits and fees|</b> Some ATMs strictly limit withdrawals on foreign cards. You may be able to get out only 300 Pesos per day, so plan to visit the ATM often or hunt around for a more relaxed limit. The Citibank multipurpose ATMs are currently the only ones allowing withdrawals over 300 Pesos per day (probably up to the limit of your card). Otherwise, look for ATMs in the Link network. Banco Patagonico has a limit of 600 Pesos. The Visa Plus network of ATM cards have a lower limit of 320 Pesos per withdrawal with U$5-6 fee. Fees vary wildly from nothing to US$5-6. Read the fine print!}} As of July 2011, all ATMs in the Link and Banelco networks are charging a 16 Pesos fee for withdrawals from American cards. As these are the only two ATM networks to be found in Buenos Aires, plan accordingly. Cash exchange rates for US Dollars are very competitive, and it may be advantageous to simply bring a large sum of US currency.
<b>Fees</b> for banking may be from both your bank and the Argentinian bank. Specific fee amounts depends on your bank and the ATM you use; most ATMs will charge foreign travellers around US$5-$7 per transaction, which will be added to your withdrawal amount. Sometimes the machines also dispense US Dollars for international bank cards that are members of the Cirrus and PLUS networks. Visitors from Brazil can find many Banco ItaÃº agencies all over the city.
<b>Change</b> is a problem in Buenos Aires as there is a seeming shortage of coins. The locals give two basic reasons for it. The first being that the metal is worth more than the value of the coin so people sell their coins to scrap metal merchants, or the other reason is that the bus system requires all trips to be paid for with coins so there is a shortage in a city of 13 million people. Whatever the reason, if you buy an item that costs 4 Pesos and 60 cents, almost always expect to pay with the correct amount of money. Some shopkeepers sometimes hope that the purchaser will simply say 'keep the change'. However, this is not the case if you use larger bills at bigger stores (such as a chain store like Carrefour) for purchases.
Credit cards are very widely accepted in the city center and Recoleta, and it is not an issue to use a card for a small purchase such as lunch (though there will be a fee for using a card).
Credit cards are used less commonly in Argentina than in the USA or Europe. However, most tourist-oriented businesses accept credit cards, although sometimes with an additional handling fee to offset the fee that the merchants have to pay to the credit card networks.
When making purchases with your credit card, in many cases (at least in Cordoba) you will be required to show some ID. If you are a tourist, a photocopy of your passport will suffice (that saves you carrying your passport around). You will need to write down your passport number on the credit card slip when you sign it. Some stores also require a phone number.
Saturdays and Sundays are great days for the outdoor markets, especially in the summer.
While the primary consumption of Argentinians is beef, there are other options in this cosmopolitan city. Italian food is pervasive but in neighborhoods like Palermo, pizza joints are seeing heavy competition from sushi, fusion, and even vegetarian bistros. Just about everything can be delivered - including fantastic, gourmet <i>helado</i> (ice cream).
You will want to try <i>asado</i> (beef/steak barbecue) at a <i>parrilla</i>, restaurants specializing in roasted meats. There are expensive <i>parrillas</i>, and more simple and cost effective ones, In either case you will likely have some of the best "meat" you have ever tasted. The <i>bife de lomo</i> (tenderloin) is unbelievably tender.
As matter in fact. the first regular [<a class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reefer_ship">| Refrigator ship</a>] is the Steamers <i>Le Frigorifique</i> and <i>Paraguay</i>, that carried frozen mutton from Argentina to France.
Jugoso means rare (literally "juicy"), however the Argentine concept of rare is very different from that of someone from the States (perhaps its a tourist thing, but an American ordering rare is likely to get something between medium well and hockey puck). Argentines cook their meat all the way through, and they can only get away with this method because the meat is so tender that cooking it well does not necessarily mean it's shoe leather.
For Westerners, don't be afraid to order "azul" ("blue"), you will not get a blue steak, more like an American Medium Rare. If you like your meat "bloody", or practically "still walking" it might pay to learn words like "sangre" ("blood"), or to make statements like "me gusta la sangre" ("I like the blood"). Don't be afraid to spend two minutes stressing how rare you want your steak to your waiter- this is something no one talks about in guidebooks but every other American and Brit once you arrive will tell you the same thing, if you want it rare, you have to explain exactly how rare.
Only the most old school <i>parrillas</i> (grills) don't offer at least one or two pasta dishes and pizza is everywhere.
Italian and Spanish food are almost native here, as the cultural heritage heralds in great part from these two countries. Other popular meals are pizzas and <i>empanadas</i> (small pastries stuffed with a combination of cheese and meats). They are a popular home delivery or takeaway/takeout option.
<b>Pizza</b> is a strong tradition in Buenos Aires. It comes <i>al molde</i> (cooked in a pan, usually medium to thick crust), <i>a la piedra</i> (baked in a stone oven, usually thin to medium crust), and <i>a la parilla</i> (cooked on a parilla grill, very thin, crispy crust). Best places: "Los Inmortales", "Las Cuartetas", "GuerrÃ­n", Â·El Cuartito", "Banchero's", "Kentucky", "La Mezzetta" , "El Fortin".
"El Cuartito" in Recoleta has a delicious "Fugazzeta rellena" pizza.  This restaurant can be packed with families and friends even at midnight.
"La Mezzetta" also sells "Fugazzetta rellena" and is a very traditional place at which in Fridays you may finde a queu that starts outside the restaurant.
In "Guerrin", ask for a slice of pizza muzarella with a glass of Moscato.
<b>Yo Soy Vegetariano</b><br />
In Buenos Aires, as in the rest of the Argentina, beef is served everywhere. However vegetarians need not despair in Buenos Aires. No less than a dozen vegetarian oriented bistros have popped up in the last few years (notable in <a href="/en/Palermo" title="Palermo">Palermo</a>) and many spots popular with tourists offer inventive vegetarian versions of traditional meals.
<b>Vegan</b> food is available at these restaurants:
One incredible and typical Argentinian kind of "cookie", is the alfajor, which  consists of two round sweet biscuits joined together with a sweet jam, generally <i>dulce de leche</i> (milk jam, akin to caramel), covered with chocolate, meringue or something similarly sweet.
GuÃ­a Ãleo <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.guiaoleo.com">[43]</a>, a local restaurant guide, includes a listing and rating of almost every restaurant in the entire city (in Spanish).

Do not expect service to be comparable to large cities in Europe or in the USA. Don't expect your waiter to take your drinks order when the menu is delivered and don't expect the menu to arrive very quickly. If you want service, attract the waiters' attention, s/he will never come over to take your empty plate etc, unless they want to close.
Patience is the key. Argentinians as so accustomed to the relaxed service that they don't bother to complain directly to the waiter, but only commented toward fellow Argentinans. Speak out to the waiters if you feel it is appropriate.
There are a lot of <i>al paso</i> (walk through) places to eat; you eat standing up or in high chairs at the bar. Meals vary from hot-dogs (<i>panchos</i>), beef sausages (<i>chorizos</i>, or its sandwich version <i>choripÃ¡n</i>), pizzas, <i>milanesas</i> (breaded fried cutlets), etc.  Don't forget to indulge in the perennially popular mashed squash - it is delicious and often comes with rice and makes a full meal in itself. It is perfect for vegetarians and vegans to fill up on. <br />
If you like to eat cheap while enjoying the flair of one of the buildings of the huge university of Buenos Aires you should hop of LÃ­nea D (verde/green) at Faculdad de Medicina and enter the building of UBA - Ciencias EconÃ³micas. The student's restaurant in the inner courtyard has a variety of very cheap breakfast and lunch offers. Vegetarian and vegan alternatives available! It is possible that other faculties offer restaurants as well.
You can go to a huge variety of small restaurants, with cheap and generous servings, most notably the ones owned by Spanish and Italian immigrants. There are also many places which offer foreign meals, mostly Japanese, Chinese, Thai, Arabic, Spanish, and Italian.
The most expensive and luxurious restaurants are found in the <a href="/en/Buenos_Aires/Puerto_Madero" title="Buenos Aires/Puerto Madero">Puerto Madero</a> zone, near downtown, heading to the River Plate.
But the nicer places in terms of decoration, food and personality are in <a href="/en/Buenos_Aires/Palermo" title="Buenos Aires/Palermo">Buenos_Aires/Palermo</a>.
The main areas to go out are: Puerto Madero, close to the Casa Rosada. Safe during the day and night, due the obvious reason (Casa Rosada).

Palermo SoHo and Palermo Hollywood  are full of trendy stores, restaurants, and young and trendy bars. Palermo Las CaÃ±itas is another nice area close to the Polo stadium.  Also, San Telmo has a very bohemian, and very fun, nightlife scene. Buenos Aires has a popular cafe culture.
Buenos Aires has a great variety of clubs and discos that are open until late hours (6AM or 7AM) and bars that stay open 24 hours a day. Have in mind that at closing times the streets will be swarmed with people trying to get home, so it isn't easy to get a taxi and the public transportation will be very busy.
Young teens are used to staying out and by-passing the little security, so be cautious when engaging girls in provocative clothing. They might try to hit off with foreigners as part of a dare with their friends. The famous Palermo Barrios (SoHo, Hollywood, Las CaÃ±itas or simply "PalVo") have many hip restaurants that turn into bars as it gets later.
Buenos Aires has a tradition of rock concerts going on all the time. Most of the time top international artist include several dates on their tour in Buenos Aires. Football stadiums are frequently used for the concerts.

There is an enormous number (more than 150) of hostels. In the more famous hostels, booking in advance might be necessary, but you'll always find a dorm bed if you need it. There are many budget hotels where you can get your own room for no more than 55 to 75 pesos ($15 or $20) per night. You will not find them advertised on the internet. They can be hard to find, but there are many. Walk down Avenida de Mayo near CafÃ© Tortoni. Start from Avenida 9 de Julio (the giant, wide one) and make your way towards the Plaza de Mayo. Look on the small side streets plus or minus two blocks and you will find many of these places.
NB: Unlike most South American cities, the better Buenos Aires hostels will be fully booked at weekends. You can always find something, but if you want a specific hostel, book in advance.
The <b>Regal Pacific Hotel</b> Beautiful 5 star boutique hotel, fantastic location. 25 de Mayo 764, Buenos Aires 1002 ABP, Argentina. <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.regal-pacific.com/bs">http://www.regal-pacific.com/bs</a>
The <b>InterContinental</b> is on Piedras and Moreno streets, close to the San Telmo and Montserrat areas. Other international-class hotels are the <b>Alvear Palace Hotel</b> (<i>said to be the most luxurious hotel in South America</i>) in Recoleta, the <b>Hilton</b> in Puerto Madero, the Marriott-Plaza, the <b>Sheraton</b> in Retiro, and the <b>Park Hyatt</b> Buenos Aires - Palacio Duhau in Recoleta.
There are also many suites-only hotels like the Broadway Suites which are very close to the Obelisk. The stylish and Bohemian Palermo Soho and Palermo Viejo neighborhoods are home to some of the trendiest small boutique hotels in Buenos Aires. These hotels offer the amenities of their larger international chain counterparts, plus a more personal style of service, often at a fraction of the cost.
Many people travel in Buenos Aires without incident, but as with any large city crime is an issue for tourists and residents alike. Conduct yourself intelligently as you would in any large city. Be especially careful at night, and stay away from squares.
The most frequent incidents of crime involve distraction theft, bag snatching, and armed robberies in the street, in taxis and in restaurants. Distraction thefts commonly occur in public areas such as internet cafes, train stations, and bus stations. You should keep a close eye on your personal possessions and bags at all times. In some public spaces you will find that chairs with webbing and clips to clip to your bag or purse to the chair. An aid in avoiding problems is, dress to blend in and avoid carrying lots of items. It is safer to travel with just the bare necessities in your front pocket.
While using public transportation or walking around common sense should be used (as in every big city).
In a common scam one person sprays something on the victim like hand cream mustard or the like. Another person tries to help the victim. There can be several people at once working in coordination. The object is to distract you from your belongings and, in the chaos, steal from you. Avoiding confrontation is their object so do the same. Ignore their 'help', just focus on your belongings and extracting yourself from the scene.
Another common occurrence is the slitting of handbags in crowded places. Be particularly attentive in popular tourist areas, such as San Telmo.  You should avoid carrying large amounts of cash or wearing ostentatious jewelery.
The dangers of hailing a taxi has received lots of press but is not common. Petty crime continues (like taking indirect routes or incorrect changes during payment). Taxicabs that loiter in front of popular tourist destinations like the National Museum are looking for tourists, and some of these drivers are less honest than others. Do things like the  locals would be a good choice, like stopping a cab a block or two away on a typical city street.
If a woman (or even a man) apparently normally calls you on the street to see an "apresentaciÃ³n" and earn massage girls for free, without commitment, the first time, do not pay attention and leave! In fact, they are agents of brothels. Once taken  "inside", they do not let you out, physically preventing you, until they disburse a large sum of money. This type of scam is relatively common in the center, especially in Corrientes Avenue, Florida Street, and Lavalle Avenue.
<b>Counterfeit money</b> is frequent, especially from a regular exchanger of currencies from people of various lifestyles (like taxi drivers), so be on the lookout for counterfeit bank notes being given with your change. Some counterfeit notes are very well done and may even have what appears to be a watermark. Get to know the notes and exactly what they look and feel like, also identify the water marks and serial numbers. When exiting a taxi, hold up your notes to the light to check them before final exit, or better yet, use exact change in taxis.
Be careful of counterfeit money. There have been occasions where genuine bills have been exchanged for counterfeit  ones. Counterfeit bills are mostly fifties, given as changes. Hundreds are frequently given back to tourists by deceiving exchangers claiming that counterfeit bills were given to them, after they have switched the bill given to them with a fake one. Using exact or almost exact changes will pretty much solve most of this kind of problems.
Don't accept torn or damaged bills, as they are difficult to use.
Characteristics of good currency can be found at the Argentine Central Bank web site <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.bcra.gov.ar/">[111]</a>.
As any large airports in many countries, there are records of airport staff stealing from the passengers.
In July of 2007, Argentina's TV network "Canal 13" conducted an investigation revealing that several security operators at the airport are stealing valuable objects such as iPods, digital cameras, cellular phones, sun glasses, jewelry, laptops, and other valueables while scanning the luggages of passengers.
According to the special report, security operators at the airport are supposed to check each luggage before putting it into the plane; however, some operators take advantage of the scanner machine to detect valuable objects and steal them. The report states that this event occurs every day. The stolen items include anything from electronic devices to perfumes and works of art or even expensive clothes (such as football jerseys or leather coats).
Travelers and residents are strongly encouraged to <b>place high-value items in your carry-on luggage</b> to prevent any incidents. However, since these carry-on luggages will be scanned too before being carried into the plane, their insides are also at risk of being stolen. With the staff or accomplice distracting the passengers (usually when the staff is searching  for any metal or other item on the passenger), while another staff or accomplice steal the items. Another extra accomplice from outside the airport will usually pick up the items later.
Wrapping your baggage and carry-on luggage when leaving and arriving is an idea, since for only around US$16,50. you can discourage robbers from opening (and probably breaking) it,. However for checked-in baggage, it can not be used for passengers exiting and entering the U.S.A., since the T.S.A. demanded that all checked-in baggage to be easily accessible. While wrapping a carry-on luggage will pretty much also denied you of quick access to the carry-on luggage.
Before and after check-in, It would be better to carry only 1 carry-on item and place all of your items (including tickets, wallets, handphones,, any metal such like a beltbuckle, and so on) securely inside and not easily accessiblle, requiring the entire carry-on item to be stolen and only 1 item to be watched upon. Travelling in groups will also allow you to divide the task of minding your belongings, one person or more can guard the belongings, while another one is being scanned by the metal detector.
The plumbing <b>water</b> in Buenos Aires, unlike in many Latin American cities, is drinkable straight from the tap.
<b>Public hospitals</b> are   available for tourists, with 24 hr emergency service, without charge.
There are many stray animals in the city. They usually do not cause harm, but be careful not to touch them as they may harbor diseases and you may not be aware of their temperament.
