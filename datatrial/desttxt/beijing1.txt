Peking man, Ming dynasty emperors, Chairman Mao and 17 million residents have made their mark on modern-day Beijing. A capital of exhilarating extremes with its glittering skyscrapers, mazy hutongs and enigmatic Forbidden City -- nowhere is China's rapid progress and rich imperial history more tangible. But in a city so enormous, it's the little experiences that are most memorable -- whether it's graceful tai chi moves in the parks, spicy hot pot on lantern-lit Ghost Street or the lakefront serenity of the Summer Palace.

Things to Do
<b>sdfasdf</b>
<i></i>
Step past the huge Chairman Mao portrait guarding Tiananmen Square and back to an age of Ming dynasty emperors and tittering concubines roaming the mysterious Forbidden City -- off limits to the public for 500 years. Local history comes alive in the atmospheric warren of hutongs, narrow alleys best explored by pedicab. Locals meet for early morning tai chi in front of the pagoda-like Temple of Heaven and quiet contemplation in the pavillions and manicured gardens of the lakeside Summer Palace.

Shopping

Join the throngs at Hongqiao Market to haggle for pearls, high-tech gadgets and brilliantly colored silks or tailor-made clothes at Ya Show Market. The mood is more upmarket in designer-lined Wangfujing, where the Arts & Crafts World Mansion stocks Chinese crafts from jade to intricate wood carvings. Bordering the hutongs and centered on remodeled Qing dynasty siheyuan courtyard houses, Liulichang Xi Jie is an atmospheric street to pause for tea and shop for antiques, name chops and calligraphy brushes.

Nightlife and Entertainment

On warm evenings, the city's parks and streets fill with Beijingers ballroom dancing and working out to taped music. Houhai Lake is a backdrop for late-night dining, cocktails and twilight boat rides. Continue the party at the neon-lit Sanlitun district, where bars pulsate to DJ beats and live jazz. The graceful moves and colorful theatrics of Peking opera come alive at the traditional Liyuan Theater and Lao She Teahouse, where performances are complemented by jasmine tea and baozi (steamed buns).

Restaurants and Dining

With chopstick know-how and a little Mandarin, you can enjoy an inexpensive feast of staples like jiaozi (Chinese dumplings) and crispy Peking duck dripping in plum sauce. Lanterns cast a red glow over Gui Jie, or Ghost Street, peppered with 24-hour hole-in-the-wall restaurants ladling out Beijing's spiciest hot pot. International cuisine from pizza to mezze is served in chic surrounds in Chaoyang District and on Houhai Lake's banks. Brace your tastebuds for scorpions, deep-fried grasshoppers and starfish at the wonderfully weird Wangfujing Night Market.


<b>Beijing</b> (åŒ—äº¬ <i>BÄ›ijÄ«ng</i>) is the capital of the most populous country in the world, the <a href="/en/China" title="China">People's Republic of China</a>, and also its second largest city after <a href="/en/Shanghai" title="Shanghai">Shanghai</a>. It was also the seat of the Ming and Qing dynasty emperors until the formation of a republic in 1911. Beijing is the political, educational and cultural centre of the country and as such it is rich in historical sites and important government and cultural institutions.
The city is well known for its flatness and regular construction. There are only three hills to be found in the city limits (in Jingshan Park to the north of the famous Forbidden City). Like the configuration of the Forbidden City, Beijing has concentric "ring roads", which are actually rectangular, that go around the metropolis.
Beijing was host to the 2008 Summer Olympic Games.
Beijing has a total of 14 districts and 2 counties. In 2010, Xuanwu District was merged into Xicheng, and Chongwen District was merged into Dongcheng. Wikitravel continues to use the old districts. And according to the old districts, there are 8 urban districts, 6 rural districts and 2 counties(PolyU).
.
The four central districts are located within or just beyond Second Ring Road and make-up the old walled city of yesteryear.  Along with Chaoyang District (a massively-sized district larger than the four central districts combined), this is where most visitors will find an overwhelming majority of the sights and lodging, dining and entertainment options.  The districts are:
Other than Chaoyang and the southeast corner of Haidian, the following districts are not as popular for visitors (save for when going to visit the Great Wall, however, which for most visitors is the only location which would required a jaunt outside of the more densely-packed districts).  The districts are:
The remaining ten districts and counties are quite far from the centre.
Beijing literally means <i>Northern Capital</i>, a role it has played many times in China's long history.  Beijing's history dates back several thousand years but it first became notable in Chinese history after it was made the capital of the State of Yan under the name <i>Yanjing</i>. Yan was one of the major kingdoms of the Warring States Period, some 2,000 years ago.  After the fall of Yan, during the later Han and Tang dynasties, the Beijing-area was a major prefecture of northern China.
In 938, Beijing<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.map-china.com/beijing-local.shtml.htm">[1]</a> was conquered by the Khitans and declared the capital of the Liao Dynasty. The Mongols seized the city in 1215. From 1264 Beijing served as the capital of a united China under Kublai Khan. His victorious Mongol forces renamed the city, <i>Great Capital</i> (å¤§éƒ½). From there, Kublai and his decedents ruled their empire from a northern location closer to the Mongol homelands. During this period, the walled city was enlarged and many palaces and temples were built.
After the fall of the Mongol-founded Yuan dynasty in 1368, the capital was initially moved to <a href="/en/Nanjing" title="Nanjing">Nanjing</a>. However, in 1403 the 3rd Ming emperor, Zhu Di, also known as Emperor Yongle, moved it back to Beijing and gave the city its present name. The Ming period was Beijing's <i>golden era.</i> The Forbidden City, the Temple of Heaven and many other Beijing landmarks were built in this period. The capital developed into a huge city becoming the religious and cultural center of Asia.
In 1644, the Manchus overthrew the declining Ming dynasty and established China's last imperial line - the Qing. Despite the changing political climate, Beijing remained the capital. The Manchu imperial family moved into the Forbidden City and remained there until 1911. The Qing built both the Summer Palace and Old Summer Palace. These served as summer retreats for the emperors and their entourages. During the 19th century, Western countries established foreign legations in the Qianmen area south of the Forbidden City. These came under siege during the Boxer Rebellion in 1900.
The Qing dynasty fell in 1911.  In the chaotic first years of Republican China, Beijing was beset by fighting warlords.  Following the Northern Expedition, the Kuomintang moved the capital to Nanjing in 1928, and renamed Beijing as <i>Beiping</i> ("Northern Peace") to emphasize that it was no longer a capital. Beijing remained a center for education and culture throughout the Republican Era. When the Kuomintang was  defeated by the Communists in 1949, the new government proclaimed a People's Republic with its capital at Beijing.

Beijing is characterised by its vastness and large distances between locations.  Until recently, the city was almost entirely made up of hutongs with narrow lanes and single story buildings.  Now, many of the hutongs have given way to broad boulevards and modern buildings, contributing to an airy, sprawling feel, in sharp contrast to cities like <a href="/en/Hong_Kong" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a> and <a href="/en/Shanghai" title="Shanghai">Shanghai</a>.
Beijing is the political centre of the country with official buildings and embassy areas dominating the city. Beijing is also the historical and cultural centre of China with many historical buildings and sites - especially within Ring Road Two.  The city has undergone rapid modernisation in recent years, with improvements of institutions, business environment and work conditions.
Given their city's historical, cultural and political heft, Beijingers are justifiably proud to be citizens of the capital. An attitude known as å¤§åŒ—äº¬ä¸»ä¹‰ or "Great Beijing-ism" is often used to describe their attitude toward people from other regions of China. They are often much more interested in politics and willing to talk about current events than people elsewhere in China. Beijingers also seem to focus on not losing face and often use humor in order to do so. However, many Chinese from other provinces find Beijingers very friendly and straightforward compared with people from Shanghai especially.
Beijing has a monsoon-influenced continental climate with hot, humid summers and cold, dry winters. The best time to visit is in September and October, during the "Golden Autumn" (é‡‘ç§‹). Spring is the season for dust storms and is otherwise warm and dry. Summer can be oppressively hot and the tourist crowds tend to be the largest as well; prevailing winds from the south trap pollutants (mountains lie to the north and west), making summer the worst season for air quality. Winter is cold and dry with infrequent, but beautiful, snow. Temperatures can easily fall below âˆ’10 Â°C in winter and or just as readily rise above 35 Â°C in summer as well.
Beijing has a population of 17.55 million people (30% migrants) living on 16,800 km2 distributed in 18 districts.  The city borders Hebei Province to the north, west and south and Tianjin Municipality to the east.
<b>Scams at the airport</b><br />
<b>Arrival</b>: Using taxis other than those in the official taxi queue on ground level is not advised. The queue manager will help by pointing out the taxi you are to go to. Do not bother with impostors who pretend to work for the taxi company pose at the official-looking stands outside offering rides to the city (especially in the non-regular hours where there are not many people about). You will be led into a "taxi" with a fake meter (which could be out of sight) which runs very quickly (3-5 times the normal rate).  Read the <a href="#By_taxi">section on taxis</a> for details on how to distinguish between fake and legitimate taxis.
<b>Departure</b>: For some time, the airport construction/exit surcharge has been incorporated into the price of the airline ticket so simply ignore anyone attempting to con you into this. Your airline will be sure to inform you of any extra fees upon arriving at the counter!
<b>Beijing Capital International Airport</b> (åŒ—äº¬é¦–éƒ½å›½é™…æœºåœº <i>BÄ›ijÄ«ng ShÇ’udÅ« GuÃ³jÃ¬ JÄ«chÇŽng</i>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IATA" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:IATA">IATA</a>: <b>PEK</b>) <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://en.bcia.com.cn/">[2]</a> is located to the northeast of the central districts, 26 km from the city centre. The airport has three terminals, broadly speaking divided as follows:
Travel between Terminals 1 and 2 is via a long corridor with travelators. A fit person can make the route in about 10 minutes. A free shuttle bus runs between Terminal 2 and 3. It departs every ten minutes or so (every 30 minutes from 23:00-06:00), and the journey time is about 10 minutes. Terminal 3 is huge: it alone is bigger than all five of Heathrow (London)'s terminals. Additional time should be allocated when flying from here.  Minimum check in times vary, but generally close 30 minutes before departure for domestic flights, and 1 hour for international flight.
Facilities on arrival include ATMs and money changers. There also shared computer and wifi zone with power outlets to access Internet (need either to scan your ID/passport, or get a SMS code by phone). Be aware that upon departure, porters may want Â¥10 to wheel your bags 50 m to check-in and that most eating options are rather outrageously priced.  Before you cross through security, if you want a bite to eat in the Terminal 1, there is a KFC, and in Terminal 2, there are 2 KFCs, and the restaurants in the basement have relatively low prices compared to what's above. A meal at any of these places should be around Â¥20.
Many people use <b>taxicabs</b> to reach town from the airport. Try to get the Chinese name in characters of your hotel so that you can let your taxi driver read where you want to go. A taxi from the airport should cost Â¥70-120. You will have to pay the fee shown on the meter (make sure the driver uses it) plus Â¥10 toll for the airport expressway.  Traffic jams are common. If you are moving during night, taxis are your sole option as earliest arrival time at airport is 06:30 by public transport (taking first subway 05:30 depending on station and first Airport Express 06:00/Â¥25/~20-30min to T3 or T2)
The <b>Airport Express</b> train runs in a one-way loop from T3 to T2/T1, then Sanyuanqiao (transfer to subway Line 10) and Dongzhimen (Lines 2, 13).  A one-way fare is Â¥25, and the trip takes about 20 minutes from Dongzhimen to T3, 30 min to T2.   There is often a poorly formed queue to buy tickets although fast moving.
Please note, although the last <b>Airport Express</b> train leaves airport to city at around 23:00, the subway lines normally stop operating before 23:00.  You probably can not connect any subway line if you take a late <b>Airport Express</b> train and finding a legitimate taxi around the subway station during the night can be challenging.  Therefore, if your flight arrives Beijing airport after 22:30, you'd better to use other transportation instead.
Do not take the train just to get from T3 to T2/T1, as this will cost you the full Â¥25; use the free shuttle bus instead.  Trains are short, and not too frequent meaning that the trains are often very full with no space for luggage or anywhere to sit.  There are security checks before you get on the train, and include x-raying luggageâ€¦.sadly, only small, waist high scanners are in operation, meaning you have to lift large and heavy bags, and shove them through.
A slightly cheaper way to get to the city centre is to take the <span class='vcard' id = 'airport_shuttle'><span class="fn org">airport shuttle</span> (<span class="nickname"><span class="non-latin">æœºåœºå·´å£«</span> JÄ«chÇŽng BÄ shÃ¬</span>), <span class="tel"><abbr class="type" title="voice">â˜Ž</abbr> <span class="phone value">+86 10 64594375 / 64594376</span></span>, <a class="url external autonumber" href="http://en.bcia.com.cn/traffic/airbus/index.shtml" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. <span class="hours">Buses for each route leave every 10-30 minutes</span>. <span class="description">There are several lines running to different locations throughout Beijing.

<br />
The cheapest (Â¥2) way would be to take public bus #359, which runs from the airport to Dongzhimen, where you can catch subway Line 2 or 13, but this is not very fast or convenient (1h + 10 min walk from airport).
A number of youth hostels and luxury hotels run their own complimentary shuttle buses services - ask the place where you are staying if they have one.
<b>Nanyuan Airport</b> (å —è‹‘æœºåœº <i>NÃ¡nyuÃ n JÄ«chÇŽng</i>, IATA: <b>NAY</b>) is a former military airfield 17 km to the south of Beijing, currently used only by army-linked low-cost operator China United (ä¸­å›½è ”å ˆ <i>ZhÅ ngguÃ³ LiÃ¡nhÃ©</i>) <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://cu-air.com/">[4]</a>.  China United runs flights (in cooperation with their owner China Eastern) flights to major cities including <a href="/en/Harbin" title="Harbin">Harbin</a>, <a href="/en/Dalian" title="Dalian">Dalian</a>, <a href="/en/Sanya" title="Sanya">Sanya</a>, <a href="/en/Chongqing" title="Chongqing">Chongqing</a>, <a href="/en/Chengdu" title="Chengdu">Chengdu</a>, and <a href="/en/Wuxi" title="Wuxi">Wuxi</a>.  They also operate to a number of other smaller (often military) airports that lack civilian service on major airlines.  This includes places such as Datong and Foshan.  A shuttle bus to the Nanyuan Airport leaves Xidan Aviation Building (è¥¿å •æ°‘èˆªå¤§åŽ¦ <i>XÄ«dÄ n MÃ­nhÃ¡ng DÃ shÃ </i>) at 6:10AM, 7:00AM, 9:00AM, 11:00AM, 1:00PM, 2:00PM, 3:00PM. The first bus (6:10AM) might not be available every day. Be sure not to take a shuttle bus to Beijing Capital Airport. Check the shuttle bus direction written on it in Chinese. The bus ticket price is Â¥16.  A taxi should take around 45 minutes from central Beijing, and cost around Â¥60.

Beijing has many railway stations. Most trains arrive at the central, West, South or North stations.
Since the Olympics in 2008, foreigners are allowed to rent vehicles while in China.
Beijing is the hub of several expressways heading in all directions.  The following is a list of the expressways and their destinations:
11 China National Highways (å›½é “ <i>GuÃ³dÃ o</i>) also link into Beijing:
Long-distance buses from areas as far as Shanghai and the Mongolian border connect to Beijing.  You can reach areas as far as <a href="/en/Harbin" title="Harbin">Harbin</a> or <a href="/en/Xi%27an" title="Xi'an" class="mw-redirect">Xi'an</a> on a single bus ride.  Beijing has over 20 long distance bus stations, but what you need to do is go to the bus station located on the edge of the city in the direction you want to travel.
Most of the buses from the Long Distance Bus Stations will be regular or express buses, which take the expressways; cost from Â¥200-600 per trip, have comfy seats, and most rides do not take more than 6-12 hours, but sleeper buses are also available.
Sleeper buses, with bunk beds in rows, average about Â¥100 per trip, but many go <i>really</i> slowly up hills, avoid expressways, stop at every city or town, provide "meals" which you have to pay extra for, take the potholed National roads to save money, and a bus ride can take up to 24 hours.  The average speed is only 40 km/hr on the moderately fast sleeper buses, and the range could be from 25 to 60 km/hr.  It may be a good authentic taste of how less wealthy Chinese people travel.
Though some residents of Beijing know conversational English, especially in the areas frequented by tourists, popular office areas or Haidian District's university cluster, one should not count on finding a taxi driver or passer-by who knows English well.  Neither should a foreigner with minimal experience with the Chinese language put undue faith in his or her ability to pronounce Chinese place names so that a local can understand clearly.  Before embarking on a trip around the city, it is best to print out the names of places you want to visit in Chinese characters, or get your hotel front desk staff to write them out for you. When going to specific addresses writing nearby intersections or basic directions can be helpful as well. Show the text to the taxi driver, or just ask for help on the street.
Crossing the road in China can be intimidating for some travelers. Before crossing, assume that none of the road users will give way to you, even if a policeman is present. Cross at zebra crossings but keep your head on a swivel (just like you would anywhere else). Should you hear a loud horn when crossing the road, always look around as there is probably a car right behind you or heading straight for you. Should you find several cars and bicycles veering towards you from different directions, do not try to run to safety; instead, stand still. For drivers and cyclists a stationary obstacle is easier to avoid. Also note that traffic light crossings have zebra stripes painted on the road, but you should only cross when the walk light is green. As with pedestrian crossings in many countries, there is strength in numbers. When a mass of people crosses together cars are more likely to stop or slow down.
Taxis are the preferred choice for getting around, as they are convenient and are relatively inexpensive for travelers from developed countries (or from any country if traveling as a family). Downsides can be attempting to hail one during rush hours (when some drivers simply don't operate due to a hit on their profits) or suffering through traffic jams. Nearly all drivers do not speak English or recognize place names written in English, so it pays to have the Chinese characters for the location ready in advance. Some drivers may be reluctant to pick up foreigners, with some having bad experiences. If a taxi driver does pick you up, as one should wherever visiting, treat the driver with courtesy and you will likely not have any problems. Vehicles used as taxis are predominantly the Hyundai Elantra and some Sonatas, with Volkswagen Santanas and (older) Jettas and CitroÃ«ns making up the older fleet and less common. These taxis are dark red, or yellow top with dark blue bottom, or painted with new colors (see picture). A small percentage of models are painted all black. Luxurious black executive cars (usually Audis) can also be found, usually waiting outside hotels.
If a driver rolls down the car window to talk with you before allowing you to get in, they are trying to find out if your destination is the same as the way they are going (perhaps to re-fuel, swap the car with the other operator of the car, to grab a meal). If you get in the taxi and close the door and the driver refuses your destination, it could also be because traffic is busy towards that direction and the driver is not interested. However, if once the flag falls, that means the driver is legally obligated to take you to your destination. Do not be put off if the driver refuses to go to your destination; be put off if they refuse after the flag has dropped. Some travelers who know the area or language better may be able to set up a negotiated fare with the driver, but by and large, drivers will use the meter and passengers should accept any risks for not doing so.
Do not waste your time on taxis parked near the high traffic locations, near subway stations and near hotels. They either won't take you at all, or will refuse to use meter and the asked fare would be a rip-off (it is not unusual to be asked Â¥100 for a ride which is metered at Â¥30). Just walk extra fifty meters and take the moving empty taxi.
In the more remote places of Beijing, you might not be able to find any official taxis.  However, in these places there will most likely be plenty of unofficial taxis.  These might be difficult to recognize for travelers, but the drivers will address you if you look like you are searching for a taxi. Remember to negotiate the fare before you go and accept any risks that may accompany such a decision (inflated fare, lack of insurance in the instance of an accident, or worse).  Local people usually pay a bit less for the unofficial taxis than for the official ones, but the asking price for travelers will often be much higher (if going to a popular location it is not uncommon for an unregistered driver to ask for a higher price due to few if any travelers taking their unlicensed taxi; in essence, you may be paying for their return trip to an area of town where unlicensed drivers are more commonly found).  Also be aware that while China has low rates of violent crime, unofficial taxis are less safe - there are some reports of theft and assaults.
Taxis charge a starting fee of Â¥13, and an additional Â¥2.3/km after the first 3 kilometre. As of June 2013, the latest policy was Â¥1 fuel tax added to the total for all rides -- regardless of distance. This surcharge will be reflected on the meter once the driver raises the flag. Taxi meters keep running when the speed is slower than 12 km/hr or when waiting for green lights; 5 min of waiting time equals 1 km running.  Outside of rush hour, an average trip through the city costs around Â¥20-30, and a cross-town journey about Â¥50 (for example, from the city center to the northern side of the Fourth Ring Road).
If the taxi driver takes the toll road, you may also be asked to pay the toll charges which are typically Â¥5 or Â¥10. Typically drivers ask if you want to take a toll road if there is an alternative road (typically with much more traffic), but if there is no alternative, such as the Airport Expressway, the driver won't ask you in advance. Just gesture the driver to pass the receipt to you while passing the toll booth if you see the driver passing the payment to the operator.
If the taxi driver "forgets" to switch the taxi meter on, remind him by politely asking them to run the meter and gesturing at the meter box (è¯·æ‰“è¡¨ <i>qÇ ng dÇŽbiÇŽo</i>), though most can understand "meter please", and all can understand a simple point at the meter.   At the end, it is a good idea to ask for a <b>receipt</b> (å ‘ç¥¨ <i>fÄ piÃ o</i>) also while gesturing to the meter and making a writing motion. Having a receipt is handy in case you want to make a complaint later or for business reimbursement purposes, and since the receipt has the cab number, you stand a greater chance of getting your possessions back if you forget anything in the taxi.
If you want a tour around Beijing and its vicinities, you can ask your hotel to hire a cab for one day or several days. It usually costs Â¥400-600 per day, depending on where you go. You can also ask just about any driver to perform this service as most are more than willing to do so. If you have Chinese-speaking assistance, then bargain down the cost. No matter the cost, the taxi is yours for the day and will wait for you at various destinations.
During times of rain, hailing a taxi is more difficult due to extreme demand. Most of them refuse to take passengers and, besides, many will try to rise their fares. Although it seems unreasonable (triple to five times the normal fare), sometimes it is better to take their offers than to wait for another cab.
All official taxis have license plates beginning with the letter "B" which is reserved for public transportation vehicles, as in "äº¬B".  "Black cabs" may look like taxis but their license plates will start with letters other than B.  It's nearly impossible to hail a black cab on the streets; they generally hang out around tourist sights like the Great Wall and the Summer Palace or around subway stops.  Black cabs will charge you a higher fee for the journey, unless you are a good bargainer, know where you are going, and know what the right fare should be.  Sometimes they drop foreign tourists in wrong places. In some extreme cases, the driver may even take them to the countryside and rob them. If you find you hired a fake taxi and are overcharged, don't argue if you are alone, pay the driver and remember the car's license plate number, then call police later.
To avoid being taken advantage of, it is a good idea to know the rough direction, cost, and distance of your destination. You can easily find this out from asking locals or your hotel receptionist before calling a cab. Verify these values with the taxicab driver to show them that you are in the know, and are probably too much trouble to cheat. Keep track of the direction of travel with a compass and/or the sun. If the cab goes in the wrong direction for a long distance, verify the location with the taxi driver. For scamming drivers, that is usually enough for them to go back on the right track (without ever acknowledging that they were trying to cheat you). Honest drivers will explain why they are going that way. In addition, sometimes a cab driver might tell you an extravagant price to get somewhere and tell you the meter is broken.
There are several "makeshift taxis" running around Beijing including a seat fixed up to the back of an electric scooter. These guys will scam you big time if you don't negotiate a clear fare beforehand. Upon arriving your destination, for a 2 minute ride, the driver will demand an exorbitant amount and will be very belligerent if you don't pay it.
Keep in mind that central Beijing can be off limits at certain times, forcing cabs to reroute. And some roads forbid left turns (with big road signs) either at certain hours or all the time, so the driver might make a detour.
<b>A note on maps</b><br />
Beijing is changing at such a phenomenal pace that it isn't at all unusual for maps to be out of date by the time they are printed. Check tourist shops, subway stations, hotels, etc. for city maps and try to find the latest edition possible to avoid possible headaches in getting to your destination.
The <b>Beijing Subway</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://bjsubway.com/">[5]</a> is a good way to quickly get around the city and is clearly marked in English for travelers. At Â¥2 per trip (unlimited transfers), it is perhaps the nicest and cheapest subway system in the world. The network has expanded at a furious pace in recent years, with 15 lines currently operating, another four to open by 2015 (some in early 2014), and six additional lines by 2016 (totaling 23 lines and 900+ kilometers).  However, be warned that during rush hour trains can be extremely crowded.  The subway system shuts down quite early (around 22:30), and opens again around 05:00.
The lines are as following:-
<b>Line 1</b> runs east-west from Sihui East to Pingguoyuan crossing the political heart of the city along Chang'an Avenue, passing the Forbidden City, Tian'anmen Square and Wangfujing.
<b>Line 2</b> is a loop line following the old city walls. The first and last trains start/end at Xizhimen and the line serves Lama Temple, Beijing Railway Station and Dongzhimen (terminus of Airport Express).
<b>Line 4</b> runs north-south and serves Beihai Park, Peking University and Beijing South Station.
<b>Line 5</b> runs north-south to the east of Line 4. It has stations in close proximity to the Olympic Park in the north and Temple of Heaven in the south.
<b>Line 6</b> runs west-east to the north of Line 1 and to the south of the upper half circle of Line 2. It connects to Line 10, Line 5, Line 2, Line 9, and Line 4 on the way.
<b>Line 8</b> is a short branch line running from Beitucheng (on Line 10) and serves the Olympic Stadium. Eventually the line will connect to Line 2 at Gulou Dajie.
<b>Line 9</b> is a short line serving Fengtai District (including Beijing West Railway Station). Currently Line 9 is not connected to Line 1 at Military Museum station currently and does not stop at that station either but connects to Line 4 via The National Library Station, Line 9 at Baishiqiao South and Line 10 at Liuliqiao.
<b>Line 10</b> runs in another loop line around the city and is useful to reach the Olympic Stadium (with a transfer to Line 8 at Beitucheng), one of the city's embassy districts (Liangmaqiao) and Taiguli (the Village, also called "Sanlitun"). As of 2013 the line has almost completed the O, only missing one more bend in the southwest. It will be the second circle line in the Beijing Subway System when completed after Line 2. The line more or less follows the Third Ring Road. Line 10 connects to every single numbered line in the system including the Airport Express excluding Line 15.
<b>Line 13</b> is a largely above-ground line serving connecting to the northern section of the city, including Changping District. The line starts at Xizhimen and ends at Dongzhimen and forms a large arc. Connects to Line 5 at Lishui Bridge Station.
<b>Line 14</b> is not completed yet with the first section which opened in May 2013. Currently it has seven stations and runs from Zhangguozhuang in the southwest of the city to Xiju on the western part. 29 more stations are planned to be opened by 2015. 
<b>Line 15</b> is still partially in construction but as of 2013 runs through the Wangjing CBD and eastward to Shunyi District. Currently Line 13 is the only line which connects with the line, although Lines 8 and 14 will do so in the future. It is slated for completion before 2015 and will run east-west north of Line 10.
<b>Batong, Yizuang, Changping, Daxing and Fangshan lines</b> connect the outer suburbs to the city and are of little use for tourists.
Transfers between lines are permitted with the exception of the Airport Express, for which a separate ticket is required.
Subway station entrances are identified by a large blue stylized letter G wrapped around a smaller letter B. Single tickets cost Â¥2 and are only valid on the same day from the station they were purchased. Single-journey ticket machines are very simple to use; just press the numbers along the left side of the screen to choose how many tickets you want to buy, insert cash into the machine and press the green button then collect the ticket and change. The machine does not accept Â¥1 bills but if you pay with a Â¥10 or Â¥20 bill you will be given a handful of coins which you can use for future journeys. You must pass your ticket through the turnstiles upon entering and exiting the station, so make sure you don't lose it.
If you plan on using the subway a lot, pick up a <i>YÄ«kÄ tÅ ng</i> (ä¸€å ¡é€š ) <b>pre-paid card</b>, which has a Â¥20 refundable deposit.  Swipe the card at the entrance turnstile and again upon exiting. The use of the pre-paid card does not reduce the subway fare although it does dramatically reduce bus fares, by 60%. The card's deposit can only be returned at a few stations, so passing it on to a friend may be easier than getting your deposit back. Stations that offer a refund clearly state "Yikatong refund" in the ticket booth; examples include Xizhimen and Haidianhuangzhuang (only near exits c/d).
If you are carrying luggage you must pass through the X-ray checks at the stations. During morning and evening rush hours the stations and trains become very crowded - particularly try to avoid Lines 1 &amp; 2 as the old 1970s stations with their narrow passageways and open-edged platforms are not designed for the large numbers of passengers seen today.
When you buy your ticket be careful not to buy multiple tickets. A ticket is only valid from the station you bought it, on the day you bought it.
Beijing's bus system is cheap, convenient and covers the entire cityâ€”perfect for locals but, alas, difficult to use if you do not understand Chinese or Mandarin. The bus staffs speak little English, and only a few bus lines in the city center broadcast stop names in English. Bus stop signs are also entirely in Chinese.  But should you speak Mandarin, have a healthy sense of adventure, and a fair bit of patience, a bus can get you almost anywhere, and often somewhere that you never intended to go.  It is a great way to see parts of the city that tourists normally do not visit.
Most bus fares are around Â¥1, and if you get a public transportation card from a subway station (a card that acts as a debit card for the subway and buses) you can get a 60% discount on all bus fares.
Many buses feature air-conditioning (heating in winter), TVs, a scrolling screen that displays stops in Chinese, and a broadcast system that announces stops.  If you are having problems navigating the bus system, call the English-speaking operators at the Beijing Public Transportation Customer Helpline (96166).
<b>Warning:</b> Beijing buses can get very crowded so be prepared and keep an eye on your valuables. Indeed, the overhead speakers on more modern buses will announce a warning to this effect on the more crowded lines. Pickpockets tag along on buses and subways, so carry backpacks in the front, and try to put your valuables somewhere hard to access.  Be aware of a <a href="#Stay_safe">scam</a> offering bus rides to the Great Wall masquerading as the real bus service.  Instead of directly driving to the Great Wall, you will instead be led to a series of tours to dilapidated theme parks, shops, museums, and other tourist traps before finally reaching the Great Wall near the end of the day.
Bus lines are numbered from 1-999. Buses under 300 serve the city center. Buses 300 and up run between the city center and more distant areas (such as beyond the Third Ring Road).  Buses in the 900s connect Beijing with its "rural" districts (i.e., Changping, Yanqing, Shunyi, etc).
Full maps of the system are available only in Chinese. The <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.bjbus.com">Beijing Public Transport Co.</a> website has information in English, but both the Chinese version and English Versions have a very helpful routing service with an interactive map.  You can input your starting point and your ending point and see all the bus routes that will get you from A to B, look up a bus route by number, or input a place name and see all the routes that go stop there. Alternative places to look for bus routes are Google maps, Baidu, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://beijing.edushi.com/">Edushi</a> (click the bus flash icon) or <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://bus.mapbar.com/beijing/xianlu/5lu/">Mapbar</a>.
Most buses with a line number under 200 run daily 05:00-23:00. Buses with a line number greater than 300 run 06:00-22:00. All buses with a line number in the 200s are night buses. Many routes get very crowded during rush hours (06:30-09:00 and 16:00-20:00). On major holidays, there will be more frequent service on most city routes.
For passengers paying by cash: Lines 1-199 operate on a flat rate of Â¥1 per journey. Lines 300-899 charge Â¥1 for the first 12 km of each journey and Â¥0.5 for each additional 5 km.  Buses with air-conditioning (800-899) start at Â¥2.  The night buses (200-299) charge Â¥2 per journey.  Lines 900-999 charge according to the distance.
For passengers paying by the new pre-paid Smart Card: Lines 1-499 operate on a flat rate of Â¥0.40 per journey. Lines 500-899 get 60% off the cash price. There are also 3-day, 7-day and 15-day passes available for travellers. There is no return ticket or day ticket.
Once known as a nation of bicycles, China today has an ever growing number of private car owners. It is estimated 1,200 more cars hit the streets in Beijing every day. As a result, nowadays you are guaranteed to see more bikes in the Netherlands than in Beijing. However, the infrastructure from its days as capital of the "Bicycle Kingdom" means exploring Beijing on a bike is excellent. The city is flat as a pancake and all major streets have bike lanes. Bicycling is often faster than traveling by car, taxi or bus because of the traffic congestion in the motorized traffic lanes.
Four-wheeled motorized traffic in Beijing usually observes traffic signals with the exception of making turns at red lights which is often done without slowing or deferring to pedestrians or bicyclists. Pedestrians, bicycles and all other vehicles (for example, motorized bicycles, mopeds and tricycles) generally do not observe traffic signals. Also, cars, trucks and buses do not defer to cyclists on the road so it is common for a vehicle to make a right turn from an inside lane across a bike lane with no concern for cyclists traveling in the bike lane. Sometimes a right-turning vehicle crossing a bike lane will sound its horn as a warning, but not always. Cyclists also need to be on the lookout for wrong-way traffic in the bike lanes, usually bicycles and tricycles but sometimes motor vehicles, too. Wrong-way traffic usually stays close to the curb so you move to the left to get by them, but not always. Bicycling Beijingers tend not to wear helmets, nor do they use lights at night. Few bikes even have rear reflectors. The moderate pace and sheer numbers of bicyclists in Beijing appears to make bike travel safer than it would be otherwise.
While you will see cyclists use many creative paths across wide, busy intersections in Beijing, the safest way for cyclists is to observe the traffic signals (there are often special signals for cyclists) and to make left turns in two steps as a pedestrian would. But if you spend any significant amount of time cycling in Beijing, you will probably start adopting more creative approaches. These can be learned by finding a local cyclist going your way and following him or her across the intersection.
Several professional bike rental companies, as well as major hotels and some hostels, rent bikes on an hourly basis. For those who need the security of a guide, a bike touring company like <b>Bicycle Kingdom Rentals &amp; Tours</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://bicyclekingdom.com/">[6]</a> or <b>Chihaner Adventures</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.chihaner.com/bencandy.php?fid=75&amp;aid=702">[7]</a> or <b>Beijing Bicycle Tour</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://theme.hobobe.com/Beijing_Bicycle_Tour/index.html">[8]</a> would be a great way to go.
If you are staying more than a few days a reasonable bike can be bought for Â¥200.  Ensure that you have a good lock included in the price. The cheapest bikes are not worth the additional savings as you will get what you pay for.  The cheapest bikes will start to deteriorate as soon as you begin to ride, so spend a little more and get a bike in the Â¥300-400 range. Bike rentals may have good bikes, but you pay a high price and run the risk of the bike being stolen.
Minibuses are very common in the countryside outside the urban areas. Privately operated, most trips cost less than Â¥10 per short journey and only a little more for longer journeys.
Driving in Beijing can be quite complicated, language difficulties included, coupled with seemingly perpetual traffic jams. Many hotels, however, rent cars that come with drivers up to Â¥1,000 per day. Nevertheless, public transport will get you to most of the main tourist sites, and you should use them as your primary mode of transport.
You are not permitted to drive a car using the driver license issued by countries other than China. Even Hong Kong and Macau licenses are considered to be foreign and are not accepted. But for short visa holders (&lt; 3 months), it is possible to get a provisional driver's license at the PEK airport or the transportation police stations in the city in minutes. You need to provide your passport as well as your foreign driver's license, and do a small examination(just to confirm you don't have physical or visual disability that effect the driving security), then you can get the provisional driver's license in minutes. With this license, you can legally drive cars in China. Ask any information desk at the airport for the direction of applying such a provisional driver's license.
At the arrival hall(maybe domestic only) of T2, PEK airport, you can find the counters of many car rental companies, but their English is usually not good. You had better contact them in advance by phone.
Here is an incomplete list of car rental companies serving at the PEK airport:
The daily rate of smaller economic cars is about Â¥200-300. You need to deposit around Â¥3,000 (possible by using CUP/VISA/MasterCard credit card).

The centre of the city and most important landmark is <b>Tiananmen Square</b> in <a href="/en/Beijing/Dongcheng" title="Beijing/Dongcheng">Dongcheng District</a>.  This is the world's largest public square and a must see for all visitors from abroad and from elsewhere in China. The square is surrounded by grand buildings including the Great Hall of the People, the Museum of Chinese History, the Museum of the Chinese Revolution, the Qianmen Gate and the Forbidden City. It is also home to the Chairman Mao Memorial Hall and the Monument to the People's Martyrs and was also the site of the infamous massacre of student activists by the Peoples Liberation Army in 1989.
The <b>National Stadium</b> or <i>Bird's Nest</i> in <a href="/en/Beijing/Chaoyang" title="Beijing/Chaoyang">Chaoyang District</a> is a new major landmark and the symbol of the 2008 Olympic Games.  Two <b>contemporary buildings</b> in <a href="/en/Beijing/Chaoyang" title="Beijing/Chaoyang">Chaoyang District</a> are remarkable landmarks: the CCTV Building (sometimes called <i>The Underpants</i> or <i>Bird Legs</i> by locals) and the World Trade Center Tower III. Both are outstanding examples of contemporary architecture.
There are also a number of remarkable remains from the <b>medieval city</b> including the Ming Dynasty City Wall Site Park (the only remains of the city wall) in <a href="/en/Beijing/Chongwen" title="Beijing/Chongwen">Chongwen District</a>, the Drum and Bell Towers in <a href="/en/Beijing/Dongcheng" title="Beijing/Dongcheng">Dongcheng District</a>, and Qianmen in <a href="/en/Beijing/Chongwen" title="Beijing/Chongwen">Chongwen District</a>.
The city's many green oases are a wonderful break from walking along the never ending boulevards and narrow hutongs.  Locals similarly flock to Beijing's palaces, temples and parks whenever they have time.  The green areas are not only used for relaxing but also for sports, dancing, singing and general recreation.
The most important palace, bar none, is the <b>Forbidden City</b> (æ•…å®«å šç‰©é™¢) in <a href="/en/Beijing/Dongcheng" title="Beijing/Dongcheng">Dongcheng District</a>. The Forbidden City was home to the Imperial Court during the Ming and Qing Dynasties. Unlike many other historical sights, the Forbidden City was relatively untouched during the cultural revolution due to the timely intervention of premier Zhou Enlai, who sent a battalion of his troops to guard the palace from the over-zealous Red Guards. The <b>Temple of Heaven</b> (å¤©å ›) in <a href="/en/Beijing/Chongwen" title="Beijing/Chongwen">Chongwen District</a> is the symbol of Beijing and is surrounded by a lively park typically packed with hordes of local people drinking tea, practicing calligraphy or tai-chi or just watching the world go by.  The <b>Yonghegong (Lama Temple)</b> (é› å’Œå®«) in <a href="/en/Beijing/Dongcheng" title="Beijing/Dongcheng">Dongcheng District</a> is one of the most important and beautiful temples in the country.
Other parks are scattered around Beijing.  Some of the best are <b>Zhongshan Park</b> (ä¸­å±±å…¬å›­) in <a href="/en/Beijing/Xicheng" title="Beijing/Xicheng">Xicheng District</a>, <b>Beihai Park</b> (åŒ—æµ·å…¬å›­) in <a href="/en/Beijing/Xicheng" title="Beijing/Xicheng">Xicheng District</a>, <b>Chaoyang Park</b> (æœ é˜³å…¬å›­) in <a href="/en/Beijing/Chaoyang" title="Beijing/Chaoyang">Chaoyang District</a> and <b>Ritan Park</b> (æ—¥å ›å…¬å›­) in <a href="/en/Beijing/Chaoyang" title="Beijing/Chaoyang">Chaoyang District</a>.  The <b>Beijing Zoo</b> (åŒ—äº¬åŠ¨ç‰©å›­) in <a href="/en/Beijing/Xicheng" title="Beijing/Xicheng">Xicheng District</a> is famous for its traditional landscaping and giant pandas, however like many zoos, the conditions for the animals have been questioned.
<a href="/en/Beijing/Haidian" title="Beijing/Haidian">Haidian District</a> is home to the <b>Summer palace</b> (é¢ å’Œå›­), the ruins of the Old Summer Palace (åœ†æ˜Žå›­), <b>Fragrant Hills</b> (é¦™å±±), and the Beijing <b>Botanical Garden</b> (åŒ—äº¬æ¤ ç‰©å›­). All are quite close together and worth a visit.
The museums in Beijing are generally not yet up to the standard seen in cities such as Paris, Rome and New York. However the city contains one of the largest and most well known museums in Asia, the <b>Palace Museum</b> also known as the Forbidden City. It is also a <a href="/en/World_Heritage_Site#China" title="World Heritage Site" class="mw-redirect">UNESCO World Heritage Site</a>. China's government is determined to change the backward perception of its museums and has invested heavily in their development. It has also made most of them (not the Forbidden City) free to visit. However, for some museums tickets must be reserved three days in advance.
One of the most well-known museums in Beijing is the <b>National Museum</b> (å›½å®¶å šç‰©é¦†) in <a href="/en/Beijing/Dongcheng" title="Beijing/Dongcheng">Dongcheng District</a>, which was closed for renovation from 2007 to March 2011.  The <b>Military Museum</b> (å†›äº‹å šç‰©é¦†) in <a href="/en/Beijing/Haidian" title="Beijing/Haidian">Haidian District</a> has long been a favorite with domestic and foreign tourists.  The <b>Capital Museum</b> (é¦–éƒ½å šç‰©é¦†) in <a href="/en/Beijing/Xicheng" title="Beijing/Xicheng">Xicheng District</a> is a new high profile museum with historical and art exhibitions. The <b>China Aviation Museum</b> (ä¸­å›½æ°‘èˆªå šç‰©é¦†) located in the <a href="/en/Beijing/Northern_Suburbs" title="Beijing/Northern Suburbs">Beijing/Northern Suburbs</a> is surprisingly good and hosts 200+ rare and unique Chinese (mostly Russian) aircraft. Finally, a number of restored former residences of famous Beijingers, especially in <a href="/en/Beijing/Xicheng" title="Beijing/Xicheng">Xicheng District</a>, give a good insight into daily life in former times.
The <b>contemporary art scene</b> in Beijing is booming and a large number of artists exhibit and sell their art in galleries around the city. The galleries are concentrated in a number of art districts, including the oldest and easiest accessible, but also increasingly commercial and mainstream, Dashanzi Art District in <a href="/en/Beijing/Chaoyang" title="Beijing/Chaoyang">Chaoyang District</a>. (Bus Line 401 - departing from Dongzhimen or San Yuan Qiao)Other newer and perhaps more cutting edge art districts include Caochangdi in <a href="/en/Beijing/Chaoyang" title="Beijing/Chaoyang">Chaoyang District</a> and Songzhuan Artist's Village in <a href="/en/Beijing/Suburbs" title="Beijing/Suburbs" class="mw-redirect">Tongzhou District</a>.
The language of Beijing is Mandarin Chinese. Standard Mandarin itself was the administrative language of the Ming and Qing dynasties and was based mainly on the Beijing dialect. For language students this makes studying in Beijing an excellent chance to learn the language in a relatively pure form. That being said, Beijing dialect contains nasal "er" sounds at the end of many words. Hence the ubiquitous lamb kabobs (ç¾Šè‚‰ä¸² <i>yÃ¡ng rÃ²u chuÃ n</i>) become "<i>yÃ¡ng rÃ²u chuÃ nr</i>". In addition, the Beijing dialect consists of many local slangs which have not been incorporated into standard Mandarin. Beijing taxi drivers are famously chatty and will gladly engage students of the language offering excellent chances to practice the language and get a feel for the changes in the city and country from an "Old Beijinger".
English is spoken by staff at the main tourist attractions, as well as at major hotels. Otherwise, English speakers are not common, so always get your hotel's business card to show the taxi driver in case you get lost. Likewise, have staff at your hotel write down the names of any tourist attraction you plan to visit in Chinese, so locals can point you out in the right direction.

<b>National Centre for the Performing Arts</b> in <a href="/en/Beijing/Xicheng#Do" title="Beijing/Xicheng">Xicheng District</a> was finalised in 2007 and finally gave Beijing a modern theater complex covering opera, music and theater.  This is worth a visit even if you do not go to a performance.
The <b>Beijing Opera</b> is considered the most famous of all the traditional opera performed around China.  This kind of opera is nothing like western opera with costumes, singing style, music and spectator reactions being distinctly Chinese.  The plot is usually quite simple, so you might be able to understand some of what happens even if you do not understand the language.  Some of the best places to watch Beijing Opera are found in <a href="/en/Beijing/Xuanwu#Do" title="Beijing/Xuanwu">Xuanwu District</a> including Huguang Huguang Theatre and Lao She Teahouse.  There are also a number in <a href="/en/Beijing/Dongcheng#Do" title="Beijing/Dongcheng">Dongcheng District</a> including Chang'an Grand Theatre.
<b>Acrobatics shows</b> are also worth a visit if you want to see some traditional Chinese entertainment.  Some of the best shows are found in Tianqiao Acrobatics Theatre in <a href="/en/Beijing/Xuanwu#Do" title="Beijing/Xuanwu">Xuanwu District</a> and in Chaoyang Theatre in <a href="/en/Beijing/Chaoyang#Do" title="Beijing/Chaoyang">Chaoyang District</a>.
<b>Drama plays</b> has had a slow start in Beijing and is still not as widespread as you might expect for a city like Beijing, and you will most likely not be able to find many Western plays.  However, some good places for contemporary Chinese plays do exist including Capital Theatre in <a href="/en/Beijing/Dongcheng#Do" title="Beijing/Dongcheng">Dongcheng District</a> and Century Theater in <a href="/en/Beijing/Chaoyang#Do" title="Beijing/Chaoyang">Chaoyang District</a>.
<b>Classical music</b> has got a much stronger foothold in Beijing than drama plays.  Some of the best places to go are the National Centre for the Performing Arts and the Century Theater both mentioned above as well as Beijing Concert Hall in <a href="/en/Beijing/Xicheng#Do" title="Beijing/Xicheng">Xicheng District</a>.
Beijing is the center of higher learning in China. In fact, Peking University and Tsinghua University have been consistently ranked among the top universities in the world in recent times. As such it attracts the top talents from across China and is the destination for thousands of foreign scholars each year. Most of the universities are clustered in Haidian District in the northwestern part of the city. Nearly all of the universities in Beijing accept foreign students.  Most foreign students are on Chinese language programs which can last from a few weeks to a couple of years.  If you have a sufficient HSK level <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://hsk.org.cn/english/">[23]</a>  you can enroll in programs to study other subjects.
Most of the international business offices are in Chaoyang Distrct around Guomao, Dawang, Wangfujing and Chaoyangmen.  The <b>Central Business District</b> (CBD) is centered around Guomao.  Many technology companies have offices in Wangjing (sub-district in Chaoyang District) and Zhongguancun (Haidian District).
Like all of China, finding a job teaching English in Beijing is relatively easy for native speakers.  In fact, if you are of European descent some employers may assume that you are already qualified enough to teach English to Chinese students. However, more prestigious employers (especially universities and high-end language schools) will generally require an English teaching qualification and a Bachelor's degree (normally in any discipline, although sometimes specifically in English/linguistics). Reputable institutions will provide proper working visa category to ensure legal employment; those which do not are not advised.

Throughout nearly all markets in Beijing, <a href="/en/Haggling" title="Haggling" class="mw-redirect">haggling</a> is essential.  Especially when browsing through large, "touristy" shopping areas for common items, do not put it beneath your dignity to start bargaining at 15% of the vendor's initial asking price. In fact, in the most "touristy" markets final prices can often be as low as 15%-20% of the initial asking price, and "removing a zero" isn't a bad entry point in the bargaining process.  After spending some time haggling, never hesitate to threaten walking away, as this is often the quickest way to see a vendor lower his or her prices to a reasonable level. Buying in bulk or in groups may also lower the price. How high or low the vendor sets the asking price depends on the customer, the vendor, the product's popularity, and even the time of day. Vendors also tend to target visible minorities more, such as Caucasians or people of African descent.
The are a number of interesting <b>markets</b> around Beijing where you can find all kind of cheap (and often fake) stuff.  Some of the most popular places are Xizhimen in <a href="/en/Beijing/Xicheng#Buy" title="Beijing/Xicheng">Xicheng District</a>, Silk Street or Panjiayuan in <a href="/en/Beijing/Chaoyang#Buy" title="Beijing/Chaoyang">Chaoyang District</a> and Hong Qiao Market in <a href="/en/Beijing/Chongwen#Buy" title="Beijing/Chongwen">Chongwen District</a>.
As an alternative to the markets you can go to some of <b>the shopping areas</b> lined with shops.  This includes Nanluoguoxiang in <a href="/en/Beijing/Dongcheng#Buy" title="Beijing/Dongcheng">Dongcheng District</a> and Qianmen Dajie Pedestrian Street, Dashilan and Liulichang in <a href="/en/Beijing/Xuanwu#Buy" title="Beijing/Xuanwu">Xuanwu District</a>.
If you are looking for <b>traditional Chinese food shops</b> try Yinhehua Vegetarian in <a href="/en/Beijing/Dongcheng#Buy" title="Beijing/Dongcheng">Dongcheng District</a>, Daoxiangcun, Liubiju or The Tea Street in <a href="/en/Beijing/Xuanwu#Buy" title="Beijing/Xuanwu">Xuanwu District</a>. Please note that Chongwenmen Food Market in <a href="/en/Beijing/Chongwen#Buy" title="Beijing/Chongwen">Chongwen District</a> has been demolished in 2010.
Visiting <b>hotel shops and department stores</b> is not the most characterful shopping in China, but worth a look. While generally significantly more expensive, they are less likely to sell truly low quality goods. The old style of Chinese retailing is gradually being transformed by shops with a better design sense and souvenir items are getting better each year. Silk clothing, table settings and so on and other spots around town, are worth a look, as are porcelain, specialty tea and other traditional items.  Some of the most popular areas for this kind of shopping are Wangfujing and The Malls at Oriental Plaza both in <a href="/en/Beijing/Dongcheng#Buy" title="Beijing/Dongcheng">Dongcheng District</a> as well as Xidan in <a href="/en/Beijing/Xicheng#Buy" title="Beijing/Xicheng">Xicheng District</a>.

<b>Peking Roast Duck</b> is a famous Beijing specialty served at many restaurants, but there are quite a few restaurants dedicated to the art of roasting the perfect duck.  Expect to pay around Â¥40 per whole duck at budget-range establishments, and Â¥160-200 at high-end restaurants.  Beijing duck (åŒ—äº¬çƒ¤é¸­ <i>BÄ•ijÄ«ng kÄƒoyÄ </i>) is served with thin pancakes, plum sauce (ç”œé ¢é…± <i>tiÃ¡nmiÃ n jiÃ ng</i>)ï¼Œand slivers of scallions and cucumbers. You spread the sauce on the pancake, put a few pieces of duck, cucumber, and scallions.The end result is a mouthwatering combination of the cool crunchiness of the cucumber, the sharpness of the scallions, and the rich flavors of the duck.
The best way to eat well and cheaply in Beijing is to enter one of the ubiquitous restaurants where the locals are eating and pick a few different dishes from the menu. Truth be told, visitors can find Beijing a very inexpensive city for food, especially considering that tipping is not practiced in China (instead along with taxes, built into the menu price). Some of this is due to low wages for restaurant workers and farmers, use of genetically modified or engineered ingredients, or flavor enhancers or preservatives to help speed flavors along or quicken the cooking process.
Some of the cheapest and most delicious meals can be had on the streets.  <b>Savory pancakes</b> (ç…Žé¥¼æžœå­ <i>JiÄ nbÄ­ng guÅ zi</i>) are one of the most popular street snacks, eaten from morning till night with most carts operating during the morning commute and then opening again at night for the after-club crowds and night-owls. This is a Northern Chinese specialty. This delicious pancake is cooked with an egg on a griddle, a fried dough crisp is added, and the whole thing is drizzled in scallions and a savory sauce.  Hot sauce is optional. Not all street vendors are licensed and more than a fair share use recycled oil. For travelers unused to such and spending a few weeks in town may do well to avoid street vendors all together, or risk upset stomachs or worse. Diehard fans often go on a quest for the best cart in the city.  This  treat should only cost Â¥2.50, with an extra egg Â¥3. There are many styles, such as the egg is fried flat on top of the pancake and the toppings wrapped inside, or folded like a taco.
<b>Lamb kebabs</b> (ç¾Šè‚‰ä¸²å„¿ <i>yÃ¡ngrÃ²u chuÃ nr</i>) and other kebabs are grilled on makeshift stands all around Beijing, from the late afternoon to late at night. Wangfujing has a "snack street" selling such mundane fare like lamb, chicken, and beef as well as multiple styles of noodle dishes, such as Sichuan style rice noodles, but the brave can also sample silkworm, scorpion, and various organs all skewered on a stick and grilled to order.
A winter specialty, <b>candied haw berries</b> (å†°ç³–è‘«èŠ¦ <i>bÄ«ngtÃ¡ng hÃºlu</i>) are dipped in molten sugar which is left to harden in the cold and sold on a stick.  You can also find variations with oranges, grapes, strawberries, and bananas, or dipped in crumbled peanuts as well as sugar.  This sweet snack can also sometimes be found in the spring and the summer, but the haw berries are often from last season's crop.
The most famous street for food in Beijing is probably <b>Guijie</b> (ç°‹è¡—/é¬¼è¡— <i>GuÇ jiÄ“</i>), see <a href="/en/Beijing/Dongcheng" title="Beijing/Dongcheng">Dongcheng District</a> for further detail.
<b>Street food in Beijing</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://theme.hobobe.com/guijie/index.html">[49]</a> Gui Street (ç°‹è¡—) is located within Dongzhimen, East of the street from Second Ring Road of the Western part of the Dongzhimen overpass and West of the street from East Main Street eastern end crossing.
Gui Street now showcases many excellent cuisines, the centre of a food paradise. Stretching over one kilometer, 90% of the commercial shops in the street house more than 150 eateries. You can definitely find most of the larger restaurants in the capital here. Therefore Gui Street is known for its street food in Beijing.
<b>Quanjude (å…¨è šå¾·)</b> is the most famous restaurant for Peking Duck and is a national chain. Unlike McDonaldâ€™s, the quality, as well as price, among  different Quanjude restaurants differs greatly.  For quality and authentic Peking Duck, only two Quanjude restaurants should be patronized: one in Qianmen (å‰ é—¨) and one in Hepingmenï¼ˆå’Œå¹³é—¨ï¼‰.  Both of them are in central locations, providing the most authentic Peking duck dishes (and their prices are dearest too), but the former is right in the middle of tourist area and there is always a very long queue during lunch or dinner time.  The latter is just one subway station away from former with a much bigger capacity, and you will be guided to your seats in no time when you walk in.
Beijing is also known for its <b>mutton hotpot</b> (æ¶®ç¾Šè‚‰ <i>shuÃ n yÃ¡ng rÃ²u</i>), which originally came from the Manchu people and emphasizes mutton over other meats.  Like variations of hotpot (general name ç «é”… <i>huÅ guÅ </i>) from elsewhere in China and Japan, hotpot is a cook-it-yourself affair in a steaming pot in the center of the table.  Unlike Sichuan hotpot, mutton hotpot features a savory, non-spicy broth. If that's not exciting enough for you, you can also request a spicy broth (be aware that this is flaming red, filled with peppers, and not for the weak!). To play it safe and satisfy everyone, you can request a yuan-yang (é¸³é¸¯ <i>yuÄ nyÃ¡ng</i>) pot divided down the middle, with spicy broth on one side and regular broth on the other.  Raw ingredients are purchased by the plate, including other types of meat and seafood, vegetables, mushrooms, noodles, and tofu, so it's also perfectly possible to have <b>vegetarian hotpot</b>. A dipping sauce, usually sesame, is served as well; you can add chilis, garlic, cilantro, etc, to customize your own sauce. While "raw" sounds dangerous, boiling the meat yourself is the best way to ensure that more risky meats like pork are fully cooked and free of germs. In the city center, hotpot can run as much as Â¥40-50 per person, but on the outskirts it can be found for as little as Â¥10-25.  Low-budget types may reuse the spices or cooking broth from previous guests, although it has been boiling for several hours.
Beijing provides an ideal opportunity to sample food from all over the country. Some of Beijing's best restaurants serve food from <a href="/en/Sichuan" title="Sichuan">Sichuan</a>, <a href="/en/Hunan" title="Hunan">Hunan</a>, <a href="/en/Guangzhou" title="Guangzhou">Guangzhou</a>, <a href="/en/Tibet" title="Tibet">Tibet</a>, <a href="/en/Yunnan" title="Yunnan">Yunnan</a>, <a href="/en/Xinjiang" title="Xinjiang">Xinjiang</a>, and more.
For <b>vegetarians</b>, Beijing's first pure vegetarian buffet restaurant is located a Confucius Temple, see <a href="/en/Beijing/Dongcheng" title="Beijing/Dongcheng">Dongcheng District</a> for further detail.
Korean restaurants are also very common in Beijing, due in part by northern Chinese (males in particular) strong liking of meat. A frequent meal is the grill-it-yourself barbeque, including beef, mutton, chicken, and seafood items as well as some vegetables including greens and potatoes. Restaurants that serve abalone and sharkfin are considered the most expensive restaurants in the city. Expect to pay upwards of Â¥800 for a "cheap" meal at one of these restaurants, much more if splurging.
<b>Tea</b>, tea, and more tea!  Some shops are in malls and others are stand-alone establishments. Whatever their location, always ask the price before ordering or else brace yourself for the most expensive egg-sized cup of tea in the world. You can experience different styles of tea ceremonies and tea tastings at <b>tea houses</b> especially in the Qianmen area south of Tian'anmen Square.  These can range widely in quality and price. Some tea houses are really tourist traps whose main goal is to milk you of your money (See warning box). You can get a <i>free</i> tea demonstration at most Tenrenfu tea houses which are located throughout the city and at some malls. A private room or a quiet back table in a tea house with mid-range tea for two should cost Â¥100-200. After an afternoon in such shops the remaining tea is yours to take home. Once tea is ordered, the table is yours for as long as you like.
As a tea-loving country and grower of much of the world's tea, <b>coffee</b> is not as easy to find but a taste for it--along with more expats dotted throughout Beijing--has seen more emerging middle class and students drinking it. For example, the city alone has more than 100 Starbucks locations. Most are situated around shopping malls and in commercial districts of the city. Other international chains such as Costa Coffee and Lavazza also have locations around Beijing. Coffee of varying qualities is also available in the ubiquitous Taiwanese style coffee shops such as <b>Shangdao Coffee</b>. These are usually located on the second floor of buildings and often times offer Blue Mountain Coffee, making places like Starbucks seem a real bargain. Most coffee shops offer wireless. Baristas in non-chain coffee shops may not be educated on how to make generally accepted espresso drinks, like lattes and cappuccinos. Espressos, alone, usually taste better and are more consistent.
<b>Chinese beer</b> can be quite good and nearly all are lagers. The most preferred beer is Tsingtao (é ’å²› <i>QÄ«ngdÇŽo</i>) which can cost Â¥10-20 in a restaurant, or Â¥2-4, depending on size, from a street vendor, Beijing's homebrew is Yanjing (ç‡•äº¬ <i>YÃ njÄ«ng</i>), and has a dominating presence in the city (Yanjing being the city's name from its time 2,000 years ago as capital of the state of Yan).  Beer mostly comes in large bottles and has 3.1%-3.6 alcohol content. Both Yanjing and Tsingtao come in standard (æ™®é€š <i>pÇ”tÅ ng</i>) and pure (çº¯ç”Ÿ <i>chÃºnshÄ“ng</i>) varieties; the difference mainly seems to be price.  Beijing Beer (åŒ—äº¬å•¤é…’ <i>BÄ›ijÄ«ng PÃ­jiÇ”</i>ï¼‰is the probably the third most popular brand. Craft beers are also making an appearance in Beijing, with specialty beers found in various German-themed restaurants throughout the city and a growing number of foreign-style microbreweries, including Great Leap, Heping Brewpub, äº¬A (Jing A), Panda Brewery and Slow Boat.
Great Wall is the most popular local brand of grape <b>wine</b>.  Wine made in China does not have a great reputation, though this is changing. Giving wine as a gift is not a common custom in most places in China and most people will not be accustomed to wine etiquette or appreciation (white wine is often mixed with Sprite in clubs).  Imported red wines are usually of a better quality and can be found in big supermarkets, import good stores, and some restaurants.
The most common <b>hard liquor</b> is baijiu (ç™½é…’ <i>bÃ¡ijiÇ”</i>), made from distilled grain (usually sorghum) spirits. It comes in a variety of brands and generally for very cheap prices (Â¥8 for a small bottle) and should be avoided if you want to have a clear mind for your travels on the next day. The most famous local brand is called Erguotou (äºŒé”…å¤´ <i>ÃˆrguÅ tÃ³u</i>), which has 54% alcohol content. It should be noted that the local Erguotou is sold in gallon containers, often on the same shelf as water and with a similar price-range and indistinguishable colour. Care must be made not to confuse the two. Maotai (èŒ…å ° <i>MÃ¡otÃ¡i</i>), the national liquor, is one of the more expensive brands, and it used to cost about as much as an imported bottle of whiskey--but now it costs a lot more, from Â¥1,000 to well in excess of Â¥10,o00. Wuliangye (äº”ç²®æ¶²) is another high-end brands, costs around Â¥1,000. Due to its mild taste, Wuliangye might be a better option for first time baijiu drinker. A large selection of imported liquor can be found at most bars and big supermarkets. One should better buy expensive liquor (both domestic and imported) from big supermarkets in order to avoid fake ones.

Most of Beijing's bars are located in one of the bar clusters around the city.  A few years back, the only one was Sanlitun, but almost every year the last few years have seen a new area emerge.  The most important areas are:
<i>See the <a href="/en/Beijing#Districts" title="Beijing">Districts</a> articles for individual listings.</i>
Accommodation aplenty exists in the CBD, various embassy areas, universities and business parks. A few hotels are also located very close to the airport (one, Hilton Airport, is not connected but essentially in one of the airport parking lots).
Tour groups can, perhaps unsurprisingly, reserve rooms at high-quality hotels at rates far below those published. Hostels and western-style travel hotels are almost universally open to foreign guests. The lowest end Chinese accommodations - Zhaodaisuo (æ‹›å¾…æ‰€) - are generally inaccessible to the foreign community. However, for those determined to get a bargain, you <b>may</b> be able to get a room if you speak Mandarin. Many of the hostels are located in <a href="/en/Beijing/Dongcheng#Sleep" title="Beijing/Dongcheng">Dongcheng District</a> and <a href="/en/Beijing/Xuanwu#Sleep" title="Beijing/Xuanwu">Xuanwu District</a>. Discounted rates start around &#165;30 for dorms and just below &#165;200 for doubles in the cheapest hostels.
There are a large number of three and four star mid-range hotels throughout the city and in all districts.  The listed rates for these kind of hotels are often in the range of &#165;500-1,000 but you can often get a discount of around 50%.
Some 'expensive' hotels are in the city centre, especially in <a href="/en/Beijing/Dongcheng#Sleep" title="Beijing/Dongcheng">Dongcheng District</a> and on the eastern 3rd Ring Road in <a href="/en/Beijing/Chaoyang#Sleep" title="Beijing/Chaoyang">Chaoyang District</a>, however by Western standards these hotels are still relatively cheap.  In the outlying areas, especially out by the <a href="/en/Great_Wall_of_China" title="Great Wall of China">Great Wall</a>, are some country club type resorts as well as some unique, one-of-a-kind, hotels.  For the most expensive hotels, the listed rates start at around &#165;4,000, but are often discounted to a level around &#165;1,500.
Overall, Beijing is a very safe city. Violent crime is extremely rare, and it's not a problem to walk at night in urban areas. Beijing also enjoys the reputation of low crime rates in Asia and even the world.
Some petty crimes such as pickpockets should be cautious in the main shopping streets, tourist attractions and public transportations. Thieves are more active in the days before the Chinese New Year. Be very careful in those days.
Despite safe urban areas, some parts of Beijing's suburbs are not safe, because they concentrate almost all severe crimes of the city. They are called "Beijing's corner". Such as the middle western area of Fengtai, the western area of Shijingshan, the eastern frontier of Chaoyang, and the most parts of Daxing (except communities surrounding the metro route). Taxi drivers may refuse to take you to those places, and you should not go there indeed.
Tourists are often preyed upon by cheats and touts, who attempt to pull a number of <a href="/en/Common_scams" title="Common scams">scams</a> on tourists.  Be especially cautious in the inner city, around Tiananmen Square, and on the tourist-crowded routes to the Great Wall.
On the other hand, fears of scams have led many travelers to be overly dismissive of Chinese people who approach them. Many Chinese are tourists in their capital for the first time as well and they are genuinely curious about foreigners and may just want to practice their English and get a picture with you. Being asked to have your picture taken is very common and there are no known scams associated with this. Be friendly but don't feel pressured to go somewhere you hadn't planned on going in the first place. If you are outside the tourist areas then your chances of being scammed drop dramatically.
Chinese people are very friendly to travelers and foreigners in general; seeing through a scam requires the same common sense as travelling anywhere in the world. Beijing scams are not particularly innovative or brutal in world-wide comparison, and as long as you <i>keep your wallet out of sight</i>, you can always walk away without fear of violence or theft. That said, there are some common scams to be aware of.
Traffic can be crazy in Beijing, and reckless driving is fairly normal. Loud, persistent honking is commonplace. It is simply another way to indicate that the driver is there. Be prepared for drivers to violate traffic laws even to the extent of going in reverse on highways to back up to a missed exit or driving on a sidewalk. Also expect occasional road debris (a piece of wood or torn out tire) to be laying in the roadway. At night, be careful of missing manhole covers or road work taking place without warning or without proper illumination at night. Pedestrians should be very careful crossing the street people will generally stop for you, but they will honk. Keep an eye on the locals and cross with them â€” there is strength in numbers. Also note some construction trucks will abuse the speed limit and also are known to at times ignore traffic signals. Proceed when clear, not necessarily when the traffic light is green.

<b>Air pollution</b> has traditionally been a big problem in Beijing, and is typically ranked in the bottom 10 in domestic air quality rankings. Coal burning (used to generate majority of energy and heat), automobile exhaust, and dust storms from the Gobi desert combine to make some of the worst city air on the planet. Winter is the worst time as the cold air creates an inversion layer and traps the pollution in the city. A white surgical face mask may help with the occasional dust storms. A much higher-grade filter is needed to prevent 2.5mm particulates from entering the body. The government has implemented various measures to attempt to combat with the man-made and natural air quality issues. Beijing's water supplies are also commonly found to contain high levels of toxic substances.

Many available throughout the city which can post international mail.
Internet is highly restricted in China. Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube are completely blocked, and it is not uncommon for many foreign websites not to load. Examples of partially blocked sites include Wikipedia, Blogspot, and Tumblr. To circumvent this problem you can purchase a commercial VPN to tunnel out of the firewall. These can cost from free to ~Â¥120 per month. Be aware that free versions have security holes and can increase your chances of getting hacked.
Free WiFi can be found in all sorts of chain and independent cafes and fast food restaurants, and many sit-down restaurants as well. These cafes can look like restaurants from the outside, but most any place that is called a cafe will have Wifi. Wifi is also common in hostels and hotels. Faster connections may be available for a small fee.
Terminal 3 has a wireless network "Airport WiFi (FREE)". Passengers need to register for an account and then be granted five hours of use.
Laundry is inexpensive to be done in Beijing, as are some dry cleaning shops. Other dry cleaners near embassy areas or the CBD may be of higher quality, or simply of higher cost. If near Peking University, try Jingquan laundry service next to several dormitories in the southwest corner of the campus.
Long distance cyclist-tourists will find national road 109 is a pleasant way to enter or leave Beijing, though lots of work.  It immediately enters steep hills on the edge of the city, but sees little traffic, is well maintained and passes though lovely landscape of farmland and forests.  It's remarkable how close to Beijing you are, and how far it feels.
"2) Crossing the border by bus
Buses from Erlian to Zamyn-Uud leave from Erlian bus station on the corner of Chahaâ€™er Street and Youyi Lu near to the Mongolian Consulate. At the time of writing, there is a bus at 13:30 and at least one more later in the afternoon around 15:00. Taking the 13:30 bus should give you enough time to get on the 17:35 Zamyn-Uud to Ulaanbaatar train. This, however, is subject to tickets being available when you arrive in Zamyn-Uud, which, if you arrive in the afternoon, may be unlikely.
The process when taking the bus is pretty much the same as when taking the jeep, only since more people have to get off the bus, go through immigration, and get back on the bus again, it takes a little longer. That said, you should be able to get from Erlian to Zamyn-Uud in around two hours.
The price is Â¥40 plus the same Â¥5 exit tax."
Four hours by train or bus or two hours by car, visit the former imperial retreat of Chengde (256 km northeast of Beijing).
<b>Beijing</b> (åäº¬ <i>BÄijÄ«ng</i>) is the capital of the most populous country in the world, the <a href="/en/China" title="China">People's Republic of China</a>, and also its second largest city after <a href="/en/Shanghai" title="Shanghai">Shanghai</a>. It was also the seat of the Ming and Qing dynasty emperors until the formation of a republic in 1911. Beijing is the political, educational and cultural centre of the country and as such it is rich in historical sites and important government and cultural institutions.
The city is well known for its flatness and regular construction. There are only three hills to be found in the city limits (in Jingshan Park to the north of the famous Forbidden City). Like the configuration of the Forbidden City, Beijing has concentric "ring roads", which are actually rectangular, that go around the metropolis.
Beijing was host to the 2008 Summer Olympic Games.
Beijing has a total of 14 districts and 2 counties. In 2010, Xuanwu District was merged into Xicheng, and Chongwen District was merged into Dongcheng. Wikitravel continues to use the old districts. And according to the old districts, there are 8 urban districts, 6 rural districts and 2 counties(PolyU).
.
The four central districts are located within or just beyond Second Ring Road and make-up the old walled city of yesteryear.  Along with Chaoyang District (a massively-sized district larger than the four central districts combined), this is where most visitors will find an overwhelming majority of the sights and lodging, dining and entertainment options.  The districts are:
Other than Chaoyang and the southeast corner of Haidian, the following districts are not as popular for visitors (save for when going to visit the Great Wall, however, which for most visitors is the only location which would required a jaunt outside of the more densely-packed districts).  The districts are:
The remaining ten districts and counties are quite far from the centre.
Beijing literally means <i>Northern Capital</i>, a role it has played many times in China's long history.  Beijing's history dates back several thousand years but it first became notable in Chinese history after it was made the capital of the State of Yan under the name <i>Yanjing</i>. Yan was one of the major kingdoms of the Warring States Period, some 2,000 years ago.  After the fall of Yan, during the later Han and Tang dynasties, the Beijing-area was a major prefecture of northern China.
In 938, Beijing<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.map-china.com/beijing-local.shtml.htm">[1]</a> was conquered by the Khitans and declared the capital of the Liao Dynasty. The Mongols seized the city in 1215. From 1264 Beijing served as the capital of a united China under Kublai Khan. His victorious Mongol forces renamed the city, <i>Great Capital</i> (å¤§é½). From there, Kublai and his decedents ruled their empire from a northern location closer to the Mongol homelands. During this period, the walled city was enlarged and many palaces and temples were built.
After the fall of the Mongol-founded Yuan dynasty in 1368, the capital was initially moved to <a href="/en/Nanjing" title="Nanjing">Nanjing</a>. However, in 1403 the 3rd Ming emperor, Zhu Di, also known as Emperor Yongle, moved it back to Beijing and gave the city its present name. The Ming period was Beijing's <i>golden era.</i> The Forbidden City, the Temple of Heaven and many other Beijing landmarks were built in this period. The capital developed into a huge city becoming the religious and cultural center of Asia.
In 1644, the Manchus overthrew the declining Ming dynasty and established China's last imperial line - the Qing. Despite the changing political climate, Beijing remained the capital. The Manchu imperial family moved into the Forbidden City and remained there until 1911. The Qing built both the Summer Palace and Old Summer Palace. These served as summer retreats for the emperors and their entourages. During the 19th century, Western countries established foreign legations in the Qianmen area south of the Forbidden City. These came under siege during the Boxer Rebellion in 1900.
The Qing dynasty fell in 1911.  In the chaotic first years of Republican China, Beijing was beset by fighting warlords.  Following the Northern Expedition, the Kuomintang moved the capital to Nanjing in 1928, and renamed Beijing as <i>Beiping</i> ("Northern Peace") to emphasize that it was no longer a capital. Beijing remained a center for education and culture throughout the Republican Era. When the Kuomintang was  defeated by the Communists in 1949, the new government proclaimed a People's Republic with its capital at Beijing.

Beijing is characterised by its vastness and large distances between locations.  Until recently, the city was almost entirely made up of hutongs with narrow lanes and single story buildings.  Now, many of the hutongs have given way to broad boulevards and modern buildings, contributing to an airy, sprawling feel, in sharp contrast to cities like <a href="/en/Hong_Kong" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a> and <a href="/en/Shanghai" title="Shanghai">Shanghai</a>.
Beijing is the political centre of the country with official buildings and embassy areas dominating the city. Beijing is also the historical and cultural centre of China with many historical buildings and sites - especially within Ring Road Two.  The city has undergone rapid modernisation in recent years, with improvements of institutions, business environment and work conditions.
Given their city's historical, cultural and political heft, Beijingers are justifiably proud to be citizens of the capital. An attitude known as å¤§åäº¬ä¸»ä¹ or "Great Beijing-ism" is often used to describe their attitude toward people from other regions of China. They are often much more interested in politics and willing to talk about current events than people elsewhere in China. Beijingers also seem to focus on not losing face and often use humor in order to do so. However, many Chinese from other provinces find Beijingers very friendly and straightforward compared with people from Shanghai especially.
Beijing has a monsoon-influenced continental climate with hot, humid summers and cold, dry winters. The best time to visit is in September and October, during the "Golden Autumn" (éç§). Spring is the season for dust storms and is otherwise warm and dry. Summer can be oppressively hot and the tourist crowds tend to be the largest as well; prevailing winds from the south trap pollutants (mountains lie to the north and west), making summer the worst season for air quality. Winter is cold and dry with infrequent, but beautiful, snow. Temperatures can easily fall below â10 Â°C in winter and or just as readily rise above 35 Â°C in summer as well.
Beijing has a population of 17.55 million people (30% migrants) living on 16,800 km2 distributed in 18 districts.  The city borders Hebei Province to the north, west and south and Tianjin Municipality to the east.
<b>Scams at the airport</b><br />
<b>Arrival</b>: Using taxis other than those in the official taxi queue on ground level is not advised. The queue manager will help by pointing out the taxi you are to go to. Do not bother with impostors who pretend to work for the taxi company pose at the official-looking stands outside offering rides to the city (especially in the non-regular hours where there are not many people about). You will be led into a "taxi" with a fake meter (which could be out of sight) which runs very quickly (3-5 times the normal rate).  Read the <a href="#By_taxi">section on taxis</a> for details on how to distinguish between fake and legitimate taxis.
<b>Departure</b>: For some time, the airport construction/exit surcharge has been incorporated into the price of the airline ticket so simply ignore anyone attempting to con you into this. Your airline will be sure to inform you of any extra fees upon arriving at the counter!
<b>Beijing Capital International Airport</b> (åäº¬é¦é½å½éæºåº <i>BÄijÄ«ng ShÇudÅ« GuÃ³jÃ¬ JÄ«chÇng</i>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IATA" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:IATA">IATA</a>: <b>PEK</b>) <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://en.bcia.com.cn/">[2]</a> is located to the northeast of the central districts, 26 km from the city centre. The airport has three terminals, broadly speaking divided as follows:
Travel between Terminals 1 and 2 is via a long corridor with travelators. A fit person can make the route in about 10 minutes. A free shuttle bus runs between Terminal 2 and 3. It departs every ten minutes or so (every 30 minutes from 23:00-06:00), and the journey time is about 10 minutes. Terminal 3 is huge: it alone is bigger than all five of Heathrow (London)'s terminals. Additional time should be allocated when flying from here.  Minimum check in times vary, but generally close 30 minutes before departure for domestic flights, and 1 hour for international flight.
Facilities on arrival include ATMs and money changers. There also shared computer and wifi zone with power outlets to access Internet (need either to scan your ID/passport, or get a SMS code by phone). Be aware that upon departure, porters may want Â¥10 to wheel your bags 50 m to check-in and that most eating options are rather outrageously priced.  Before you cross through security, if you want a bite to eat in the Terminal 1, there is a KFC, and in Terminal 2, there are 2 KFCs, and the restaurants in the basement have relatively low prices compared to what's above. A meal at any of these places should be around Â¥20.
Many people use <b>taxicabs</b> to reach town from the airport. Try to get the Chinese name in characters of your hotel so that you can let your taxi driver read where you want to go. A taxi from the airport should cost Â¥70-120. You will have to pay the fee shown on the meter (make sure the driver uses it) plus Â¥10 toll for the airport expressway.  Traffic jams are common. If you are moving during night, taxis are your sole option as earliest arrival time at airport is 06:30 by public transport (taking first subway 05:30 depending on station and first Airport Express 06:00/Â¥25/~20-30min to T3 or T2)
The <b>Airport Express</b> train runs in a one-way loop from T3 to T2/T1, then Sanyuanqiao (transfer to subway Line 10) and Dongzhimen (Lines 2, 13).  A one-way fare is Â¥25, and the trip takes about 20 minutes from Dongzhimen to T3, 30 min to T2.   There is often a poorly formed queue to buy tickets although fast moving.
Please note, although the last <b>Airport Express</b> train leaves airport to city at around 23:00, the subway lines normally stop operating before 23:00.  You probably can not connect any subway line if you take a late <b>Airport Express</b> train and finding a legitimate taxi around the subway station during the night can be challenging.  Therefore, if your flight arrives Beijing airport after 22:30, you'd better to use other transportation instead.
Do not take the train just to get from T3 to T2/T1, as this will cost you the full Â¥25; use the free shuttle bus instead.  Trains are short, and not too frequent meaning that the trains are often very full with no space for luggage or anywhere to sit.  There are security checks before you get on the train, and include x-raying luggageâ¦.sadly, only small, waist high scanners are in operation, meaning you have to lift large and heavy bags, and shove them through.
A slightly cheaper way to get to the city centre is to take the <span class='vcard' id = 'airport_shuttle'><span class="fn org">airport shuttle</span> (<span class="nickname"><span class="non-latin">æºåºå·´å£«</span> JÄ«chÇng BÄshÃ¬</span>), <span class="tel"><abbr class="type" title="voice">â</abbr> <span class="phone value">+86 10 64594375 / 64594376</span></span>, <a class="url external autonumber" href="http://en.bcia.com.cn/traffic/airbus/index.shtml" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. <span class="hours">Buses for each route leave every 10-30 minutes</span>. <span class="description">There are several lines running to different locations throughout Beijing.

<br />
The cheapest (Â¥2) way would be to take public bus #359, which runs from the airport to Dongzhimen, where you can catch subway Line 2 or 13, but this is not very fast or convenient (1h + 10 min walk from airport).
A number of youth hostels and luxury hotels run their own complimentary shuttle buses services - ask the place where you are staying if they have one.
<b>Nanyuan Airport</b> (åèæºåº <i>NÃ¡nyuÃ n JÄ«chÇng</i>, IATA: <b>NAY</b>) is a former military airfield 17 km to the south of Beijing, currently used only by army-linked low-cost operator China United (ä¸­å½èå <i>ZhÅngguÃ³ LiÃ¡nhÃ©</i>) <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://cu-air.com/">[4]</a>.  China United runs flights (in cooperation with their owner China Eastern) flights to major cities including <a href="/en/Harbin" title="Harbin">Harbin</a>, <a href="/en/Dalian" title="Dalian">Dalian</a>, <a href="/en/Sanya" title="Sanya">Sanya</a>, <a href="/en/Chongqing" title="Chongqing">Chongqing</a>, <a href="/en/Chengdu" title="Chengdu">Chengdu</a>, and <a href="/en/Wuxi" title="Wuxi">Wuxi</a>.  They also operate to a number of other smaller (often military) airports that lack civilian service on major airlines.  This includes places such as Datong and Foshan.  A shuttle bus to the Nanyuan Airport leaves Xidan Aviation Building (è¥¿åæ°èªå¤§å¦ <i>XÄ«dÄn MÃ­nhÃ¡ng DÃ shÃ </i>) at 6:10AM, 7:00AM, 9:00AM, 11:00AM, 1:00PM, 2:00PM, 3:00PM. The first bus (6:10AM) might not be available every day. Be sure not to take a shuttle bus to Beijing Capital Airport. Check the shuttle bus direction written on it in Chinese. The bus ticket price is Â¥16.  A taxi should take around 45 minutes from central Beijing, and cost around Â¥60.

Beijing has many railway stations. Most trains arrive at the central, West, South or North stations.
Since the Olympics in 2008, foreigners are allowed to rent vehicles while in China.
Beijing is the hub of several expressways heading in all directions.  The following is a list of the expressways and their destinations:
11 China National Highways (å½é <i>GuÃ³dÃ o</i>) also link into Beijing:
Long-distance buses from areas as far as Shanghai and the Mongolian border connect to Beijing.  You can reach areas as far as <a href="/en/Harbin" title="Harbin">Harbin</a> or <a href="/en/Xi%27an" title="Xi'an" class="mw-redirect">Xi'an</a> on a single bus ride.  Beijing has over 20 long distance bus stations, but what you need to do is go to the bus station located on the edge of the city in the direction you want to travel.
Most of the buses from the Long Distance Bus Stations will be regular or express buses, which take the expressways; cost from Â¥200-600 per trip, have comfy seats, and most rides do not take more than 6-12 hours, but sleeper buses are also available.
Sleeper buses, with bunk beds in rows, average about Â¥100 per trip, but many go <i>really</i> slowly up hills, avoid expressways, stop at every city or town, provide "meals" which you have to pay extra for, take the potholed National roads to save money, and a bus ride can take up to 24 hours.  The average speed is only 40 km/hr on the moderately fast sleeper buses, and the range could be from 25 to 60 km/hr.  It may be a good authentic taste of how less wealthy Chinese people travel.
Though some residents of Beijing know conversational English, especially in the areas frequented by tourists, popular office areas or Haidian District's university cluster, one should not count on finding a taxi driver or passer-by who knows English well.  Neither should a foreigner with minimal experience with the Chinese language put undue faith in his or her ability to pronounce Chinese place names so that a local can understand clearly.  Before embarking on a trip around the city, it is best to print out the names of places you want to visit in Chinese characters, or get your hotel front desk staff to write them out for you. When going to specific addresses writing nearby intersections or basic directions can be helpful as well. Show the text to the taxi driver, or just ask for help on the street.
Crossing the road in China can be intimidating for some travelers. Before crossing, assume that none of the road users will give way to you, even if a policeman is present. Cross at zebra crossings but keep your head on a swivel (just like you would anywhere else). Should you hear a loud horn when crossing the road, always look around as there is probably a car right behind you or heading straight for you. Should you find several cars and bicycles veering towards you from different directions, do not try to run to safety; instead, stand still. For drivers and cyclists a stationary obstacle is easier to avoid. Also note that traffic light crossings have zebra stripes painted on the road, but you should only cross when the walk light is green. As with pedestrian crossings in many countries, there is strength in numbers. When a mass of people crosses together cars are more likely to stop or slow down.
Taxis are the preferred choice for getting around, as they are convenient and are relatively inexpensive for travelers from developed countries (or from any country if traveling as a family). Downsides can be attempting to hail one during rush hours (when some drivers simply don't operate due to a hit on their profits) or suffering through traffic jams. Nearly all drivers do not speak English or recognize place names written in English, so it pays to have the Chinese characters for the location ready in advance. Some drivers may be reluctant to pick up foreigners, with some having bad experiences. If a taxi driver does pick you up, as one should wherever visiting, treat the driver with courtesy and you will likely not have any problems. Vehicles used as taxis are predominantly the Hyundai Elantra and some Sonatas, with Volkswagen Santanas and (older) Jettas and CitroÃ«ns making up the older fleet and less common. These taxis are dark red, or yellow top with dark blue bottom, or painted with new colors (see picture). A small percentage of models are painted all black. Luxurious black executive cars (usually Audis) can also be found, usually waiting outside hotels.
If a driver rolls down the car window to talk with you before allowing you to get in, they are trying to find out if your destination is the same as the way they are going (perhaps to re-fuel, swap the car with the other operator of the car, to grab a meal). If you get in the taxi and close the door and the driver refuses your destination, it could also be because traffic is busy towards that direction and the driver is not interested. However, if once the flag falls, that means the driver is legally obligated to take you to your destination. Do not be put off if the driver refuses to go to your destination; be put off if they refuse after the flag has dropped. Some travelers who know the area or language better may be able to set up a negotiated fare with the driver, but by and large, drivers will use the meter and passengers should accept any risks for not doing so.
Do not waste your time on taxis parked near the high traffic locations, near subway stations and near hotels. They either won't take you at all, or will refuse to use meter and the asked fare would be a rip-off (it is not unusual to be asked Â¥100 for a ride which is metered at Â¥30). Just walk extra fifty meters and take the moving empty taxi.
In the more remote places of Beijing, you might not be able to find any official taxis.  However, in these places there will most likely be plenty of unofficial taxis.  These might be difficult to recognize for travelers, but the drivers will address you if you look like you are searching for a taxi. Remember to negotiate the fare before you go and accept any risks that may accompany such a decision (inflated fare, lack of insurance in the instance of an accident, or worse).  Local people usually pay a bit less for the unofficial taxis than for the official ones, but the asking price for travelers will often be much higher (if going to a popular location it is not uncommon for an unregistered driver to ask for a higher price due to few if any travelers taking their unlicensed taxi; in essence, you may be paying for their return trip to an area of town where unlicensed drivers are more commonly found).  Also be aware that while China has low rates of violent crime, unofficial taxis are less safe - there are some reports of theft and assaults.
Taxis charge a starting fee of Â¥13, and an additional Â¥2.3/km after the first 3 kilometre. As of June 2013, the latest policy was Â¥1 fuel tax added to the total for all rides -- regardless of distance. This surcharge will be reflected on the meter once the driver raises the flag. Taxi meters keep running when the speed is slower than 12 km/hr or when waiting for green lights; 5 min of waiting time equals 1 km running.  Outside of rush hour, an average trip through the city costs around Â¥20-30, and a cross-town journey about Â¥50 (for example, from the city center to the northern side of the Fourth Ring Road).
If the taxi driver takes the toll road, you may also be asked to pay the toll charges which are typically Â¥5 or Â¥10. Typically drivers ask if you want to take a toll road if there is an alternative road (typically with much more traffic), but if there is no alternative, such as the Airport Expressway, the driver won't ask you in advance. Just gesture the driver to pass the receipt to you while passing the toll booth if you see the driver passing the payment to the operator.
If the taxi driver "forgets" to switch the taxi meter on, remind him by politely asking them to run the meter and gesturing at the meter box (è¯·æè¡¨ <i>qÇng dÇbiÇo</i>), though most can understand "meter please", and all can understand a simple point at the meter.   At the end, it is a good idea to ask for a <b>receipt</b> (åç¥¨ <i>fÄ piÃ o</i>) also while gesturing to the meter and making a writing motion. Having a receipt is handy in case you want to make a complaint later or for business reimbursement purposes, and since the receipt has the cab number, you stand a greater chance of getting your possessions back if you forget anything in the taxi.
If you want a tour around Beijing and its vicinities, you can ask your hotel to hire a cab for one day or several days. It usually costs Â¥400-600 per day, depending on where you go. You can also ask just about any driver to perform this service as most are more than willing to do so. If you have Chinese-speaking assistance, then bargain down the cost. No matter the cost, the taxi is yours for the day and will wait for you at various destinations.
During times of rain, hailing a taxi is more difficult due to extreme demand. Most of them refuse to take passengers and, besides, many will try to rise their fares. Although it seems unreasonable (triple to five times the normal fare), sometimes it is better to take their offers than to wait for another cab.
All official taxis have license plates beginning with the letter "B" which is reserved for public transportation vehicles, as in "äº¬B".  "Black cabs" may look like taxis but their license plates will start with letters other than B.  It's nearly impossible to hail a black cab on the streets; they generally hang out around tourist sights like the Great Wall and the Summer Palace or around subway stops.  Black cabs will charge you a higher fee for the journey, unless you are a good bargainer, know where you are going, and know what the right fare should be.  Sometimes they drop foreign tourists in wrong places. In some extreme cases, the driver may even take them to the countryside and rob them. If you find you hired a fake taxi and are overcharged, don't argue if you are alone, pay the driver and remember the car's license plate number, then call police later.
To avoid being taken advantage of, it is a good idea to know the rough direction, cost, and distance of your destination. You can easily find this out from asking locals or your hotel receptionist before calling a cab. Verify these values with the taxicab driver to show them that you are in the know, and are probably too much trouble to cheat. Keep track of the direction of travel with a compass and/or the sun. If the cab goes in the wrong direction for a long distance, verify the location with the taxi driver. For scamming drivers, that is usually enough for them to go back on the right track (without ever acknowledging that they were trying to cheat you). Honest drivers will explain why they are going that way. In addition, sometimes a cab driver might tell you an extravagant price to get somewhere and tell you the meter is broken.
There are several "makeshift taxis" running around Beijing including a seat fixed up to the back of an electric scooter. These guys will scam you big time if you don't negotiate a clear fare beforehand. Upon arriving your destination, for a 2 minute ride, the driver will demand an exorbitant amount and will be very belligerent if you don't pay it.
Keep in mind that central Beijing can be off limits at certain times, forcing cabs to reroute. And some roads forbid left turns (with big road signs) either at certain hours or all the time, so the driver might make a detour.
<b>A note on maps</b><br />
Beijing is changing at such a phenomenal pace that it isn't at all unusual for maps to be out of date by the time they are printed. Check tourist shops, subway stations, hotels, etc. for city maps and try to find the latest edition possible to avoid possible headaches in getting to your destination.
The <b>Beijing Subway</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://bjsubway.com/">[5]</a> is a good way to quickly get around the city and is clearly marked in English for travelers. At Â¥2 per trip (unlimited transfers), it is perhaps the nicest and cheapest subway system in the world. The network has expanded at a furious pace in recent years, with 15 lines currently operating, another four to open by 2015 (some in early 2014), and six additional lines by 2016 (totaling 23 lines and 900+ kilometers).  However, be warned that during rush hour trains can be extremely crowded.  The subway system shuts down quite early (around 22:30), and opens again around 05:00.
The lines are as following:-
<b>Line 1</b> runs east-west from Sihui East to Pingguoyuan crossing the political heart of the city along Chang'an Avenue, passing the Forbidden City, Tian'anmen Square and Wangfujing.
<b>Line 2</b> is a loop line following the old city walls. The first and last trains start/end at Xizhimen and the line serves Lama Temple, Beijing Railway Station and Dongzhimen (terminus of Airport Express).
<b>Line 4</b> runs north-south and serves Beihai Park, Peking University and Beijing South Station.
<b>Line 5</b> runs north-south to the east of Line 4. It has stations in close proximity to the Olympic Park in the north and Temple of Heaven in the south.
<b>Line 6</b> runs west-east to the north of Line 1 and to the south of the upper half circle of Line 2. It connects to Line 10, Line 5, Line 2, Line 9, and Line 4 on the way.
<b>Line 8</b> is a short branch line running from Beitucheng (on Line 10) and serves the Olympic Stadium. Eventually the line will connect to Line 2 at Gulou Dajie.
<b>Line 9</b> is a short line serving Fengtai District (including Beijing West Railway Station). Currently Line 9 is not connected to Line 1 at Military Museum station currently and does not stop at that station either but connects to Line 4 via The National Library Station, Line 9 at Baishiqiao South and Line 10 at Liuliqiao.
<b>Line 10</b> runs in another loop line around the city and is useful to reach the Olympic Stadium (with a transfer to Line 8 at Beitucheng), one of the city's embassy districts (Liangmaqiao) and Taiguli (the Village, also called "Sanlitun"). As of 2013 the line has almost completed the O, only missing one more bend in the southwest. It will be the second circle line in the Beijing Subway System when completed after Line 2. The line more or less follows the Third Ring Road. Line 10 connects to every single numbered line in the system including the Airport Express excluding Line 15.
<b>Line 13</b> is a largely above-ground line serving connecting to the northern section of the city, including Changping District. The line starts at Xizhimen and ends at Dongzhimen and forms a large arc. Connects to Line 5 at Lishui Bridge Station.
<b>Line 14</b> is not completed yet with the first section which opened in May 2013. Currently it has seven stations and runs from Zhangguozhuang in the southwest of the city to Xiju on the western part. 29 more stations are planned to be opened by 2015. 
<b>Line 15</b> is still partially in construction but as of 2013 runs through the Wangjing CBD and eastward to Shunyi District. Currently Line 13 is the only line which connects with the line, although Lines 8 and 14 will do so in the future. It is slated for completion before 2015 and will run east-west north of Line 10.
<b>Batong, Yizuang, Changping, Daxing and Fangshan lines</b> connect the outer suburbs to the city and are of little use for tourists.
Transfers between lines are permitted with the exception of the Airport Express, for which a separate ticket is required.
Subway station entrances are identified by a large blue stylized letter G wrapped around a smaller letter B. Single tickets cost Â¥2 and are only valid on the same day from the station they were purchased. Single-journey ticket machines are very simple to use; just press the numbers along the left side of the screen to choose how many tickets you want to buy, insert cash into the machine and press the green button then collect the ticket and change. The machine does not accept Â¥1 bills but if you pay with a Â¥10 or Â¥20 bill you will be given a handful of coins which you can use for future journeys. You must pass your ticket through the turnstiles upon entering and exiting the station, so make sure you don't lose it.
If you plan on using the subway a lot, pick up a <i>YÄ«kÄtÅng</i> (ä¸å¡é ) <b>pre-paid card</b>, which has a Â¥20 refundable deposit.  Swipe the card at the entrance turnstile and again upon exiting. The use of the pre-paid card does not reduce the subway fare although it does dramatically reduce bus fares, by 60%. The card's deposit can only be returned at a few stations, so passing it on to a friend may be easier than getting your deposit back. Stations that offer a refund clearly state "Yikatong refund" in the ticket booth; examples include Xizhimen and Haidianhuangzhuang (only near exits c/d).
If you are carrying luggage you must pass through the X-ray checks at the stations. During morning and evening rush hours the stations and trains become very crowded - particularly try to avoid Lines 1 &amp; 2 as the old 1970s stations with their narrow passageways and open-edged platforms are not designed for the large numbers of passengers seen today.
When you buy your ticket be careful not to buy multiple tickets. A ticket is only valid from the station you bought it, on the day you bought it.
Beijing's bus system is cheap, convenient and covers the entire cityâperfect for locals but, alas, difficult to use if you do not understand Chinese or Mandarin. The bus staffs speak little English, and only a few bus lines in the city center broadcast stop names in English. Bus stop signs are also entirely in Chinese.  But should you speak Mandarin, have a healthy sense of adventure, and a fair bit of patience, a bus can get you almost anywhere, and often somewhere that you never intended to go.  It is a great way to see parts of the city that tourists normally do not visit.
Most bus fares are around Â¥1, and if you get a public transportation card from a subway station (a card that acts as a debit card for the subway and buses) you can get a 60% discount on all bus fares.
Many buses feature air-conditioning (heating in winter), TVs, a scrolling screen that displays stops in Chinese, and a broadcast system that announces stops.  If you are having problems navigating the bus system, call the English-speaking operators at the Beijing Public Transportation Customer Helpline (96166).
<b>Warning:</b> Beijing buses can get very crowded so be prepared and keep an eye on your valuables. Indeed, the overhead speakers on more modern buses will announce a warning to this effect on the more crowded lines. Pickpockets tag along on buses and subways, so carry backpacks in the front, and try to put your valuables somewhere hard to access.  Be aware of a <a href="#Stay_safe">scam</a> offering bus rides to the Great Wall masquerading as the real bus service.  Instead of directly driving to the Great Wall, you will instead be led to a series of tours to dilapidated theme parks, shops, museums, and other tourist traps before finally reaching the Great Wall near the end of the day.
Bus lines are numbered from 1-999. Buses under 300 serve the city center. Buses 300 and up run between the city center and more distant areas (such as beyond the Third Ring Road).  Buses in the 900s connect Beijing with its "rural" districts (i.e., Changping, Yanqing, Shunyi, etc).
Full maps of the system are available only in Chinese. The <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.bjbus.com">Beijing Public Transport Co.</a> website has information in English, but both the Chinese version and English Versions have a very helpful routing service with an interactive map.  You can input your starting point and your ending point and see all the bus routes that will get you from A to B, look up a bus route by number, or input a place name and see all the routes that go stop there. Alternative places to look for bus routes are Google maps, Baidu, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://beijing.edushi.com/">Edushi</a> (click the bus flash icon) or <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://bus.mapbar.com/beijing/xianlu/5lu/">Mapbar</a>.
Most buses with a line number under 200 run daily 05:00-23:00. Buses with a line number greater than 300 run 06:00-22:00. All buses with a line number in the 200s are night buses. Many routes get very crowded during rush hours (06:30-09:00 and 16:00-20:00). On major holidays, there will be more frequent service on most city routes.
For passengers paying by cash: Lines 1-199 operate on a flat rate of Â¥1 per journey. Lines 300-899 charge Â¥1 for the first 12 km of each journey and Â¥0.5 for each additional 5 km.  Buses with air-conditioning (800-899) start at Â¥2.  The night buses (200-299) charge Â¥2 per journey.  Lines 900-999 charge according to the distance.
For passengers paying by the new pre-paid Smart Card: Lines 1-499 operate on a flat rate of Â¥0.40 per journey. Lines 500-899 get 60% off the cash price. There are also 3-day, 7-day and 15-day passes available for travellers. There is no return ticket or day ticket.
Once known as a nation of bicycles, China today has an ever growing number of private car owners. It is estimated 1,200 more cars hit the streets in Beijing every day. As a result, nowadays you are guaranteed to see more bikes in the Netherlands than in Beijing. However, the infrastructure from its days as capital of the "Bicycle Kingdom" means exploring Beijing on a bike is excellent. The city is flat as a pancake and all major streets have bike lanes. Bicycling is often faster than traveling by car, taxi or bus because of the traffic congestion in the motorized traffic lanes.
Four-wheeled motorized traffic in Beijing usually observes traffic signals with the exception of making turns at red lights which is often done without slowing or deferring to pedestrians or bicyclists. Pedestrians, bicycles and all other vehicles (for example, motorized bicycles, mopeds and tricycles) generally do not observe traffic signals. Also, cars, trucks and buses do not defer to cyclists on the road so it is common for a vehicle to make a right turn from an inside lane across a bike lane with no concern for cyclists traveling in the bike lane. Sometimes a right-turning vehicle crossing a bike lane will sound its horn as a warning, but not always. Cyclists also need to be on the lookout for wrong-way traffic in the bike lanes, usually bicycles and tricycles but sometimes motor vehicles, too. Wrong-way traffic usually stays close to the curb so you move to the left to get by them, but not always. Bicycling Beijingers tend not to wear helmets, nor do they use lights at night. Few bikes even have rear reflectors. The moderate pace and sheer numbers of bicyclists in Beijing appears to make bike travel safer than it would be otherwise.
While you will see cyclists use many creative paths across wide, busy intersections in Beijing, the safest way for cyclists is to observe the traffic signals (there are often special signals for cyclists) and to make left turns in two steps as a pedestrian would. But if you spend any significant amount of time cycling in Beijing, you will probably start adopting more creative approaches. These can be learned by finding a local cyclist going your way and following him or her across the intersection.
Several professional bike rental companies, as well as major hotels and some hostels, rent bikes on an hourly basis. For those who need the security of a guide, a bike touring company like <b>Bicycle Kingdom Rentals &amp; Tours</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://bicyclekingdom.com/">[6]</a> or <b>Chihaner Adventures</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.chihaner.com/bencandy.php?fid=75&amp;aid=702">[7]</a> or <b>Beijing Bicycle Tour</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://theme.hobobe.com/Beijing_Bicycle_Tour/index.html">[8]</a> would be a great way to go.
If you are staying more than a few days a reasonable bike can be bought for Â¥200.  Ensure that you have a good lock included in the price. The cheapest bikes are not worth the additional savings as you will get what you pay for.  The cheapest bikes will start to deteriorate as soon as you begin to ride, so spend a little more and get a bike in the Â¥300-400 range. Bike rentals may have good bikes, but you pay a high price and run the risk of the bike being stolen.
Minibuses are very common in the countryside outside the urban areas. Privately operated, most trips cost less than Â¥10 per short journey and only a little more for longer journeys.
Driving in Beijing can be quite complicated, language difficulties included, coupled with seemingly perpetual traffic jams. Many hotels, however, rent cars that come with drivers up to Â¥1,000 per day. Nevertheless, public transport will get you to most of the main tourist sites, and you should use them as your primary mode of transport.
You are not permitted to drive a car using the driver license issued by countries other than China. Even Hong Kong and Macau licenses are considered to be foreign and are not accepted. But for short visa holders (&lt; 3 months), it is possible to get a provisional driver's license at the PEK airport or the transportation police stations in the city in minutes. You need to provide your passport as well as your foreign driver's license, and do a small examination(just to confirm you don't have physical or visual disability that effect the driving security), then you can get the provisional driver's license in minutes. With this license, you can legally drive cars in China. Ask any information desk at the airport for the direction of applying such a provisional driver's license.
At the arrival hall(maybe domestic only) of T2, PEK airport, you can find the counters of many car rental companies, but their English is usually not good. You had better contact them in advance by phone.
Here is an incomplete list of car rental companies serving at the PEK airport:
The daily rate of smaller economic cars is about Â¥200-300. You need to deposit around Â¥3,000 (possible by using CUP/VISA/MasterCard credit card).

The centre of the city and most important landmark is <b>Tiananmen Square</b> in <a href="/en/Beijing/Dongcheng" title="Beijing/Dongcheng">Dongcheng District</a>.  This is the world's largest public square and a must see for all visitors from abroad and from elsewhere in China. The square is surrounded by grand buildings including the Great Hall of the People, the Museum of Chinese History, the Museum of the Chinese Revolution, the Qianmen Gate and the Forbidden City. It is also home to the Chairman Mao Memorial Hall and the Monument to the People's Martyrs and was also the site of the infamous massacre of student activists by the Peoples Liberation Army in 1989.
The <b>National Stadium</b> or <i>Bird's Nest</i> in <a href="/en/Beijing/Chaoyang" title="Beijing/Chaoyang">Chaoyang District</a> is a new major landmark and the symbol of the 2008 Olympic Games.  Two <b>contemporary buildings</b> in <a href="/en/Beijing/Chaoyang" title="Beijing/Chaoyang">Chaoyang District</a> are remarkable landmarks: the CCTV Building (sometimes called <i>The Underpants</i> or <i>Bird Legs</i> by locals) and the World Trade Center Tower III. Both are outstanding examples of contemporary architecture.
There are also a number of remarkable remains from the <b>medieval city</b> including the Ming Dynasty City Wall Site Park (the only remains of the city wall) in <a href="/en/Beijing/Chongwen" title="Beijing/Chongwen">Chongwen District</a>, the Drum and Bell Towers in <a href="/en/Beijing/Dongcheng" title="Beijing/Dongcheng">Dongcheng District</a>, and Qianmen in <a href="/en/Beijing/Chongwen" title="Beijing/Chongwen">Chongwen District</a>.
The city's many green oases are a wonderful break from walking along the never ending boulevards and narrow hutongs.  Locals similarly flock to Beijing's palaces, temples and parks whenever they have time.  The green areas are not only used for relaxing but also for sports, dancing, singing and general recreation.
The most important palace, bar none, is the <b>Forbidden City</b> (æå®«åç©é¢) in <a href="/en/Beijing/Dongcheng" title="Beijing/Dongcheng">Dongcheng District</a>. The Forbidden City was home to the Imperial Court during the Ming and Qing Dynasties. Unlike many other historical sights, the Forbidden City was relatively untouched during the cultural revolution due to the timely intervention of premier Zhou Enlai, who sent a battalion of his troops to guard the palace from the over-zealous Red Guards. The <b>Temple of Heaven</b> (å¤©å) in <a href="/en/Beijing/Chongwen" title="Beijing/Chongwen">Chongwen District</a> is the symbol of Beijing and is surrounded by a lively park typically packed with hordes of local people drinking tea, practicing calligraphy or tai-chi or just watching the world go by.  The <b>Yonghegong (Lama Temple)</b> (éåå®«) in <a href="/en/Beijing/Dongcheng" title="Beijing/Dongcheng">Dongcheng District</a> is one of the most important and beautiful temples in the country.
Other parks are scattered around Beijing.  Some of the best are <b>Zhongshan Park</b> (ä¸­å±±å¬å­) in <a href="/en/Beijing/Xicheng" title="Beijing/Xicheng">Xicheng District</a>, <b>Beihai Park</b> (åæµ·å¬å­) in <a href="/en/Beijing/Xicheng" title="Beijing/Xicheng">Xicheng District</a>, <b>Chaoyang Park</b> (æé³å¬å­) in <a href="/en/Beijing/Chaoyang" title="Beijing/Chaoyang">Chaoyang District</a> and <b>Ritan Park</b> (æ¥åå¬å­) in <a href="/en/Beijing/Chaoyang" title="Beijing/Chaoyang">Chaoyang District</a>.  The <b>Beijing Zoo</b> (åäº¬å¨ç©å­) in <a href="/en/Beijing/Xicheng" title="Beijing/Xicheng">Xicheng District</a> is famous for its traditional landscaping and giant pandas, however like many zoos, the conditions for the animals have been questioned.
<a href="/en/Beijing/Haidian" title="Beijing/Haidian">Haidian District</a> is home to the <b>Summer palace</b> (é¢åå­), the ruins of the Old Summer Palace (åæå­), <b>Fragrant Hills</b> (é¦å±±), and the Beijing <b>Botanical Garden</b> (åäº¬æ¤ç©å­). All are quite close together and worth a visit.
The museums in Beijing are generally not yet up to the standard seen in cities such as Paris, Rome and New York. However the city contains one of the largest and most well known museums in Asia, the <b>Palace Museum</b> also known as the Forbidden City. It is also a <a href="/en/World_Heritage_Site#China" title="World Heritage Site" class="mw-redirect">UNESCO World Heritage Site</a>. China's government is determined to change the backward perception of its museums and has invested heavily in their development. It has also made most of them (not the Forbidden City) free to visit. However, for some museums tickets must be reserved three days in advance.
One of the most well-known museums in Beijing is the <b>National Museum</b> (å½å®¶åç©é¦) in <a href="/en/Beijing/Dongcheng" title="Beijing/Dongcheng">Dongcheng District</a>, which was closed for renovation from 2007 to March 2011.  The <b>Military Museum</b> (åäºåç©é¦) in <a href="/en/Beijing/Haidian" title="Beijing/Haidian">Haidian District</a> has long been a favorite with domestic and foreign tourists.  The <b>Capital Museum</b> (é¦é½åç©é¦) in <a href="/en/Beijing/Xicheng" title="Beijing/Xicheng">Xicheng District</a> is a new high profile museum with historical and art exhibitions. The <b>China Aviation Museum</b> (ä¸­å½æ°èªåç©é¦) located in the <a href="/en/Beijing/Northern_Suburbs" title="Beijing/Northern Suburbs">Beijing/Northern Suburbs</a> is surprisingly good and hosts 200+ rare and unique Chinese (mostly Russian) aircraft. Finally, a number of restored former residences of famous Beijingers, especially in <a href="/en/Beijing/Xicheng" title="Beijing/Xicheng">Xicheng District</a>, give a good insight into daily life in former times.
The <b>contemporary art scene</b> in Beijing is booming and a large number of artists exhibit and sell their art in galleries around the city. The galleries are concentrated in a number of art districts, including the oldest and easiest accessible, but also increasingly commercial and mainstream, Dashanzi Art District in <a href="/en/Beijing/Chaoyang" title="Beijing/Chaoyang">Chaoyang District</a>. (Bus Line 401 - departing from Dongzhimen or San Yuan Qiao)Other newer and perhaps more cutting edge art districts include Caochangdi in <a href="/en/Beijing/Chaoyang" title="Beijing/Chaoyang">Chaoyang District</a> and Songzhuan Artist's Village in <a href="/en/Beijing/Suburbs" title="Beijing/Suburbs" class="mw-redirect">Tongzhou District</a>.
The language of Beijing is Mandarin Chinese. Standard Mandarin itself was the administrative language of the Ming and Qing dynasties and was based mainly on the Beijing dialect. For language students this makes studying in Beijing an excellent chance to learn the language in a relatively pure form. That being said, Beijing dialect contains nasal "er" sounds at the end of many words. Hence the ubiquitous lamb kabobs (ç¾èä¸² <i>yÃ¡ng rÃ²u chuÃ n</i>) become "<i>yÃ¡ng rÃ²u chuÃ nr</i>". In addition, the Beijing dialect consists of many local slangs which have not been incorporated into standard Mandarin. Beijing taxi drivers are famously chatty and will gladly engage students of the language offering excellent chances to practice the language and get a feel for the changes in the city and country from an "Old Beijinger".
English is spoken by staff at the main tourist attractions, as well as at major hotels. Otherwise, English speakers are not common, so always get your hotel's business card to show the taxi driver in case you get lost. Likewise, have staff at your hotel write down the names of any tourist attraction you plan to visit in Chinese, so locals can point you out in the right direction.

<b>National Centre for the Performing Arts</b> in <a href="/en/Beijing/Xicheng#Do" title="Beijing/Xicheng">Xicheng District</a> was finalised in 2007 and finally gave Beijing a modern theater complex covering opera, music and theater.  This is worth a visit even if you do not go to a performance.
The <b>Beijing Opera</b> is considered the most famous of all the traditional opera performed around China.  This kind of opera is nothing like western opera with costumes, singing style, music and spectator reactions being distinctly Chinese.  The plot is usually quite simple, so you might be able to understand some of what happens even if you do not understand the language.  Some of the best places to watch Beijing Opera are found in <a href="/en/Beijing/Xuanwu#Do" title="Beijing/Xuanwu">Xuanwu District</a> including Huguang Huguang Theatre and Lao She Teahouse.  There are also a number in <a href="/en/Beijing/Dongcheng#Do" title="Beijing/Dongcheng">Dongcheng District</a> including Chang'an Grand Theatre.
<b>Acrobatics shows</b> are also worth a visit if you want to see some traditional Chinese entertainment.  Some of the best shows are found in Tianqiao Acrobatics Theatre in <a href="/en/Beijing/Xuanwu#Do" title="Beijing/Xuanwu">Xuanwu District</a> and in Chaoyang Theatre in <a href="/en/Beijing/Chaoyang#Do" title="Beijing/Chaoyang">Chaoyang District</a>.
<b>Drama plays</b> has had a slow start in Beijing and is still not as widespread as you might expect for a city like Beijing, and you will most likely not be able to find many Western plays.  However, some good places for contemporary Chinese plays do exist including Capital Theatre in <a href="/en/Beijing/Dongcheng#Do" title="Beijing/Dongcheng">Dongcheng District</a> and Century Theater in <a href="/en/Beijing/Chaoyang#Do" title="Beijing/Chaoyang">Chaoyang District</a>.
<b>Classical music</b> has got a much stronger foothold in Beijing than drama plays.  Some of the best places to go are the National Centre for the Performing Arts and the Century Theater both mentioned above as well as Beijing Concert Hall in <a href="/en/Beijing/Xicheng#Do" title="Beijing/Xicheng">Xicheng District</a>.
Beijing is the center of higher learning in China. In fact, Peking University and Tsinghua University have been consistently ranked among the top universities in the world in recent times. As such it attracts the top talents from across China and is the destination for thousands of foreign scholars each year. Most of the universities are clustered in Haidian District in the northwestern part of the city. Nearly all of the universities in Beijing accept foreign students.  Most foreign students are on Chinese language programs which can last from a few weeks to a couple of years.  If you have a sufficient HSK level <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://hsk.org.cn/english/">[23]</a>  you can enroll in programs to study other subjects.
Most of the international business offices are in Chaoyang Distrct around Guomao, Dawang, Wangfujing and Chaoyangmen.  The <b>Central Business District</b> (CBD) is centered around Guomao.  Many technology companies have offices in Wangjing (sub-district in Chaoyang District) and Zhongguancun (Haidian District).
Like all of China, finding a job teaching English in Beijing is relatively easy for native speakers.  In fact, if you are of European descent some employers may assume that you are already qualified enough to teach English to Chinese students. However, more prestigious employers (especially universities and high-end language schools) will generally require an English teaching qualification and a Bachelor's degree (normally in any discipline, although sometimes specifically in English/linguistics). Reputable institutions will provide proper working visa category to ensure legal employment; those which do not are not advised.

Throughout nearly all markets in Beijing, <a href="/en/Haggling" title="Haggling" class="mw-redirect">haggling</a> is essential.  Especially when browsing through large, "touristy" shopping areas for common items, do not put it beneath your dignity to start bargaining at 15% of the vendor's initial asking price. In fact, in the most "touristy" markets final prices can often be as low as 15%-20% of the initial asking price, and "removing a zero" isn't a bad entry point in the bargaining process.  After spending some time haggling, never hesitate to threaten walking away, as this is often the quickest way to see a vendor lower his or her prices to a reasonable level. Buying in bulk or in groups may also lower the price. How high or low the vendor sets the asking price depends on the customer, the vendor, the product's popularity, and even the time of day. Vendors also tend to target visible minorities more, such as Caucasians or people of African descent.
The are a number of interesting <b>markets</b> around Beijing where you can find all kind of cheap (and often fake) stuff.  Some of the most popular places are Xizhimen in <a href="/en/Beijing/Xicheng#Buy" title="Beijing/Xicheng">Xicheng District</a>, Silk Street or Panjiayuan in <a href="/en/Beijing/Chaoyang#Buy" title="Beijing/Chaoyang">Chaoyang District</a> and Hong Qiao Market in <a href="/en/Beijing/Chongwen#Buy" title="Beijing/Chongwen">Chongwen District</a>.
As an alternative to the markets you can go to some of <b>the shopping areas</b> lined with shops.  This includes Nanluoguoxiang in <a href="/en/Beijing/Dongcheng#Buy" title="Beijing/Dongcheng">Dongcheng District</a> and Qianmen Dajie Pedestrian Street, Dashilan and Liulichang in <a href="/en/Beijing/Xuanwu#Buy" title="Beijing/Xuanwu">Xuanwu District</a>.
If you are looking for <b>traditional Chinese food shops</b> try Yinhehua Vegetarian in <a href="/en/Beijing/Dongcheng#Buy" title="Beijing/Dongcheng">Dongcheng District</a>, Daoxiangcun, Liubiju or The Tea Street in <a href="/en/Beijing/Xuanwu#Buy" title="Beijing/Xuanwu">Xuanwu District</a>. Please note that Chongwenmen Food Market in <a href="/en/Beijing/Chongwen#Buy" title="Beijing/Chongwen">Chongwen District</a> has been demolished in 2010.
Visiting <b>hotel shops and department stores</b> is not the most characterful shopping in China, but worth a look. While generally significantly more expensive, they are less likely to sell truly low quality goods. The old style of Chinese retailing is gradually being transformed by shops with a better design sense and souvenir items are getting better each year. Silk clothing, table settings and so on and other spots around town, are worth a look, as are porcelain, specialty tea and other traditional items.  Some of the most popular areas for this kind of shopping are Wangfujing and The Malls at Oriental Plaza both in <a href="/en/Beijing/Dongcheng#Buy" title="Beijing/Dongcheng">Dongcheng District</a> as well as Xidan in <a href="/en/Beijing/Xicheng#Buy" title="Beijing/Xicheng">Xicheng District</a>.
<b>Antiques</b>
The <b>carpet</b> business is strong in Beijing and you will find all manner of stores selling silk carpets and other varieties.

<b>Peking Roast Duck</b> is a famous Beijing specialty served at many restaurants, but there are quite a few restaurants dedicated to the art of roasting the perfect duck.  Expect to pay around Â¥40 per whole duck at budget-range establishments, and Â¥160-200 at high-end restaurants.  Beijing duck (åäº¬ç¤é¸­ <i>BÄijÄ«ng kÄoyÄ</i>) is served with thin pancakes, plum sauce (çé¢é± <i>tiÃ¡nmiÃ n jiÃ ng</i>)ï¼and slivers of scallions and cucumbers. You spread the sauce on the pancake, put a few pieces of duck, cucumber, and scallions.The end result is a mouthwatering combination of the cool crunchiness of the cucumber, the sharpness of the scallions, and the rich flavors of the duck.
The best way to eat well and cheaply in Beijing is to enter one of the ubiquitous restaurants where the locals are eating and pick a few different dishes from the menu. Truth be told, visitors can find Beijing a very inexpensive city for food, especially considering that tipping is not practiced in China (instead along with taxes, built into the menu price). Some of this is due to low wages for restaurant workers and farmers, use of genetically modified or engineered ingredients, or flavor enhancers or preservatives to help speed flavors along or quicken the cooking process.
Some of the cheapest and most delicious meals can be had on the streets.  <b>Savory pancakes</b> (çé¥¼æå­ <i>JiÄnbÄ­ng guÅzi</i>) are one of the most popular street snacks, eaten from morning till night with most carts operating during the morning commute and then opening again at night for the after-club crowds and night-owls. This is a Northern Chinese specialty. This delicious pancake is cooked with an egg on a griddle, a fried dough crisp is added, and the whole thing is drizzled in scallions and a savory sauce.  Hot sauce is optional. Not all street vendors are licensed and more than a fair share use recycled oil. For travelers unused to such and spending a few weeks in town may do well to avoid street vendors all together, or risk upset stomachs or worse. Diehard fans often go on a quest for the best cart in the city.  This  treat should only cost Â¥2.50, with an extra egg Â¥3. There are many styles, such as the egg is fried flat on top of the pancake and the toppings wrapped inside, or folded like a taco.
<b>Lamb kebabs</b> (ç¾èä¸²å¿ <i>yÃ¡ngrÃ²u chuÃ nr</i>) and other kebabs are grilled on makeshift stands all around Beijing, from the late afternoon to late at night. Wangfujing has a "snack street" selling such mundane fare like lamb, chicken, and beef as well as multiple styles of noodle dishes, such as Sichuan style rice noodles, but the brave can also sample silkworm, scorpion, and various organs all skewered on a stick and grilled to order.
A winter specialty, <b>candied haw berries</b> (å°ç³è«è¦ <i>bÄ«ngtÃ¡ng hÃºlu</i>) are dipped in molten sugar which is left to harden in the cold and sold on a stick.  You can also find variations with oranges, grapes, strawberries, and bananas, or dipped in crumbled peanuts as well as sugar.  This sweet snack can also sometimes be found in the spring and the summer, but the haw berries are often from last season's crop.
The most famous street for food in Beijing is probably <b>Guijie</b> (ç°è¡/é¬¼è¡ <i>GuÇjiÄ</i>), see <a href="/en/Beijing/Dongcheng" title="Beijing/Dongcheng">Dongcheng District</a> for further detail.
<b>Street food in Beijing</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://theme.hobobe.com/guijie/index.html">[49]</a> Gui Street (ç°è¡) is located within Dongzhimen, East of the street from Second Ring Road of the Western part of the Dongzhimen overpass and West of the street from East Main Street eastern end crossing.
Gui Street now showcases many excellent cuisines, the centre of a food paradise. Stretching over one kilometer, 90% of the commercial shops in the street house more than 150 eateries. You can definitely find most of the larger restaurants in the capital here. Therefore Gui Street is known for its street food in Beijing.
<b>Quanjude (å¨èå¾·)</b> is the most famous restaurant for Peking Duck and is a national chain. Unlike McDonaldâs, the quality, as well as price, among  different Quanjude restaurants differs greatly.  For quality and authentic Peking Duck, only two Quanjude restaurants should be patronized: one in Qianmen (åé¨) and one in Hepingmenï¼åå¹³é¨ï¼.  Both of them are in central locations, providing the most authentic Peking duck dishes (and their prices are dearest too), but the former is right in the middle of tourist area and there is always a very long queue during lunch or dinner time.  The latter is just one subway station away from former with a much bigger capacity, and you will be guided to your seats in no time when you walk in.
Beijing is also known for its <b>mutton hotpot</b> (æ¶®ç¾è <i>shuÃ n yÃ¡ng rÃ²u</i>), which originally came from the Manchu people and emphasizes mutton over other meats.  Like variations of hotpot (general name ç«é <i>huÅ guÅ</i>) from elsewhere in China and Japan, hotpot is a cook-it-yourself affair in a steaming pot in the center of the table.  Unlike Sichuan hotpot, mutton hotpot features a savory, non-spicy broth. If that's not exciting enough for you, you can also request a spicy broth (be aware that this is flaming red, filled with peppers, and not for the weak!). To play it safe and satisfy everyone, you can request a yuan-yang (é¸³é¸¯ <i>yuÄnyÃ¡ng</i>) pot divided down the middle, with spicy broth on one side and regular broth on the other.  Raw ingredients are purchased by the plate, including other types of meat and seafood, vegetables, mushrooms, noodles, and tofu, so it's also perfectly possible to have <b>vegetarian hotpot</b>. A dipping sauce, usually sesame, is served as well; you can add chilis, garlic, cilantro, etc, to customize your own sauce. While "raw" sounds dangerous, boiling the meat yourself is the best way to ensure that more risky meats like pork are fully cooked and free of germs. In the city center, hotpot can run as much as Â¥40-50 per person, but on the outskirts it can be found for as little as Â¥10-25.  Low-budget types may reuse the spices or cooking broth from previous guests, although it has been boiling for several hours.
Beijing provides an ideal opportunity to sample food from all over the country. Some of Beijing's best restaurants serve food from <a href="/en/Sichuan" title="Sichuan">Sichuan</a>, <a href="/en/Hunan" title="Hunan">Hunan</a>, <a href="/en/Guangzhou" title="Guangzhou">Guangzhou</a>, <a href="/en/Tibet" title="Tibet">Tibet</a>, <a href="/en/Yunnan" title="Yunnan">Yunnan</a>, <a href="/en/Xinjiang" title="Xinjiang">Xinjiang</a>, and more.
For <b>vegetarians</b>, Beijing's first pure vegetarian buffet restaurant is located a Confucius Temple, see <a href="/en/Beijing/Dongcheng" title="Beijing/Dongcheng">Dongcheng District</a> for further detail.
Korean restaurants are also very common in Beijing, due in part by northern Chinese (males in particular) strong liking of meat. A frequent meal is the grill-it-yourself barbeque, including beef, mutton, chicken, and seafood items as well as some vegetables including greens and potatoes. Restaurants that serve abalone and sharkfin are considered the most expensive restaurants in the city. Expect to pay upwards of Â¥800 for a "cheap" meal at one of these restaurants, much more if splurging.
<b>Tea</b>, tea, and more tea!  Some shops are in malls and others are stand-alone establishments. Whatever their location, always ask the price before ordering or else brace yourself for the most expensive egg-sized cup of tea in the world. You can experience different styles of tea ceremonies and tea tastings at <b>tea houses</b> especially in the Qianmen area south of Tian'anmen Square.  These can range widely in quality and price. Some tea houses are really tourist traps whose main goal is to milk you of your money (See warning box). You can get a <i>free</i> tea demonstration at most Tenrenfu tea houses which are located throughout the city and at some malls. A private room or a quiet back table in a tea house with mid-range tea for two should cost Â¥100-200. After an afternoon in such shops the remaining tea is yours to take home. Once tea is ordered, the table is yours for as long as you like.
As a tea-loving country and grower of much of the world's tea, <b>coffee</b> is not as easy to find but a taste for it--along with more expats dotted throughout Beijing--has seen more emerging middle class and students drinking it. For example, the city alone has more than 100 Starbucks locations. Most are situated around shopping malls and in commercial districts of the city. Other international chains such as Costa Coffee and Lavazza also have locations around Beijing. Coffee of varying qualities is also available in the ubiquitous Taiwanese style coffee shops such as <b>Shangdao Coffee</b>. These are usually located on the second floor of buildings and often times offer Blue Mountain Coffee, making places like Starbucks seem a real bargain. Most coffee shops offer wireless. Baristas in non-chain coffee shops may not be educated on how to make generally accepted espresso drinks, like lattes and cappuccinos. Espressos, alone, usually taste better and are more consistent.
<b>Chinese beer</b> can be quite good and nearly all are lagers. The most preferred beer is Tsingtao (éå² <i>QÄ«ngdÇo</i>) which can cost Â¥10-20 in a restaurant, or Â¥2-4, depending on size, from a street vendor, Beijing's homebrew is Yanjing (çäº¬ <i>YÃ njÄ«ng</i>), and has a dominating presence in the city (Yanjing being the city's name from its time 2,000 years ago as capital of the state of Yan).  Beer mostly comes in large bottles and has 3.1%-3.6 alcohol content. Both Yanjing and Tsingtao come in standard (æ®é <i>pÇtÅng</i>) and pure (çº¯ç <i>chÃºnshÄng</i>) varieties; the difference mainly seems to be price.  Beijing Beer (åäº¬å¤é <i>BÄijÄ«ng PÃ­jiÇ</i>ï¼is the probably the third most popular brand. Craft beers are also making an appearance in Beijing, with specialty beers found in various German-themed restaurants throughout the city and a growing number of foreign-style microbreweries, including Great Leap, Heping Brewpub, äº¬A (Jing A), Panda Brewery and Slow Boat.
Great Wall is the most popular local brand of grape <b>wine</b>.  Wine made in China does not have a great reputation, though this is changing. Giving wine as a gift is not a common custom in most places in China and most people will not be accustomed to wine etiquette or appreciation (white wine is often mixed with Sprite in clubs).  Imported red wines are usually of a better quality and can be found in big supermarkets, import good stores, and some restaurants.
The most common <b>hard liquor</b> is baijiu (ç½é <i>bÃ¡ijiÇ</i>), made from distilled grain (usually sorghum) spirits. It comes in a variety of brands and generally for very cheap prices (Â¥8 for a small bottle) and should be avoided if you want to have a clear mind for your travels on the next day. The most famous local brand is called Erguotou (äºéå¤´ <i>ÃrguÅtÃ³u</i>), which has 54% alcohol content. It should be noted that the local Erguotou is sold in gallon containers, often on the same shelf as water and with a similar price-range and indistinguishable colour. Care must be made not to confuse the two. Maotai (èå° <i>MÃ¡otÃ¡i</i>), the national liquor, is one of the more expensive brands, and it used to cost about as much as an imported bottle of whiskey--but now it costs a lot more, from Â¥1,000 to well in excess of Â¥10,o00. Wuliangye (äºç²®æ¶²) is another high-end brands, costs around Â¥1,000. Due to its mild taste, Wuliangye might be a better option for first time baijiu drinker. A large selection of imported liquor can be found at most bars and big supermarkets. One should better buy expensive liquor (both domestic and imported) from big supermarkets in order to avoid fake ones.

Most of Beijing's bars are located in one of the bar clusters around the city.  A few years back, the only one was Sanlitun, but almost every year the last few years have seen a new area emerge.  The most important areas are:
<i>See the <a href="/en/Beijing#Districts" title="Beijing">Districts</a> articles for individual listings.</i>
Accommodation aplenty exists in the CBD, various embassy areas, universities and business parks. A few hotels are also located very close to the airport (one, Hilton Airport, is not connected but essentially in one of the airport parking lots).
Tour groups can, perhaps unsurprisingly, reserve rooms at high-quality hotels at rates far below those published. Hostels and western-style travel hotels are almost universally open to foreign guests. The lowest end Chinese accommodations - Zhaodaisuo (æå¾æ) - are generally inaccessible to the foreign community. However, for those determined to get a bargain, you <b>may</b> be able to get a room if you speak Mandarin. Many of the hostels are located in <a href="/en/Beijing/Dongcheng#Sleep" title="Beijing/Dongcheng">Dongcheng District</a> and <a href="/en/Beijing/Xuanwu#Sleep" title="Beijing/Xuanwu">Xuanwu District</a>. Discounted rates start around &#165;30 for dorms and just below &#165;200 for doubles in the cheapest hostels.
There are a large number of three and four star mid-range hotels throughout the city and in all districts.  The listed rates for these kind of hotels are often in the range of &#165;500-1,000 but you can often get a discount of around 50%.
Some 'expensive' hotels are in the city centre, especially in <a href="/en/Beijing/Dongcheng#Sleep" title="Beijing/Dongcheng">Dongcheng District</a> and on the eastern 3rd Ring Road in <a href="/en/Beijing/Chaoyang#Sleep" title="Beijing/Chaoyang">Chaoyang District</a>, however by Western standards these hotels are still relatively cheap.  In the outlying areas, especially out by the <a href="/en/Great_Wall_of_China" title="Great Wall of China">Great Wall</a>, are some country club type resorts as well as some unique, one-of-a-kind, hotels.  For the most expensive hotels, the listed rates start at around &#165;4,000, but are often discounted to a level around &#165;1,500.
Overall, Beijing is a very safe city. Violent crime is extremely rare, and it's not a problem to walk at night in urban areas. Beijing also enjoys the reputation of low crime rates in Asia and even the world.
Some petty crimes such as pickpockets should be cautious in the main shopping streets, tourist attractions and public transportations. Thieves are more active in the days before the Chinese New Year. Be very careful in those days.
Despite safe urban areas, some parts of Beijing's suburbs are not safe, because they concentrate almost all severe crimes of the city. They are called "Beijing's corner". Such as the middle western area of Fengtai, the western area of Shijingshan, the eastern frontier of Chaoyang, and the most parts of Daxing (except communities surrounding the metro route). Taxi drivers may refuse to take you to those places, and you should not go there indeed.
Tourists are often preyed upon by cheats and touts, who attempt to pull a number of <a href="/en/Common_scams" title="Common scams">scams</a> on tourists.  Be especially cautious in the inner city, around Tiananmen Square, and on the tourist-crowded routes to the Great Wall.
On the other hand, fears of scams have led many travelers to be overly dismissive of Chinese people who approach them. Many Chinese are tourists in their capital for the first time as well and they are genuinely curious about foreigners and may just want to practice their English and get a picture with you. Being asked to have your picture taken is very common and there are no known scams associated with this. Be friendly but don't feel pressured to go somewhere you hadn't planned on going in the first place. If you are outside the tourist areas then your chances of being scammed drop dramatically.
Chinese people are very friendly to travelers and foreigners in general; seeing through a scam requires the same common sense as travelling anywhere in the world. Beijing scams are not particularly innovative or brutal in world-wide comparison, and as long as you <i>keep your wallet out of sight</i>, you can always walk away without fear of violence or theft. That said, there are some common scams to be aware of.
Traffic can be crazy in Beijing, and reckless driving is fairly normal. Loud, persistent honking is commonplace. It is simply another way to indicate that the driver is there. Be prepared for drivers to violate traffic laws even to the extent of going in reverse on highways to back up to a missed exit or driving on a sidewalk. Also expect occasional road debris (a piece of wood or torn out tire) to be laying in the roadway. At night, be careful of missing manhole covers or road work taking place without warning or without proper illumination at night. Pedestrians should be very careful crossing the street people will generally stop for you, but they will honk. Keep an eye on the locals and cross with them â there is strength in numbers. Also note some construction trucks will abuse the speed limit and also are known to at times ignore traffic signals. Proceed when clear, not necessarily when the traffic light is green.

Remember these three telephone numbers, and they are valid in almost entire mainland China.

<b>Air pollution</b> has traditionally been a big problem in Beijing, and is typically ranked in the bottom 10 in domestic air quality rankings. Coal burning (used to generate majority of energy and heat), automobile exhaust, and dust storms from the Gobi desert combine to make some of the worst city air on the planet. Winter is the worst time as the cold air creates an inversion layer and traps the pollution in the city. A white surgical face mask may help with the occasional dust storms. A much higher-grade filter is needed to prevent 2.5mm particulates from entering the body. The government has implemented various measures to attempt to combat with the man-made and natural air quality issues. Beijing's water supplies are also commonly found to contain high levels of toxic substances.

Many available throughout the city which can post international mail.
Internet is highly restricted in China. Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube are completely blocked, and it is not uncommon for many foreign websites not to load. Examples of partially blocked sites include Wikipedia, Blogspot, and Tumblr. To circumvent this problem you can purchase a commercial VPN to tunnel out of the firewall. These can cost from free to ~Â¥120 per month. Be aware that free versions have security holes and can increase your chances of getting hacked.
Free WiFi can be found in all sorts of chain and independent cafes and fast food restaurants, and many sit-down restaurants as well. These cafes can look like restaurants from the outside, but most any place that is called a cafe will have Wifi. Wifi is also common in hostels and hotels. Faster connections may be available for a small fee.
Terminal 3 has a wireless network "Airport WiFi (FREE)". Passengers need to register for an account and then be granted five hours of use.
Laundry is inexpensive to be done in Beijing, as are some dry cleaning shops. Other dry cleaners near embassy areas or the CBD may be of higher quality, or simply of higher cost. If near Peking University, try Jingquan laundry service next to several dormitories in the southwest corner of the campus.
Long distance cyclist-tourists will find national road 109 is a pleasant way to enter or leave Beijing, though lots of work.  It immediately enters steep hills on the edge of the city, but sees little traffic, is well maintained and passes though lovely landscape of farmland and forests.  It's remarkable how close to Beijing you are, and how far it feels.
"2) Crossing the border by bus
Buses from Erlian to Zamyn-Uud leave from Erlian bus station on the corner of Chahaâer Street and Youyi Lu near to the Mongolian Consulate. At the time of writing, there is a bus at 13:30 and at least one more later in the afternoon around 15:00. Taking the 13:30 bus should give you enough time to get on the 17:35 Zamyn-Uud to Ulaanbaatar train. This, however, is subject to tickets being available when you arrive in Zamyn-Uud, which, if you arrive in the afternoon, may be unlikely.
