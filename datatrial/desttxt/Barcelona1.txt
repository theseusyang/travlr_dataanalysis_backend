<b>Barcelona</b> is <a href="/en/Spain" title="Spain">Spain</a>'s second largest city, with a population of nearly one and half million people (nearly five million in the metropolitan area) and the capital and largest city of <a href="/en/Catalonia" title="Catalonia">Catalonia</a>.
This city, located directly on the northeastern Mediterranean coast of Spain, has a rich history dating back at least 2,000 years when it gained prominence as a Roman town under its old name, <i>Barcino</i>.
In 1992, Barcelona gained international recognition by hosting the Olympic games which brought a massive upturn in its tourism industry.
This had the effect of changing the city in ways that are still felt today with neighbourhoods renovated (and in some cases levelled) and the intense focus of modern design permeating all aspects of life in Barcelona from public buildings to something as simple as a park bench or an event poster.
For visitors, this has translated into the very modern, yet incredibly old city you see now in the 21st century, where the new elements work to both preserve and celebrate the ancient.
This beautiful city is full of what European cities are known for (outdoor markets, restaurants, shops, museums and churches) and is fantastic for walking with an extensive and reliable Metro system for more far-flung destinations.  The core centre of town, focused around the <i>Ciutat Vella</i> ("Old City") provides days of enjoyment for those looking to experience the life of Barcelona while the beaches the city was built upon provide sun and relaxation during the long periods of agreeably warm weather.<br clear="all" />
August is probably the busiest time in Barcelona; at the same time about 10% of shops and restaurants can be found closed from mid-August to early September, when the owners go on vacations. In the centre of Barcelona you will find most shops and restaurants open. However there will still be plenty of tourists. Barcelona has decent enough beaches but the locals will really appreciate it if visitors do not consider it a beach resort and don't wear beachwear when visiting churches, restaurants, etc.
Barcelona is great off-season and is a lovely city even in winter months of January and February as long as the possibility of rain is low. During these months the city is not too cold averaging between 9-10Â°C with sunny and blue skies. Given the high humidity, 19-23Â°C is considered comfortable weather, which is normally the temperature between April and June and between late September to November. This is the best time to visit the city. Anything warmer than this can feel too hot.
Toddler happiness is considered a public responsibility in Spain: in any public place people around you put every effort into making your toddler happy: whenever he or she looks bored or is crying, everyone does their best to entertain or to calm them.

Trick: You can also take a RyanAir carrier to an inner city like <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://wikitravel.org/wiki/en/index.php?title=Zaragoza">Zaragoza</a> and then use the train to reach Barcelona one hour and 30 minutes later. Those flights are ussually much cheaper (around 35 euros from Paris, London or Brussels).
<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.aena-aeropuertos.es/csee/Satellite/Aeropuerto-Barcelona/en/">Barcelona-El Prat International Airport</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IATA" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:IATA">IATA</a>: <b>BCN</b>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICAO" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:ICAO">ICAO</a>: <b>LEBL</b>), is a major transport hub and flights land from all over Europe and beyond.
There are now two terminals, <b>T1</b> and <b>T2</b>, the latter with A, B, and C subdivisions. T1 and T2 are linked by a bus shuttle (every 5-7&#160;min, travel time 12&#160;min).
<b>T1</b>, the newer terminal, hosts Iberia, Air Europa and a variety of major international airlines, including Singapore Airlines, Qatar, Pakistan Intl., Emirates, Delta Air Lines, US Airways, American Airlines, Air Canada, Avianca, AerolÃ­neas Argentinas, Alitalia, CSA, SAS, TAP, Lufthansa, Austrian, Air France, KLM, British Airways, LOT, Tarom, etc.
Sectors A, B and C of <b>T2</b> are all within fairly easy walking distance of each other.
Please be aware that you can check in for your flight only at the respective terminal T1 or T2 and, since they are 7&#160;km apart and there is little information available at the train station and bus stops, <b>it's good to know which terminal you need before arriving at the airport</b>! <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.aena-aeropuertos.es/csee/Satellite/Aeropuerto-Barcelona/en/Page/1045569607351//Departures.html">AENA</a> provides information about the allocation of airlines to terminals.
The airport is only about 12-14&#160;km away from the city centre.
<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.aerobusbcn.com/">AerobÃºs</a> is the city's shuttle bus service that connects the Airport (both terminals) with the centre of Barcelona (PlaÃ§a Catalunya), leaving every 5-10 minutes (A1), every 10-20minutes (A2), every day of the year.  The "A1" line takes you to/from Terminal 1 and the "A2" line takes you to/from Terminal 2.  The shuttle bus service is available everyday from 5:30am to 1am, and the journey lasts about 30 minutes (although it can take considerably longer during rush hour).  From the Airport, the shuttle bus makes a total of 4 stops: PlaÃ§a Espanya, Gran Via - Urgell, PlaÃ§a Universitat, and finally PlaÃ§a Catalunya. To the Airport from PlaÃ§a Catalunya, the shuttle bus only makes a total of 3 stops: SepÃºlveda - Urgell, PlaÃ§a Espanya, and finally the Airport.  A one-way ticket to/from either Terminal costs â¬5.90 or you can buy a return ticket for â¬10.20 which you must use within 9 days (you can pay by either credit card or cash). Buses are heavily air-conditioned in Summer, so consider having something extra to wear during the journey.  AerobÃºs stops running after 1am, but you can catch a NitbÃºs night bus service instead (line N17 to T1 or line N16 to T2, 22.00-05.00 every 20 min. The ride from PlaÃ§a Catalunya to the Airport takes about 40-50 min).
The cheapest, but slower option than AerobÃºs, is a bus 46 serving both T1 &amp; T2. Its last stop in Barcelona is PlaÃ§a Espanya reached in 25-30 minutes. The one-way ticket costs â¬2 and can be purchased from the driver. Even cheaper is to buy a T10 Travelcard from the machine located at the train staition outside Terminal 2; this offers even greater value and convenience if further transfer by metro, bus, tram etc. will be needed as the T10 Travelcard journey is valid for 75 mins - see the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Barcelona#Train">Transfer by Train</a> section for details. Between 11 pm and 6 am the 46 bus service is replaced by N16/17 buses; they take a diversion adding some ten minutes to otherwise a very rapid journey ending at the same PlaÃ§a Espanya.
A cheap and fast option is the half-hourly RENFE R2 Nord suburban train line calling at Sants (travel time is 18&#160;min), Passeig de GrÃ cia (24&#160;min), Eln Clot-AragÃ³ (30&#160;min) and more stations beyond Barcelona city limits. Please be advised that this airport train has changed, and no longer terminates at EstaciÃ³ de FranÃ§a (it now goes through the centre of Barcelona and into the suburbs, so it is important to know at which station you should get off). The train terminates next to T2 by section B, with a connecting green coloured bus service to T1 (plan for an extra 15&#160;min of travel). The airport train station has got facilities for disabled people: escalators, lifts, etc. A single ticket for the train is about â¬3.15, <b>but</b> you can also buy a T10 travelcard (â¬9.80 for ten trips over any period of time; each of those trips includes 3 bus, metro, train or tramway transfers made within 75&#160;min) instead. You can buy a T10 from the ticket vending machine at the airport station and at the tobacco shop in front of Terminal 2B; you can <b>not</b> buy a T10 travelcard at Terminal 1!
If you arrive at T1, you'll need to catch the free airport transfer bus (it goes from T1 to T2B then T2C then loops again to T1) and stops right next to the Aerobus stop. The ride is at least 10 minutes long. Get off the bus, head into the terminal, follow the sign to Renfe, go up the escalators, leave the terminal building, go through the overhead pass till you get to the train station. About a 10-20 minute walk. Buy the T-10 pass and use it to access the station.
Airport transfers can be arranged for groups, taxis are available but expensive (â¬30-40 to the city centre). Taxis and Minibuses can be pre-booked on-line:
Some low-cost carriers, notably Ryanair, use airports in <a href="/en/Girona" title="Girona">Girona</a>, nearly 100&#160;km to the north, or <a href="/en/Reus" title="Reus">Reus</a>, around the same distance to the south, instead. Since Ryanair recently started operating at Barcelona El Prat (airport code BCN) check using the three-letter airport codes where your flight actually goes. Girona's airport code is GRO and Reus's airport code is REU.
For <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.aena-aeropuertos.es/csee/Satellite/Aeropuerto-Girona-Costa-Brava/en/">Girona Airport</a>, the Barcelona Bus service runs a shuttle bus from Estaci&#243; del Nord (which is walking distance to the Arc de Triomf metro stop) in Barcelona to Girona Airport and this ties in with various flight times. A one-way ticket costs â¬16 and a return ticket costs â¬25. The journey takes approximately one hour and ten minutes. Timetables are available  <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.sagales.com/index.php?nIdioma=LANG3">on-line</a>.
For <b>Reus Airport</b>, the easiest way to get there is to take the bus run by Hispano Igualadina from the Barcelona Sants bus station to the airport. Bus departures are synchronized with Ryanair plane departures/arrivals. One way ticket costs â¬13 and a return ticket costs â¬24. The journey takes c. 100&#160;min, depending on the traffic on the motorway. Timetables are available <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.igualadina.com/pdfs/REUS%20AIRPORT.pdf?">on-line</a>. A slightly cheaper, yet longer option is to take a train from Barcelona Sants station to Reus and then the local bus no. 50 to the airport. The train costs â¬7.25 and then the bus costs â¬2.10. This takes roughly about two and a half hours. Train timetables can be checked at <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.renfe.com">Renfe's website</a>. The bus timetable is available at the website of <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.reustransport.cat/pdf/L50.pdf">Reus public transport</a>.
Several trains per day (including overnight hotel trains) from other parts of Europe (via France) are regular and reliable.
Main train stations:
From EstaciÃ³ de Sants and Passeig de GrÃ¡cia there are several connections per day to <a href="/en/Cerb%C3%A8re" title="CerbÃ¨re">CerbÃ¨re</a> (France), connecting there on trains towards <a href="/en/Marseille" title="Marseille">Marseille</a> and <a href="/en/Nice" title="Nice">Nice</a>. There are also one or two direct "Talgo" trains a day from Sants to Perpignan, Beziers, Narbonne and Montpellier in France.
Overnight <i>Trenhotel</i> trains operated by <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.elipsos.com">Elipsos</a> runs daily from <a href="/en/Paris" title="Paris">Paris</a>-Austerlitz while depatures from <a href="/en/Milan" title="Milan">Milan</a> and <a href="/en/Zurich" title="Zurich">Zurich</a> are every second day. All trenhotels trains terminates at the EstaciÃ³ de FranÃ§a station. Prices starts at â¬74 for second class.
There is also a less-well-known rail line over the Pyrenees to <a href="/en/Toulouse" title="Toulouse">Toulouse</a>. There are four trains per day to La Tor de Querol (Latour-de-Carol), where it is possible to transfer to a French train bound for Toulouse. The journey takes 7-8&#160;hr (including transfer) and costs roughly â¬30 one way.
After very long delays, the high-speed line between Barcelona and Figueres finally opened in early 2013.  Previously, it was necessary to take a 100 minute train to Figueres and then change for a TGV service.  However, now the high-speed line is open, the journey is just 53 minutes with one intermediate stop in Girona.  It is intended that direct TGV services to Barcelona will soon be introduced.
The long-delayed AVE high-speed train line to <a href="/en/Madrid" title="Madrid">Madrid</a> finally opened in February 2008. Travel time is 3&#160;hr with intermediate stops (11 trains a day) or 2.5&#160;hr non-stop (6 trains a day during morning and evening peak hours).
The city's port is one of the busiest on the Mediterranean, with nine passenger terminals, seven for cruise liners and four for ferries. Large cruise ships dock 1-2&#160;km to the southwest. Many offer bus-shuttles to points near the south end of La Rambla.
You can arrive to Barcelona by boat from the <a href="/en/Balearic_Islands" title="Balearic Islands">Balearic Islands</a>, <a href="/en/Genoa" title="Genoa">Genoa</a>, <a href="/en/Rome" title="Rome">Rome</a>, <a href="/en/Livorno" title="Livorno">Livorno</a>, <a href="/en/Sardinia" title="Sardinia">Sardinia</a>, <a href="/en/Tangier" title="Tangier">Tangier</a>, and <a href="/en/Algiers" title="Algiers">Algiers</a>. From Rome (<a href="/en/Civitavecchia" title="Civitavecchia">Civitavecchia</a>) it is actually cheaper than the bus. The <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.barcelonaturisme.com/Arribar-en-vaixell/_dHcEaVlbphzpxz9nGRHHNvmgn_IyLv0OvnCbQGAGY7I">ferry</a> docks almost directly on the Ramblas.
You can have your luggage picked up and stored or transferred to the airport <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.bcnluggageservices.com">[1]</a> and <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.alquilerdeyatesenibiza.com">[2]</a>
There are several main roads leading to Barcelona from France and Spain and traffic is usually relatively light outside of peak hours. It is possible to find free parking spaces a few metro stops from the centre of the city.
Blue parking spaces must be paid for M-Sa 09:00-14:00 and 16:00-18:00. At some crossroads the free time ends at 08:00. Anyone can use a blue space but they aren't that easy to find. You pay at the meter and put the ticket on the dashboard. Green parking spaces are for residents only. White parking spaces are free at all times but there aren't any in the city centre.
The <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.bsmsa.cat/mobilitat/index.php/bsm-car-parks/advantages-and-discounts/special-rates">city car parks</a> have some special offers for tourists.
The department store El Corte Ingles publishes a helpful (and free) street map for tourists. You can pick a copy at the store, or from most hotel front desks. They're also available at the tourism information offices (including one at each terminal at Barcelona El Prat Airport).
Parking around all major tourist destinations is expensive (â¬3/hour, â¬20-36/day) and the spaces are difficult to navigate, as there are several classes of public parking spaces, with complicated rules for each class. Barcelona is plagued with the same problems that plague other major European cities; massive traffic jams and extremely narrow streets in some areas, coupled with a very complicated road system. As such, driving yourself around is not recommended for tourists, especially those with no driving experience in large cities. Public transport will get you to all the major areas, and you should use that as your main mode of transport.
Having a driving map is essential - plan your route before you set off. Navigating with an average tourist map is frequently misleading: many streets are one-way; left turns are more rare than rights (and are unpredictable). As an example, <i>Gran via de Les Corts Catalanes</i> is technically two-way, but in one direction supports only minor traffic: after every crossroad you'll find the traffic light on the next crossroad turns red by the time you reach it.
But if you have to take a rent a car there are several companies there to get great car rental rates like Sixt rent a car <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.sixt.com/car-rental/spain/barcelona">[14]</a>, Hertz, Europecar and more
Some free parking spots reported by travelers are:
Getting around by car makes sense if you plan to spend much more time driving outside the city borders than inside it - and ideally if you don't plan to park overnight at all. Otherwise, for purely in-city transportation, consider renting a scooter, or using public transportation instead.
Barcelona's official languages are <a href="/en/Catalan_phrasebook" title="Catalan phrasebook">Catalan</a> and <a href="/en/Spanish_phrasebook" title="Spanish phrasebook">Spanish</a>. However, most signs are indicated only in Catalan because it is established by law as the official language. Yet, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other facilities, though announcements in the Metro are made only in Catalan. As in most other cities, any attempt by visitors to use the native languages is always appreciated. Most locals are bilingual in Catalan and Spanish, and instinctively address foreigners in Spanish. Catalan is a language, not a dialect, and sounds closer to Italian, Portuguese, and French in many ways. Avoid referring to Catalan as a dialect, which will offend Catalans.
These issues regarding language, national identity, and politics are like politics anywhere, and there's no way to summarize here. 60% of the people in Catalonia use Spanish as their first language whereas 40% use Catalan.
In tourist areas, almost all shops and bars have some English speaking staff. People will generally make an effort to try to help you if you speak in English. If you are a native English speaker you will not have any problem as Barcelona is a very touristic city.
<b>What to see in the dark</b><br />
The most spectacular sights in the night are:
Walk around the winding streets and hidden squares, fountains and palaces in the <b>Barri GÃ²tic</b> (<a href="/en/Barcelona/Ciutat_Vella" title="Barcelona/Ciutat Vella">Ciutat Vella</a>).
If you are thinking of visiting several museums, an "articket"<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.articketbcn.org/en/barcelonamuseums">[15]</a> will save you some money. It is a combined ticket costing â¬30 and covering admission to six museums.
The Temple of the Roman colony of Barcino date of the first century BC, was dedicated to the imperial cult. The building was located on the axis of the Forum, an arcaded square where the main public buildings clustered in the city, the church or the bar, where he met the Ordo Decurionum or municipal senate, there was the market on all products sold arriving anywhere in the Mediterranean.
The temple overlooking the city, which rises on a podium which is accessed by a staircase, but had also built a small hill's highest point, known as Mons Taber on which built Barcino. Today the remains of the Temple is located inside a building which houses four columns and Corinthian fluted shaft, and architrave of the podium.

One of the most famous and breathtaking locations to visit in Barcelona the most famous building in the entire city and its landmark, La Sagrada Familia. Although incomplete, the church is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and in November 2010 was consecrated and proclaimed a minor basilica by Pope Benedict XVI.  From the outside, visitors are astonished by the sheer height and intricacy of the design of the church and although it is not completed yet, the progress that has been made is incredibly impressive. The project began nearly a century ago and was designed by one of Spainâs most well known and respected architects in Spanish history, Antoni Gaudi. Gaudi was born a Catalan (ethnic group in Spain) and produced some of the most moving building and works of art that are still standing and praised by the Spanish people. Undoubtedly, his most famous work is La Sagrada Familia. La Sagrada familia is a masterpiece in the center of the city of Barcelona. The height of the church is exactly equal to the height of the largest mountain in the nearby hills, the reason being because Gaudi felt that no man-made creation should ever rise above Godâs natural creations. The height of the church is overwhelming when standing at its base and the inside is even more impressive.
Upon first walking into the church one cannot help to feel their stomach drop as they witness one of the most impressive and beautiful creations known to man. Visitors first gaze up at the height that the ceiling extends to, supported by beautiful hand shaped columns, which were hand-shaped to resemble the trunks of trees. As a lover of nature, Gaudi included many elements of Godâs natural beauty within his work. As visitors move towards the center of church they cannot help but to twist their head in a full 360 to admire all of the stained glass windows that line the walls of the church. During the day these windows produce incredible natural light (a personal favorite of Gaudi) that illuminates the sheer beauty of the inner monastery.
The church is absolutely breathtaking. La Sagrada Familia is an absolute must see for every visitor in Spain and the Barcelona. It is truly a masterpiece and is sure to please visitors of all ages. Images of this majestic church can be found <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.google.es/search?q=la+sagrada+familia&amp;hl=es&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Rt44UZzDAsGM7QawxoDgAw&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CAcQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1129&amp;bih=1005">here</a>.
Be careful when visiting, as there are certain restrictions on dress in this and the Barcelona Cathedral.Bare shoulders, knees and feet are not permitted and unless adhered to you will not be granted access. Information to this effect is not really given anywhere you may have already looked.
To avoid the queue, tickets may be booked online and collected at Segrada Familia itself. You will need to indicate the time of visit. If you plan visit either the Passion Tower or the Nativity Tower, the ticket will grant you entry one hour before the scheduled time you booked. You can stay in Segrada Familia for as long as you want after descending the Tower. The Passion Tower has elevator both ways. The Nativity Tower option means you to take the elevator up and walk all the way down. You enjoy the view of the city as you climb down, not the external wall of the Tower.
Named the #1 Beach City in the world by <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://travel.nationalgeographic.com/travel/top-10/beach-cities-photos/#/beach-barcelona-spain_21757_600x450.jpg">National Geographic</a>, Barcelona's beaches are world-renowned.  Although locals prefer that you do not stroll through the city in beachwear, the beaches themselves have a very open and relaxed atmosphere.  As with many other European beaches, you will find topless (and even nudist) beach-goers.  Unlike many European beaches, however, you will find fun and friendly "chiringuitos" common on Spanish beaches that offer you a place to sit down and listen to music while you have a drink and grab a bite to eat directly on the sand as you watch beach-goers strolling by. Please be aware that the sand at the main beaches is quite rough - may have small stones and shells as well.
<b>Beach Season</b>
The Barcelona beach season starts around March 15th and goes until around November 15th.  The High Season for beach-goers is usually from the end of May until the end of September.
<b>Barcelona's Beaches</b>
<br />
Barcelona hosts a number of annual fiestas, many of which are unique to Catalonia and offer an insight into its distinctive culture.
During festivals and especially during mobile world congress<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.mobileworldcongress.com/">[23]</a> which is a major trade show at the Fira, accommodation in Barcelona and especially near the Fira is much more difficult to find and more expensive than usual.
For those visitors who wish to get a real taste of Barcelona, you can join a group of English-speaking local guides for free sightseeing tours. In addition to exploring major landmarks and famous streets, you will also get stories, recommendations and tips that only a local could provide. These professional guides are passionate about their city and offer tours which are both educational and fun. These walking tours are based on a tip supported service.
For those wishing to make a real attempt at learning the language, there are plenty of Catalan and Spanish language schools in Barcelona.
Most shops and shopping malls are closed on Sundays because of law restrictions, but not all. In <a href="/en/Barcelona/Ciutat_Vella" title="Barcelona/Ciutat Vella">Ciutat Vella</a> you will find plenty of small fashion shops, souvenir shops and small supermakets open on Sundays.  The souvenir shopping scattered throughout the Barri Gotic and all along La Rambla are tourist traps, none of them sell Catalan or Spanish products but the typical array of Chinese general souvenirs, they should be avoided. Moreover on the the Port Vell, right at the end of The Ramblas there is Maremagnum, a shopping mall that stays open all Sundays.
Barcelona's cuisine is inconsistent in quality, as with all highly touristic cities, but good food does exist at reasonable prices. The golden rule of thumb applies well in Barcelona; to save money and get better food, look for places off the beaten track by fellow travellers and seek out cafes and restaurants where the locals frequent. A good idea is to avoid restaurants with touts outside.
<b>Where to eat during siesta</b><br />
Majority of restaurants and cafes are closed between 4PM and 8PM for <i>migdiada</i>. If you failed to plan for that, here are some places you can eat during this period:
<b>Set menus (menÃº del dia)</b> Most restaurants (and some bars) offer a <i>menÃº del dia</i> (menu of the day), which usually means a simple and unpretentious two course meal (one salad, main dish and a drink; plus a dessert sometimes), 3 or 4 options each, with a drink and a dessert, for â¬8 to â¬15-20, depending on a restaurant.  Keep in mind these are not going to be huge portions.  Typically you will get all of the items listed, but they will be one or two mouthfuls at most (i.e., all of the food will fit on one standard sized plate).  During the week, some smart restaurants offer lunch specials from 2PM to 4PM. The savvy traveler will try the hip places for a fraction of the price during the day.
If you're looking for a place where everyone can choose their own meal, ask for restaurants that serve <i>platos combinados</i>, which is the closest thing to an American/Northern European meal.
<b>Smoking:</b> Is not permitted in restaurants anymore.
You can get food from any part of the world in Barcelona, but make sure you try some Catalan food.
<i>See <a href="/en/Catalonia#Catalan_Cuisine" title="Catalonia">Catalan cuisine section in the Catalonia article</a>.</i>
The selection of <b>seafood</b> is consistently great, although not a lot of it is local (this part of the Mediterranean is pretty well fished-out).
A treat to try that no travel guide mentions is <b>waffles</b> sold at street stands. They will tempt you with their mouth watering smell and taste.
Even though tapas restaurants are now all over the city, tapas itself originated in Andalusia in the south of Spain and is NOT native to Catalan cuisine.  Catalans generally eat three course meals (appetizer, main dish and dessert) and would more likely go for a pre-dinner drink and pintxos (Basque counterpart for tapas) at a Basque taverna than for a meal consisting entirely of the new trend in tapas-only dining.  As you travel to smaller towns in Catalonia outside of Barcelona, it is less likely that you will find tapas and more likely to see restaurants serving traditional Catalan food in three courses.
Depending on where you are in the city, there may be restaurants galore, or none at all. The following areas tend to be restaurant "hubs", with a large variety of restaurants to choose from:
Around PlaÃ§a Catalunya there are dozens of restaurants serving excellent <i>tapas</i>.
For budget eating you may choose "menu del dia" in small bars on the Avinguda del Parallel for â¬9-â¬11 per person. Be aware that sometimes the menu and the staff are only in Spanish.
The large cafes that line the Passeig de GrÃ cia and the Rambla Catalunya, just north of the PlaÃ§a Catalunya, offer a variety of acceptable tapas. This part of the town is quite touristy and a bit expensive.
â¬10 is the lowest price for a standard <i>menu del dia</i>; for less it can be only canteen or budget-style eating--or fast food.
In several supermarkets you can find a wide stall with a great selection of ready-to-eat dishes. You can get a two-course lunch for less than â¬5.
Barcelona Wok - Comte d'Urgell 46 - 48. â¬9 per head all you can eat - great sea food.

Barcelona is Europe's <a href="/en/Pickpockets" title="Pickpockets">pickpocketing</a> capital. <b>Never keep your wallet, cash or important documents in trouser pockets or in bag pockets: a money belt is an easy and inexpensive way to prevent being robbed.</b> As always, be alert in crowded places, such as public transport, train and bus stations, La Rambla and Raval. People may approach you asking for change, or to change money. Just ignore them. If you are asked to change money, then official-looking police may approach you afterwards to 'check' your wallet for ID, etc. These are not police, so be at your most vigilant or you might find they have taken a few cards or cash upon returning your wallet.
<a href="/en/Pickpockets" title="Pickpockets">Pickpockets</a> use the football trick as the local specialty. At certain tourist hotspots, there are people who will try to show you a 'magic trick'. This involves tying a piece of string around your finger. While you are distracted (and your arm is effectively disabled), an accomplice will pickpocket you. It is also possible that criminals will pose as tourists and ask directions to approach their victims. Keep your distance and be careful in tourist places.
The subway is a hotbed for pickpocketing activity, which can range from simple opportunistic thefts to coordinated attacks. Be especially wary on the subway platforms at Sants train station and Sagrada FamÃ­lia. A group of men will come out of seemingly nowhere while you attempt to enter a subway car and block your entrance <i>and</i> exit in a coordinated manner, effectively pinning you against the doors while they close. They will act as if the car is just crowded and they are trying to get on as well, but, in reality, they have already gone through your pockets. Once they take stuff, they quickly return to the platform and walk off calmly while you are trapped in the departing subway as they make sure they exit just before the doors cannot be reopened. Violence in these situations is rare, and in most cases the goal of the thieves is to rob you undetected.
Stay vigilant: do not leave anything in a back trouser pocket (except maybe a map of the city). Hold on to your bag or purse at all times. Do not leave anything unattended while you sit in a cafe or restaurant. Traveling with another person or persons is a good practice. Have the others look out. The impression that you are paying attention is enough to deter most thieves. This makes someone else an easier target than yourself.
Scams are incredibly common, especially in very touristy areas. The number one thing to remember about a scam is that you should never speak with someone you don't know who walks up to you in a crowded area. Do not sign their petition, give them directions, or help them with their problem. Being rude is actually your best defense against scams. You can't be tricked if they don't have time to speak with you.
A common scam in Barcelona involves fake police officers, usually claiming to be "undercover" who will ask to see your passport or identification, then take your belongings when they can and run away. Overall various scams happen in the city which seems always preformed by a group of professional scam artists. When it happens, it's pretty ok to just walk away instead of start any sort of conversations with them. Another trick is that one seemingly confused person will ask you for directions, diverting your attention and then suddenly fake police will appear asking for your ID. These are organized scams to steal things from you. If such incident happens, follow the advice above and just walk away, without listening to any of their conversation or speaking to them. Stay alert, especially in busy tourist areas near the Sants station and PlaÃ§a d'Espanya.
Another popular scam happens in the metro. A group of scammers (often middle-aged women) will surround a tourist, frantically asking for directions. Most tourists wont know what to say while one of the scammers empties their pockets. They will try to confuse the tourist while the metro stays in the platform, and will get out just before the doors are closed. When you realize you've been scammed, the train will have already left and they will be safely outside with your belongings.
The bird droppings scam is also common. One or more accomplices will secretly spray or throw a smelly liquid on you. When you look up thinking a passing bird has pooped on you, they will run up to you and tell you that they saw a bird poop on you. They will offer to help you clean up, and while you are cleaning they will go through your pockets and any bags you have set down. It is wise to beware of anyone who is attempting to touch a complete stranger.
A version of <a href="/en/Common_scams#Three_Card_Monte" title="Common scams">Three Card Monte</a> is one of many <a href="/en/Common_scams" title="Common scams">common scams</a> played on Las Ramblas. There are also people holding petitions to install a wheelchair lift in locations with a lot of stairs (or any other thing, usually very vague, that they think you won't be in favor of, such as a petition "against drugs"). Once your signature is obtained they will then aggressively ask for a donation. Sometimes there can be crowds of children demanding money with hardly anyone else in the area, making it difficult to get away.
There is a flat tire scam that seems to be popular in Barcelona that targets rental cars or those with foreign license plates.  There are a few varieties of this particular scam, but it involves distracting the driver and passengers by mentioning a flat tire.  Sometimes they are pedestrians crossing the street, other times they are people on motorcycles, but they are almost always working in teams.  Those in the car check to see if their tire is actually flat while someone reaches in to grab whatever they can.  This can happen in traffic, but sometimes they'll offer to show you a garage nearby where you can get it fixed or they will offer to help you.  In some instances, there will be absolutely no damage to your tire and in other cases the thieves will actually knife your tire.  Be sure to keep your doors locked while driving in the city and watch for any suspicious motorbikes stopping near your car.
Choose an ATM in a quiet area to avoid being <a href="/en/Common_scams#ATM_scams" title="Common scams">targeted</a>. Barcelona is particularly well-equipped with ATMs. Many offer a wide range of services (withdrawals, transfers, mobile credit recharges, ticketing, etc.) and accept credit cards of various banks.
Most ATMs will not charge you a fee to withdraw funds (though your bank still may, of course). Catalunya Caixa is an exception: they will charge a several euro fee, so avoid their ATMs.
Be careful in tourist areas. A variety of <a href="/en/Common_scams#Overcharging" title="Common scams">methods</a> are employed, including the <a href="/en/Common_scams#no_change_trick" title="Common scams">No Change trick</a>
Women traveling alone should exercise caution while exploring the more isolated parts of MontjuÃ¯c. The city beaches, particularly the ones adjoining Barceloneta, have proven to be quite lucrative for bag snatchers. Anything that one would rather not lose is best left, locked, in one's hostel or hotel.
Men traveling alone should expect the prostitutes on Las Ramblas in the early hours to be very aggressive and in league with pickpockets and robbers.
Also, people need to be careful when leaving the bars of the Olympic Port late as there are many pickpockets around.
Women should be wary of wearing exposed jewellery such as gold chains and necklaces. People walking down a street may be attacked from behind by a thief who may grab the necklace and try to rip it off the woman's neck before quickly running away, often down a convenient side street. This can even happen in daylight hours and in the full sight of others on the street.
In the event of such a robbery, people will need to find the local police station to report the incident, especially if a travel insurance claim is going to be made.
Parts of Barcelona are covered by closed circuit TV surveillance, but only the more popular spots.
Tourist drivers may attract special attention, such as <a href="/en/Common_scams#Red_light_bag_snatch" title="Common scams">Red light bag snatch</a> or <a href="/en/Common_scams#Flat_tire" title="Common scams">Flat tire scams</a>
If you need to report a crime (for example, to claim on travel insurance), be prepared for the reality that in the downtown police station, officers may not speak English, despite that fact the official theft report form is in both English and Spanish. The police station most often used to report theft is the one underneath PlaÃ§a Catalunya beside metro station, they have got translators for English, French, etc.
