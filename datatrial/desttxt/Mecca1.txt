<b>Mecca</b> or Makkah (Arabic: ÙÙØ© Ø§ÙÙÙØ±ÙØ© <i>Makkah al-Mukarramah</i>), located in western <a href="/en/Saudi_Arabia" title="Saudi Arabia">Saudi Arabia</a>, is the holiest city in Islam. It is strictly forbidden for Non-Muslims to enter the city and this is strongly enforced.
A pilgrimage to Mecca, known as the <a href="/en/Hajj" title="Hajj">Hajj</a>, is one of the Five Pillars of  Islam, and thus obligatory for all Muslims with the physical and financial ability to make it. Over three million Muslims visit the city during the month of Dhu'l-Hijjah yearly. Visits outside this month are known as minor pilgrimages or Umrah, and while not compulsory are strongly encouraged. This is also the place where the <b>Prophet Muhammad</b> was born. Mecca also has a very rich history as it is a very old city which has been considered sacred since the early middle ages. It is also the birthplace of Islam and is the most sacred place for Muslims.
The government of Saudi Arabia issues special visas for those making the pilgrimage.  Most pilgrims opt to use a specialist travel agency, which will handle the considerable paperwork for them, but detailed information on the strict requirements is available at the Ministry of Hajj <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.hajinformation.com/">[1]</a>.  As usual in Saudi Arabia, women must travel together with a male guardian (<i>Mahram</i>), unless they are over 45, travelling with a group and have their guardian's signed consent.
Visas are assigned to countries on a quota basis according to the number of Muslims they have.  Recently, those who have previously been to Mecca have had additional restrictions placed on their entry, in an effort to discourage overcrowding while still accommodating those who have not yet made the pilgrimage.  If the applicant was not born a Muslim, they must present a certificate testifying so, which has been notarized by an Islamic center.  Usually your mosque will be able to arrange this or at least point the way.
<a href="/en/Jeddah" title="Jeddah">Jeddah</a> is the gateway to Mecca. The Hajj Terminal at <b>King Abdulaziz International Airport</b> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IATA" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:IATA">IATA</a>: <b>JED</b>), used only for the Hajj, is served mostly by charter flights, although there are some scheduled services. During Umrah, scheduled services use the airport's other terminals.
There is an excellent modern multi-lane highway from <a href="/en/Jeddah" title="Jeddah">Jeddah</a>. During the Hajj pilgrimage season it is jammed with buses full of pilgrims. At any other time, traffic is extremely light for the size of the road.
A few miles outside Mecca, there is a cutoff referred to as the "Christian bypass". Turn along this highway to drive another 50 miles out of the way to reach the lovely mountain town of <a href="/en/Taif" title="Taif">Taif</a>. Taif, at 5000 feet elevation, was the former summer palace of the Saudi Kings. If you remain on the main highway, there is a police checkpoint just after the exit, where non-Muslims are kept out of the holy city.
SAPTCO runs services to Mecca from throughout the country, although most pilgrims arrive on privately chartered buses from <a href="/en/Jeddah" title="Jeddah">Jeddah</a>.  There are two terminals: the main terminal outside city limits is open to all, but the city center terminal at the Haram al Sharif, used mainly by buses to Jeddah, is restricted to Muslims only.
Local buses, taxis, and micro-buses are widely available in Mecca and are inexpensive. The 18 km (11 mi) Al Mashaaer Al Mugaddassah Metro opened in November 2010. A total of 5 metro lines are planned to carry pilgrims to the religious sites.
