Saint Petersburg (<a href="/en/Russian_phrasebook" title="Russian phrasebook">Russian</a>: Ð¡Ð°Ð½ÐºÑ-ÐÐµÑÐµÑÐ±ÌÑÑÐ³ <i>Sankt-Peterburg</i>;) is a world-class destination and <a href="/en/Russia" title="Russia">Russia</a>'s second largest city, with a population of more than 5 million perched at the eastern tip of of the Baltic Sea and the Neva River.
The city was formerly known as Petrograd (ÐÐµÑÑÐ¾Ð³ÑÌÐ°Ð´), and later Leningrad (ÐÐµÐ½Ð¸Ð½Ð³ÑÌÐ°Ð´).
This is one of the most breathtakingly beautiful places on earth, and virtually any building in the <i>large</i> historic center, threaded with canals dotted with baroque bridges, can be considered an attractionâand indeed, it is a <a href="/en/UNESCO_World_Heritage_list" title="UNESCO World Heritage list" class="mw-redirect">UNESCO World Heritage site</a>. This is a magical city, with a long list of major attractions. Its Hermitage Museum, housed in the Winter Palace of the Romanov Dynasty, is both one of the world's greatest and oldest collections of art, treasure, and antiquities, and one of its most beautiful buildings.
Founded by Peter the Great in 1703, in the territory of Inkeri town of Nien which was a capital of Finno-Ugric province Ingermanland which was part of Novgorod Republic, and Sweden. The first settlements in this region date from 2500 years ago. Archaeologists found old graves full of izhora silver treasures, also korela-inkeri epos of Kalevala halfly was written near Sester river, modern Sestroretsk. In this time the lifestyle of aborigines was very different it was forest people which lived in tunnels underground, famous for hunting, mushroom medicine, and making steel. It was place of joining three finno ugric subethnosos suomi Inkeri and Karela, St Petersburg the former home of the tsars and the center of imperial Russian culture, Saint Petersburg was known as "The Venice of the North" in its heyday.  Re-christened <b>Petrograd</b> during the first World War, the city was renamed <b>Leningrad</b> in 1924 in honor of communist revolutionary and founder of the Soviet Union, Vladmir I. Lenin.  Bombed, besieged and starved during World War II, the city took a back seat to <a href="/en/Moscow" title="Moscow">Moscow</a> during the Soviet-era.
Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the city has rapidly been making up for lost time and is by far the most cosmopolitan and Western of Russia's cities. Renamed once more in the aftermath of the fall of the Soviet Union, most Russians know it as <b>Piter</b> (ÐÐ¸ÑÐµÑ), a familiar diminutive of Saint Petersburg.
During the hardship years of Yeltsin's presidency, much of the city was controlled by the infamous Tambov gang, but have since reduced in influence. With world-class architecture, astonishing views and friendly people, there's lots to do here.
<b>AprilâMay</b> sees warmer temperatures, but snow is not uncommon, and the sludge resulting from the melting snow gets tiresome fast. This is also that time of year when you should be wary of giant thawing icicles overhead, which threaten the occasional impaling. 9 May is <b>Victory Day</b> (ÐÐµÐ½Ñ Ð¿Ð¾Ð±ÐµÐ´Ñ) celebrating the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany. This day is marked with an opening military parade on Palace Square, directly in front of the Hermitage, visiting various war monuments, giving flowers to war veterans who are dressed in full military outfits, and an evening parade down Nevsky Proskpect which includes survivors of the Leningrad blockade.  27th of May - is Foundation day. It is always festival and music during the day and fireworks at the evening.
<b>June</b> is peak tourist season during the famous <b>White Nights</b> (roughly, 11 Juneâ2 July), when the sun sets only for a brief period of twilight, and the streets stay alive around the clock. The last ten days of June, during the White Nights Festival of all-day performances, concerts, festivals, and parties, are the busiest time of the season and it can be difficult to reserve accommodation and transport. Book early.
<b>Julyâearly September</b> are usually the warmest months, albeit a bit humid. Rain showers  are possible throughout this time, so it is always a good idea for one to have an umbrella at all times. Last Sunday of July is a NAVI day. Modern NAVI ships of Baltic fleet are staying in Neva embankments and open for visitors.
<b>Late SeptemberâOctober</b> is a lovely time in the city. The humidity and temperatures drop to moderate with strong winds, and the tourists are all gone. Rain is still common.
<br />
While yes, the city gets cold in the winter, there are a couple advantages to a visit <b>NovemberâMarch</b>: there are hardly any touristsâeven domestic tourists, so you won't see the barest hint of the long lines of the summer at the Hermitage; Saint Petersburg's neoclassical streets are also simply gorgeous in the snow. Temperatures can range from relatively mild to very cold.  All major tourist attractions are still open and some hotels offer lower prices during this time.  But be prepared to dress warmly, as temperatures can easily dip -25C (-13F) with blustery winds. The biggest danger, though, is the ice. The city's lovely marble surfaces, when mixed with snow and ice, create a very real danger of slipping and seriously hurting yourself. Wear good boots, take small steps, and watch your feet!
Keep in mind that <b>New Years</b> is the biggest holiday of the year in Russia.  Reserving a hotel room is usually not a problem during this time, but be prepared for very large crowds and noisy celebrations.
Russian visa requirements are complex but should not be feared. Numerous visa services exist to help in this area. See the <a href="/en/Russia#Get_In" title="Russia">Get In</a> section of the article on <a href="/en/Russia" title="Russia">Russia</a> for information. The visa is not required for 72 hours if you arrive to St.Petersburg by ferry.
<b>Pulkovo Airport</b> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IATA" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:IATA">IATA</a>: <b>LED</b> | <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICAO" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:ICAO">ICAO</a>: <b>ULLI</b>) <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.pulkovoairport.ru/eng/">[1]</a> serves a wide variety of destinations both international and domestic. Terminal 1 serves domestic flights, selected international charter flights and low-cost airlines, while Terminal 2 is reserved for international connections. The airport is located approximately 17 kilometers south from the center.
The airport is served by two local bus lines: line 39 from terminal 1 and line 13 (til 00:40am) from terminal 2 both going to Moskovskaya metro station with a frequency of 8 minutes costing 35 rubles one way with a trip taking around 30 minutes. Then change to metro line 2 (blue) which takes 15 minutes to the city centre.
Both bus routes to Moskovskaya pass Aeroport railway station a few minutes from the terminal, where you can change to a local commuter train to Baltijskij rail terminal (taking 18 min) in the city centre. However, these trains can run over an hour apart, so best to check the timetable first <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.tutu.ru/spb/rasp.php?st1=5201&amp;st2=20600">[2]</a>. For going back to the airport, press the small arrow at the top.
New night buses have been introduced recently, so you can go to Moskovskaya by line 13 (till 00:40am) and then change to night bus line to the city centre.
Taxis at Terminals 1 and 2 have now joined a structured pricing scheme based on geographic zones, and taxis can be ordered from the service booth in the arrivals hall (Terminal 1 - before baggage claim; Terminal 2 - by the exit door to the street).  The fixed price for a taxi to the central district (Nevsky Prospekt/Hermitage area) is 900 RUB plus luggage surcharges.  The trip by taxi will take around 30 minutes without traffic, but can take over two hours during the day. Those who speak Russian and have a cell phone can order a taxi by phone for a lower price than the taxis at the airport. Companies such as 068 or 6000000 (which are also their respective phone numbers) charge about 500-550 rubles for a trip to the city center/Hermitage area. The operator will take the order, then call you back to tell you the license plate number and color/model of the taxi that will meet you. They will also tell you the fare in advance, so there is no need to haggle. If calling from the airport arrival hall, it will take about 15-20 minutes for the taxi to arrive.
You might want to consider to pre-book your taxi through Internet. It will cost slightly more, approx 1200 RUB to the heart of the center, but you will be welcomed in the arrival hall by your driver carrying a sign with your name. You are out of the airport in minutes. Pre-book through Internet is without risk, no credit card information is asked, and pre-payment is not required.
Lappeenranta airport in <a href="/en/Finland" title="Finland">Finland</a> is a small provincial airport located near the border of Russia and offers a low-cost alternative to Pulkovo Airport. It has become popular among Russian travellers, because it offers low-cost flights to Central Europe and is quite small airport not having the rush problems of bigger airports.
The airport is located only 2 km from the center of Lappeenranta. Air Baltic has a route to Riga. Ryanair has routes to DÃ¼sseldorf-Weeze and Milan-Bergamo.
There is a local bus connection number <b>4</b> from center of Lappeenranta to the airport. It serves once an hour. See more information from Lappeenranta local transport timetables <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://lprwilima.lappeenranta.fi:8080/nettinaytto/">[3]</a>.
Direct coach connection from Lappeenranta to Saint Petersburg leaves from railway station of Lappeenranta and the duration is about 6 hours. More information from Matkahuolto <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.matkahuolto.fi">[4]</a>.
Connection buses from Lappeenranta to Vainikkala railway station offer possibility to use a train from Lappeenranta to Saint Petersburg. Connection bus travel time between Lappeenranta City and Vainikkala is 30 minutes and train travel time between Vainikkala and Saint Petersburg is 1,5 hours.

Saint Petersburg is a major rail hub. The 3.5-hour train ride from <a href="/en/Helsinki" title="Helsinki">Helsinki</a> (<a href="/en/Finland" title="Finland">Finland</a>) is one of the most comfortable ways to reach the city. Trains also connect to destinations in the <a href="/en/Baltics" title="Baltics" class="mw-redirect">Baltics</a> and <a href="/en/Central_Europe" title="Central Europe">Central Europe</a>. Alternatively, you can head inland to <a href="/en/Moscow" title="Moscow">Moscow</a>.
There are five principal stations:
<i>Note</i>: Varshavskii Station (<i>ÐÐ°ÑÑÐ°Ð²ÑÐºÐ¸Ð¹ Ð²Ð¾ÐºÐ·Ð°Ð»</i>) is now closed, trains to/from Poland arrive at the Baltic or Vitebsk Stations.
Until recently, you could only buy a ticket for a Russian train at a train station, but now you can purchase an electronic train ticket.
The Finnish VR Group provides excellent information on train travel from Finland to St Petersburg <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.vr.fi/en/index/ulkomaat/venaja/allegro.html">[8]</a>.  Now operated with slick new high-speed <i>Allegro</i> trains running at up to 220 km/h, there are four daily departures from <a href="/en/Helsinki" title="Helsinki">Helsinki</a> at 05:12, 09:00, 14:00 and 18:00.  Tickets can be purchased through some travel agencies and at major VR <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.vr.fi/en/index.html">[9]</a> train stations in Finland. Tickets are also available for purchase in the VR Online Shop <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.vr.fi/en/index/junaliput/lippujen_ostopaikat/verkkokauppa.html">[10]</a>.  Border crossing formalities start immediately after departure from Helsinki. On board currency exchange is available. Train is the most expensive way of travel between Helsinki and Saint Petersburg.
The easiest way to get between downtown <a href="/en/Moscow" title="Moscow">Moscow</a> and St.Petersburg's heart is by a <i>Sapsan</i> high-speed express. The ride takes between 3h 45min and 4h 45min, there are 6 daily departures in both directions. This train boasts a full English-speaking crew. Ticket prices are within 2500 and 3500 roubles for second-class accommodation.
There are also numerous slower trains, most of them overnight, linking the two cities in 7 to 8 hours, up to two dozen departures daily. Price and comfort levels vary, with the luxurious <i>Grand-Express</i> private "hotel train" at the high end (featuring even some room-sized compartments for two equipped with a shower!), all the way down to budget connections in third-class <i>platzkart</i> or even seating-only cars. Second-class <i>coupe</i> coaches are most recommended, with the fare generally under 2000 roubles. Lower class tickets may save you half the price or more, if you are prepared for such travel conditions.

The cheapest, although by no means the most comfortable way of reaching Saint Petersburg from neighboring countries are long distance buses. Buses from <a href="/en/Belarus" title="Belarus">Belarus</a>, <a href="/en/Ukraine" title="Ukraine">Ukraine</a>, <a href="/en/Germany" title="Germany">Germany</a>, <a href="/en/Finland" title="Finland">Finland</a>, the Baltic states and <a href="/en/Scandinavia" title="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a> stop at the main bus station (Avtovokzal).

For travel from <a href="/en/Helsinki" title="Helsinki">Helsinki</a> (Finland), <b>Russian minibuses</b> depart from the Oktyabrskaya Hotel (opp Moskovsky train station) around 10 PM and arrive behind Tennispalatsi at EtelÃ¤inen Rautatiekatu 8, one block away from Kamppi, early in the morning. Departures back start around 10 AM in the morning through 8 PM.  Other minibuses are parked along Fredrikinkatu, with the departure time and price often posted on them. The trip costs â¬ 15 to 25 euros, depending on how much the driver wants to charge, making this by far the cheapest option, but the buses are cramped and uncomfortable. Do not expect drivers to speak anything but Russian. The border crossing time might be substantially longer than with regular buses.
Some people reported that even if your citizenship may not require a visa to enter Russia, the Russian immigration agents may not be aware of it and may refuse you entry into Russia. They only speak russian, and the process is lengthier than when travelling by train or air.
Two private bus companies also run overnight routes to and from <a href="/en/Estonia" title="Estonia">Estonia</a>, <a href="/en/Latvia" title="Latvia">Latvia</a> and <a href="/en/Lithuania" title="Lithuania">Lithuania</a> as well as to <a href="/en/Belarus" title="Belarus">Belarus</a> and the <a href="/en/Ukraine" title="Ukraine">Ukraine</a>:

Nearly all the major cruise lines (Princess, Norwegian, Royal Caribbean, Holland America, Carnival, Celebrity, MSC, etc.) offer a Scandinavia/St. Petersburg itinerary, and many stay overnight to allow shore excursions to Moscow.  Azamara has itineraries that dock for three days/two nights. If you join a cruise tour of St. Petersburg then you don't need a Russian visa, but you have to stay with the tour.
Most means of transportation stop functioning at night. The subway is closed from midnight to 5:45 a.m., and transfers between lines close (and open) at this time, while the departure of the last (and the first) trains from each station varies slightly. Taxis are always available but are much more expensive at night. Every private vehicle is a potential taxi. Flagging down a vehicle and paying for a ride somewhere is perfectly normal in Russia and quite popular although ill-advised for tourists. Safety is, of course, an issue. As a rule, you should never get in a private cab if it already has passengers inside.
Also, refuse requests from the driver to take on more fares unless you reached your destination; if he insists, ask to stop at a safe-looking place, pay and leave. If the driver stops for gas, step out of the car, along with your belongings, and get some fresh air while he is fueling it. Those traveling alone (men and women) should feel free to wave off any suspicious ride for any reason whatsoever. Gypsy cabs which linger near popular bars and restaurants at night have been known to be especially dangerous, with several instances of druggings and robberies.
At night the city is divided in two by the Neva; all the main bridges are drawn up to allow for boat traffic, except during the winter, when ice makes the river impassable. Remember to make it to your side of the river in time; otherwise, you could find yourself stuck on the wrong side until early morning. One bridge, <i>Volodarsky</i>, closes once per night from around 3:45 a.m. to 4:15 a.m to permit crossing. Most of others are up between 1:45 a.m. and 5:15 a.m.; see below for details. There is however the tall cable Big Obukhovski bridge which is not drawn up, as it is an important part of Saint Petersburg Ring Highway, but it's rather remote from the city center which would multiple the taxi fare several times.
The following table represents a drawn schedule of Saint Petersburg bridges in 2009 (as of 15 April), which may have changed since:
Saint Petersburg's <b>metro</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.metro.spb.ru/">[17]</a> is the second largest underground railway system in Russia, second only to <a href="/en/Moscow" title="Moscow">Moscow</a>.  The subway is a cheap and effective way to get around the city, and also a major tourist attraction in itself thanks to the beautiful decorations of the stations. Taking pictures was once prohibited, but amateur photography (without a tripod, etc) is now allowed.
The trains are fast and run frequently (during rush hour, there are often only 30 seconds between trains). The metro costs 28 rubles per entry regardless of the distance. Brass tokens (Ð¶ÐµÑÐ¾Ð½ &#8211; <i>zheton</i>) can be purchased from kiosks at station entrances and vending machines, and it is good to stock up in advance, since queues can be long. You have to pay an extra token if you have a big baggage.
Metro maps can be found in every train car and always have station names in the Latin alphabet. The station names on the platforms are also in the Latin alphabet, and many other signs are in English. Station announcements on the train are only in Russian, but if you listen carefully you will hear the conductor announce the current station name and the next station as the doors are closing.
Stations are deep, and transfers between stations also involve long walks.  There is little time saving to be made travelling between adjacent stations in the historic centre.
The Saint Petersburg metro can be unbelievably crowded during rush hour. Avoid traveling during this if not accustomed to big crowds.  Be aware of your belongings and expect to have to push your way out upon arrival.
A more scenic, but slower, way to see Saint Petersburg is by tram (<i>ÑÑÐ°Ð¼Ð²Ð°Ð¹</i>). In recent years, due to traffic problems, some tram lines were removed from the centre of the city. They cost 25 rubles and are sold by a conductor sitting in the tram.
Buses (<i>Ð°Ð²ÑÐ¾Ð±ÑÑ</i>) and trolleybuses (<i>ÑÑÐ¾Ð»Ð»ÐµÐ¹Ð±ÑÑ</i>) are cheap (25 rubles) and frequent. They cover many areas of the city that the metro doesn't.  There is no map for the trolleybuses, but Google Transit comprehensively shows all the routes making it easy to navigate using the buses with this service.
Trolleybuses are indicated by the letter 'M' on the stops, and diesel buses by the letter 'A'.  The two types of buses themselves both show the same route number, but the trolleybus route is frequently shorter, and can vary in some minor respects.
Tickets are sold by a conductor sitting in the bus. Every bus has its own conductor.  The conductor will work their way up and down the aisle of a crowded bus, and just handing them the correct change is sufficient.  The conductors don't like giving much change, and only speak Russian.
Buses and trolleys on main routes are frequently overcrowded. Buses to suburbs cost 19 or 36 rubles within the territory of St. Peterburg (<a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Zelenogorsk&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Zelenogorsk (page does not exist)">Zelenogorsk</a>, <a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Lomonosov&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Lomonosov (page does not exist)">Lomonosov</a> and others). If you are caught without a valid ticket you will be fined 300 rubles.
Since July, 1 (2012) night buses have been introduced. They have the same routes as metro has, but the problem of the bridges is not resolved.
Route taxi (<i>Ð¼Ð°ÑÑÑÑÑÐºÐ° - marshrutka</i>) is sometimes the fastest way to get somewhere. Taxis are 14-20 seat vans, usually white or yellow, always with a  letter K and route number plate (K-28). Often they are small Chinese or Turkish buses. There are no regular stops; you must tell the driver when you want to get out, or wave while on the roadside to stop one. You must pay to the driver at entry, usually from 20 to 35 rubles. If you cannot reach the driver on your own, pass the money through the other passengers and be ready to pass other's money if you sit close to the driver. The <i>Marshrutka</i> experience may seem exciting sometimes, especially when you see some brave driver counting change while steering with his knees at 70 MPH (110 km/h). Many <i>marshrutka</i> drivers are illegal immigrants and speak Russian poorly (if any at all).
Another interesting means of transportation is special taxi for tourists and visitors. The service runs 24/7 and offers English language support, low fares and online booking before landing (Pulkovo 1, 2). The service is new and operates through community friendly social networks like couchsurfing and facebook. For further information check <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.couchsurfing.org/group.html?gid=63369">Couchsurfing</a> or <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.facebook.com/spbtrans">Facebook</a>.
Regular taxis are available, but drivers do not usually speak English.  Watch out for overpriced taxis outside Hermitage museum.  They have meters that run four times faster than those of regular taxis.  A 3km ride on these runs 1600 rubles.  Negotiate a flat fare before getting on the taxi.  If the driver insists on using the meter you should walk away.
A commuter train (ÑÐ»ÐµÐºÑÑÐ¸ÑÐºÐ°, elektrichka) may be an option in areas distant from metro stations, such as the airport. Fares are based on travel distance, a ride within city limits should cost under 30 rubles. Speeds are moderate, but trains may be rare (1-2/h). Information available in here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://rasp.yandex.ru">[18]</a>.
The <a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Historic_Center&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Historic Center (page does not exist)">Historic Center</a> of Saint Petersburg and Related Groups of Monuments are <a href="/en/UNESCO#Russia" title="UNESCO" class="mw-redirect">UNESCO</a> world heritage <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/540">[19]</a>, so definitely worth your while.
Ticketing is complex, but the Hermitage itself is 300 rubles for Russians and 400 rubles for foreigners (2013) and they do check if you have a Russian passport, even if you speak Russian. Students of <i>all</i> nationalities get in for free, but don't forget your student card with photo (the 'administration' will likely reject your ID if it doesn't have a date on it). Entrance is free on the first Thursday of every month. Large bags aren't allowed in the museum, and a massive cloakroom downstairs (no charge, as usual in Russia) exists to assist with jackets and bags.  A ticket allowing photography costs 200 rubles. Some rooms and all temporary exhibits prohibit all kinds of photography.
<b>Getting into the Hermitage</b><br />
Advice for foreigners visiting the Hermitage Museum: Find a tour group. This may have changed, call the museum ahead of time to find out.: Entry fee is 200 rubles instead of 400, and includes the photography fee and a whistle-stop tour of the museum (but note the free entry for students). Don't accept a tour from the numerous touts hanging around the queue. Instead, march past the queue and in through the main entrance, or the exit opposite if the queue's blocking the entrance (don't worry, you're not queue-jumping). Have a scout around for notices with museum tour times in your native language, or in extreme circumstances, ask at the desk. If you find a good candidate, you're all set to go to the Tours Office to book yourself on it. This is where things get slightly surreal. To get to the Tours Office from the main entrance, go forward past the cashiers, and turn left down the corridor. The Tours Office is in front of you at the end, and may or may not be marked. Get yourself a place on your tour, collect the bit of paper, go to cashier No. 5 (who is not with the rest of them, instead turn left out of the Tours Office and she's in a box at the end of the corridor), pay, get your paper stamped, take it back to the Tours Office and get it checked, stamped again and muttered over and then you're ready to brave the coat dungeon.
You can buy tickets on-line, and have a confirmation emailed to you.  It is the same price as the local ticket ($18 including photos), you just walk straight to the front of the queue. Hand your booking confirmation and passport to information desk. She will get the ticket office to check your details and issue the tickets.
The queues at the ticket office can be long, and purchasing a ticket online can help you bypass this queue first thing in the morning.  However, at other times the museum can limit the admission rate because of the numbers already in the museum.  In this case having purchased your tickets in advance won't save you as much time.
The museum has a cafe and large shop near the entrance, and numerous small shops throughout the galleries.  Audio guides are available in English, and most signs in the gallery are in English and Russian.  Guide books are available for around 300 rubles.
<br clear="both" />
No trip to St. Petersburg is complete without seeing an opera or ballet performance.  The Mariinsky is perhaps the most well-known institution, but it is by no means the only theater in the city. Tickets are sold throughout the city at kiosks and shops called Teatralnaya Kassa, which charge a nominal (usually about 20 RR) fee for "insurance," which is theoretically optional. The theater box offices themselves sell tickets directly, too, and usually for the same price. Sometimes blocks of tickets sell out at the kiosks but tickets are still available at the theater, or vice versa, so it is worth checking both places if you have your heart set on a particular performance. It is possible to take not-so-small children into some performances if you take a private box, although you will need to ask when you buy your tickets.
<br /> Do not buy your tickets "online". "Online" prices are 10x higher than the actual price and are geared for foreigners who don't know Russian. Example: 10th row seats at the Conservatory's performance of "<i>The Marriage of Figaro</i>" <b>online</b> cost $107, but if you go to the theatre directly a few days before, you pay 500 rubles ($15 US).
The music scene in St. Petersburg is diverse, with several classical, jazz, and pop concerts to choose from each week. Tickets are available at the same Teatralnaya Kassa locations as ballet and opera tickets, although tickets to pop concerts - especially US and European stars on tour - sometimes use exclusive distributors. For pop and rock concerts, unless you buy tickets for the dance floor (tanzpol), you are expected to sit quietly in your seat as if you were at a ballet - ushers are vigilant about keeping the audience from standing up, dancing, or cheering (polite applause is allowed, but that's about all).
Several of the ballet and opera theaters above also offer orchestral and recital performances, so those are not repeated below. Also, don't forget the many small clubs where up and coming bands play.
Most cinemas in St. Petersburg show Hollywood films dubbed in Russian.  Art cinemas like Dom Kino often show independent American or British movies subtitled in Russian. DVDs of American/European films are also often dubbed.  There have been crackdowns on sellers of bootleg DVDs, so it may be difficult or expensive to find DVDs in English these days.  There are several DVD stores in the city - often near Metro stations - and it is worth asking about films in English.
Annual <i>Message to Man</i> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.message-to-man.spb.ru">[37]</a> international documentary, short, and animated films festival takes place in June or July, screening many films in English.
A tour of the canals by boat is a great way to see the city in the summer.  The typical tour is through the Moika, out to the Neva to see the Peter and Paul Fortress and the Cruiser Aurora, then in through the Fontanka (sometimes as far as the Mariinsky Theater).  Tours start at many points along the route and return to their starting point - hawkers for different boat companies abound - and the boats may or may not have a cafe and toilet on board.  Almost all tours are in Russian.  400-600 Rubles seems to be the average price.
The alternative way to explore St Petersburg is to know it from inside, walking and talking with locals and trying local activities. Those people who have lived here for years  would like to tell you a plenty of stories, open some secret places (as roofs or courtyards etc.) and treat you as a friend.
Universities and private schools offer <a href="/en/Russian" title="Russian" class="mw-redirect">Russian</a> language courses (individual and group tuition).
There are plenty of ATMs and legit currency exchange booths. ATM and big shops usually accept the following kinds of cards: <i>Visa, Visa Electron, MasterCard, MasterCard Electronic</i> and <i>Maestro</i>. Other cards (e.g. <i>American Express</i>) are rarely accepted. If you plan on using a US-issued 'stripe-only' card (not a European chip &amp; PIN card), be prepared for it to be a hassle - some places (usually the more touristy locations) will run your card without any trouble, some places will ask you for your passport, and in some places the terminals will randomly either accept your card or insist on a PIN.
Do <i>not</i> exchange money on the street: the rate won't be any better, and you run a high risk of encountering any of numerous <a href="/en/Scams" title="Scams" class="mw-redirect">scams</a>.
Small cornerstores are not necessarily more expensive than larger stores.
The store at the ferry is surprisingly reasonably priced. Souvenirs there can be bought in roubles, dollars, or euros; however, prices vary depending on the currency used. In general, using euros is cheapest.
Churches often have small souvenir/religious shops with a large variety of items.
Nothing, absolutely nothing, tastes better than hot Russian crepes with caviar, mushrooms, caramel, berries, or what have you with a cup of tea on a cold winter street.

The city acts as a beer destination for Moscovites visiting St. Pete for business or vacation reasons--hence its pubs frequently have a much wider choice of beers than an average pub in Moscow (not to mention other cities in Russia). St.Petersburg, being the the fatherland of the most popular beer in Russia - Baltica, is considered the beer capital of the country, while Moscow is more of a Vodka Capital.

Saint Petersburgers know how to party. There is a wide and excellent selection of great clubs that will satisfy all tourists looking to spend the night out. The city hosts clubs of all music. Rock, pop, jazz, hip hop/RnB, and a lot more. The most popular trend within music and clubbing in Russia at the moment is house/techno.
Because of the difficulty in operating gay clubs and the social stigma associated with visiting gay clubs, many young men prefer to use gay iPhone applications like <b>Hornet</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.gethornet.com">[77]</a> and Scruff to arrange to meet at coffee shops and more discrete locations.  This change in technology and the new political issues in St. Petersburg is transforming how gays meet, from nighttime dark watering holes to public straight venues during the day.
Saint-Petersburg has a pub crawl <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.pubcrawls.ru">[78]</a> for both Russian and foreign tourists. The route of the pub crawl takes the guests around the city center, covering about 6 bars in a row. A good way to make friends with locals, not caring about having a list of drinking spots to visit. Be aware of that they won't take you to nice pretty pubs with fruit beer - the bars they visit are pretty hardcore, but they do play some good music and have lots of youth rockin' it.
There are four GSM 900/1800 networks (MTS <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.spb.mts.ru/">[116]</a>, Beeline <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://mobile.beeline.ru/msk/roaming/guests.wbp?part=1">[117]</a>, Megafon <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://szf.megafon.ru/info/eng/tariffes">[118]</a> and Tele2 <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.en.tele2.ru/">[119]</a>) and a CDMA 2000 network (SkyLink <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.skylink.ru/Default.aspx?&amp;r=78">[120]</a>) and the coverage is quite sufficient (every built-up area and most of the country roads). If you stay for a few days or more and need to make local calls it is advised that you buy a pre-paid SIM card (you may be asked for a passport) and a cell-phone if you don't have one matching local standards (possibly a used one) which is going to be much cheaper than roaming in most cases. A SIM card with a balance will cost you less than $10. Cell outlets are plentiful around the city (numerous at every subway station and shopping center). You can pay for your talks at most supermarkets, cell-phone shops and ATMs. The emergency service number is 112.
For international calls, consider buying a calling card which allows very cheap calls (a few rubles for a minute to Europe or the US). Calling from a hotel room may result in rather painful bill.
The following internet cafes offer computers with internet, gaming, and WiFi as noted.
Also there are so-called computer clubs with dozens of computers for network gaming (usually crowded by kids playing CounterStrike) which also offer internet access in separate rooms for a little charge.
Free wifi is available in most hotels, business and shopping centers. In restaurants and pubs, wifi is really everywhere--thanks to huge amount of Finnish tourists that are used to it.
WiMAX (new generation 4G internet) is offered by Yota <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.yota.ru/">[122]</a>, with excellent coverage within city boundaries. 900 rubles/month (or 90 rubles/day). Must buy Yota USB modem (2,390 rubles) to access the 4G network.
Also you can buy a USB-modem with a pre-paid SIM card of any mobile network operators mentioned above. It will cost about 1200 rubles for GSM operators and 3900 rubles for SkyLink. Note that MTS, Beeline and Megafon offer high-speed UMTS interconnection, but Tele2 offers only standard GPRS. Plans start at 1 rub/Mb for GSM operators and 0.30 rub/Mb for SkyLink.

Saint Petersburg has a somewhat undeserved reputation for being a dangerous city. Things have calmed down since the Wild West (or Wild East) days immediately after the collapse of the Soviet Union, but some common sense is still required.
As with most other major cities, avoid traveling alone at night, and do not get into altercations with drunks. If traveling at night, it is recommended to stay on the main sidewalks and avoid any dark alleys or yards.  Gypsy cabs are not recommended under any circumstances, especially those that linger near bars where expatriates and tourists congregate.
<b>Downtown</b>  and <b>western</b> parts of the city are safest. Suburbs like <b>Kupchino</b>, <b>Veteranov</b>  <b>Ligovo</b> and <i>Sennaya</i> in the centre should be avoided at night time.
As a general rule, the farther you are from the city center, the more dangerous it is.
<b>Gangs</b> are a problem, although mafia gang wars are unlikely to affect tourists. Some gangs, however, such as neo-Nazis or angry hooligans, are out looking for problems and commit crimes that can affect tourists. After the war with <a href="/en/Chechnya" title="Chechnya">Chechnya</a> and terrorist attacks in some Russian cities, local hatred is growing toward people with darker complexions, and neo-Nazism is a concern. St. Petersburg, and Russia in general, can be regarded as a seriously dangerous destination for tourists of darker complexions so travelling in groups is highly advised.
Saint Petersburg's football club, Zenit Saint Petersburg, is one of the biggest clubs in the country, and has its own gang of hooligans. If you decide to visit the football stadium to watch the club play, you should buy tickets to center sectors. If you do not do this and a fight starts, you are likely to get dragged into it by either the hooligans or the police, since both will think you are part of the brawl.
Take care of money, documents, cameras, mobile phones, and anything of value because of <b>pickpocketing</b>. Especially watch out on the Metro during busy times, as people start pushing at the train doors, and pickpockets are frequent, particularly (but not only) at <b>Gostinyy Dvor Metro Station</b>.  When riding the Metro, keep in mind that robbery can be a real threat; you should constantly watch what is going on around you and who is standing very close to you.
Thefts of <b>photo equipment</b> are really a big problem in Saint Petersburg. Photo bags probably won't save your camera -- it can be opened in less than 5 seconds. Cameras should be kept in bags slung across the body at all times, with your hands keeping a firm grip on them, and no watches or jewelry should be visible at all. Quite obviously, do not show in public that you have a lot of money. Robberies are not uncommon, and many foreigners have been threatened at <b>gun</b> and <b>knife</b> point.  However, foreigners are not targeted specifically, and robbers will attack both foreigners and natives that carelessly reveal their wealth.
Take special care on <b>Nevsky Prospekt</b>, particularly the area with the city tour buses, a favorite spot of pickpockets and particularly of those after photo equipment. On the bright side, "Nevsky Prospekt" sees little mugging.
Russian driving is <i>wild</i>. Drivers attack their art with an equal mix of aggressiveness and incompetence. Guidelines are lax and rarely followed. As a pedestrian, take great care when crossing the roads, as pedestrian crossings are in 99% of cases ignored (even by police). If you are thinking of driving yourself, bear in mind that the Russian traffic police are extremely corrupt, even by Russian standards. Pedestrian crossings with a traffic light are quite safe to use, most car drivers will stop. Just like in any other big city always look left and right  before crossing the road and make eye contact with the driver if possible.
Saint Petersburg has a relatively big problem with <b>street children</b> who make their living out of stealing. They can be a hassle and can beg you aggressively. Act like any other Russian would: say no, then just ignore them and go away.
<b>Homosexuals</b> must practice extreme caution while staying in Saint Petersburg, as attacks often occur. Many Russian people look upon public demonstrations of homosexuality with undisguised contempt.
<b>Racism</b> is another serious problem in Saint Petersburg. Some Russians may have rude and unfriedmly attituee to those wih darker complexion. Some may even have physical touch against you (e.g. Push you aside).
<b>Bar fights</b> do occur. In the center of the city and around <b>Nevsky Prospekt</b>, they are unlikely to happen. However, in the suburbs and local cheaper pubs, fights occur almost daily. If you are staying with locals living in these areas, it might be a good idea to avoid these bars. Police are unlikely to show up as they consider fights as small, unimportant, regular and a waste of time, and they will probably laugh at you for calling.
Another subtle danger that can affect your trip is the inevitable effect of winter weather. Poor harvesting of snow and ice is a big problem in city. Caution is advised in snowy winters because of falling ice from roofs, and pedestrians should pay special attention to ice on the streets.
Overall, be warned that if you are used to living in the US and/or Western Europe, Saint Petersburg, as well as the rest of Eastern Europe, will seem different, and, at times, a bit intimidating. On the other hand, Russian people are usually friendly, welcoming and interested towards foreigners, and nothing should happen to you unless you put yourself in harm's way. If you don't care about them they don't care about you, and nothing should get in your way of having a great holiday.
The below private hospitals have English-speaking Russian doctors (very few, if any, hospital staff are expats).  Depending on the type of service provided and the terms of one's insurance policy, these hospitals may be able to arrange direct billing with European and American medical insurance companies.
The city's water-system is not ideal because of a number of old pipes and as a result does not provide 100% clean water. Some locals boil or also filter tap water before use; you might want to buy it bottled if water quality affects you.
In Saint Petersburg cold water is cleaner than hot, also there isn't hot water for 3 weeks every summer.
There are numerous public toilets, most of which are attended by a person who will charge about 15 rubles for entry. It is a good idea to take your own toilet paper, as it is not always provided. The toilets are typically extremely dirty by Western standards. If you are a Westerner, you can get away with wandering into the Western hotels, which have lovely bathrooms&#8212; the Grand Hotel Europe in particular. Just don't ever push your luck with suit-clad men guarding the hotel entrances, they are tough as nails if provoked. Many restaurants also allow tourists to use toilet without being a customer.
The first 24 hours in Saint Petersburg may be a shock to the system. The welcome from immigration officials seems like a hang-over from Communist times- don't expect to be spoken to or even looked at by officials. Flying into Saint Petersburg may seem unusual, with the sight of old concrete tower blocks and factory chimneys. The suburbs of the city are a contrast to those with which you may be familiar. Nevsky Prospekt is the most 'Westernized' street in the city and would be more familiar to Westerners traveling to Saint Petersburg. If you are from a Western country, you will find this either shocking or amusing.
Saint Petersburg is plagued by mosquitoes during the summer, as the swampy surroundings of the city give the mosquitoes excellent living conditions. In budget accommodation with few countermeasures against the mosquitoes, this can be a problem at night, putting your well deserved sleep at risk.
One-day excursions are popular with travellers to Saint Petersburg. Taxicabs and buses are the most common forms of transport and trips can often be organised either with the holiday operator e.g. Intourist, before traveling to <a href="/en/Russia" title="Russia">Russia</a>, or from your hotel. Several tour bus companies have kiosks in front of Gostinyy Dvor, with some tours (but not all) offered in English. Some of the most popular excursions include:
