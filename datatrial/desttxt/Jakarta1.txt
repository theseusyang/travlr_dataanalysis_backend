<b>Jakarta</b> is the capital and largest city of <a href="/en/Indonesia" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>, located on the northwest of the island of <a href="/en/Java" title="Java">Java</a>. Jakarta is the country's economic, cultural and political centre and the most populous city not only in Indonesia but in Southeast Asia as a whole.
Despite of the heavy traffic and heavy  pollution the city is filled with exciting nightlife and vibrant shopping areas. The city is also the centre and melting pot of Indonesian culture which might be the thing for you to enjoy Jakarta.
One excellent surprise you'll find in Jakarta is that once you past the taxi drivers who offer their services at the airport and really meet the locals, you will find that the people are among the most friendly, hospitable, and helpful people you'll find on earth, if you keep away from the midi-bus drivers who are notorious for being the harshest on earth. However, understand that Jakarta being a melting pot, you are guaranteed to meet people from all sorts of characters.
<b>Jakarta</b> is administratively divided into the following named districts(note that these district except central Jakarta are very dense in terms of area):
<b>Satellite cities</b>: The Jabotabek mega-city of 30 million includes Jakarta and the following satellite cities:
Jakarta may initially seem a bit overwhelming, but if you can overlook the pollution and indulge in her charms, you can discover what is also one of Asia's most exciting, most lively cities.  There is plenty to do in Jakarta, from <b>cosmopolitan shopping</b> at the many luxurious shopping centres to one of the hippest <b>nightlife scenes</b> in Southeast Asia.
When you arrive at city, you will feel the 'heavy' air fills your lung. Jakarta being where it is, the humidity level can be as awful as &gt;80%. This is what causes most of the discomfort. Expect to sweat and feel tired more easily when you are at the city, but the good news is: Your skin will be better-moisturized. Just make sure that you wear 100% cotton clothing up to your arm for maximum comfort.
The port of <b>Sunda Kelapa</b> dates to the 12th century, when it served the Sundanese kingdom of Pajajaran near present-day <a href="/en/Bogor" title="Bogor">Bogor</a>.  The first Europeans to arrive were the Portuguese, who were given the permission by the Hindu Kingdom of Pakuan Pajajaran to erect a godown in 1522.  Control was still firmly in local hands, and in 1527 the city was conquered by <b>Prince Fatahillah</b>, a Muslim prince from <a href="/en/Cirebon" title="Cirebon">Cirebon</a>, who changed the name to <b>Jayakarta</b>.
By the end of the 16th century, however, the <b>Dutch</b> (led by Jan Pieterszoon Coen) had pretty much taken over the port city, and the razing of a competing English fort in 1619 secured their hold on the island of Java. The Dutch razed the old Jayakarta port during their conquest and rebuilt the town with dutch style of town planning, fort and canals. Under the name <b>Batavia</b>, the new Dutch town became the capital of the Dutch East Indies and was known as the <i>Queen of the East</i>.
During these times the town flourishes as the center of the Dutch East Indies Trading Company and grow radpidly, and during this time as well that Chinese and Eurasian population grew within the city. In order to keep order and control the Dutch banned the native Javanese to live within the walled part of the city while encouraging Chinese immigrant to flock the commercial walled city with its canal. It is also known that after the Dutch conquest of Malacca, Significant number of Portuguese decent people from Malacca were taken as captive to Batavia and they live in area called "Kampung Tugu".
The old Batavia which were planned in Dutch planning and canal were not doing so well, in fact the canal itself became breeding ground for mosquitoes. The city centre became unhealthy and filthy and the city were nicknamed "The Cemetry of the Europeans, this is also the reason why the city grew more in land.
In 1740, Chinese slaves rebelled against the Dutch. The rebellion was put down harshly with the massacre of thousands of Chinese slaves. The remaining Chinese slaves were exiled to Sri Lanka.
In 1795, the Netherlands were invaded and occupied by France, and on March 17, 1798, the <b>Batavian Republic</b>, a satellite state of France, took over both VOC debts and assets.  But on August 26, 1811, a British expedition led by Lord Minto defeated the French/Dutch troops in Jakarta, leading to a brief liberation and subsequent administration of Indonesia by the British (led by Sir Stamford Raffles of <a href="/en/Singapore" title="Singapore">Singapore</a> fame) in 1811-1816.  In 1815, after the Congress of Vienna, Indonesia was officially handed over from the British to the Dutch government.
In the early 1800s most canals were filled in, the town was shifted 4 km inland and the <i>Pearl of the Orient</i> flourished once again.
In the 18th century, more than 60% of Batavia's population consisted of slaves working for the VOC. The slaves were mostly engaged to undertake housework, while working and living conditions were generally reasonable.[citation needed] Laws were enacted that protected slaves against overly-cruel actions from their masters; for example, Christian slaves were given freedom after the death of their masters, while some slaves were allowed to own a store and made money to buy their freedom. Sometimes, slaves fled and established gangs that would roam throughout the area.
From the beginning of the VOC establishment in Batavia, until the colony became a fully-fledged town, the population of Batavia grew tremendously. At the beginning, Batavia consisted of approximately 50,000 inhabitants and, by the second half of the 19th century, Batavia consisted of 800,000 inhabitants. By the end of the VOC rule of Batavia, the population of Batavia had reached one million.
The name <b>Jakarta</b> was adopted as a short form of Jayakarta when the city was taken over by the Japanese in 1942.   After the second world war, the Indonesian Declared their independence in koningsplein which is today's Merdeka Square. The Indonesian war of independence followed after the second world war, with the capital briefly shifted to <a href="/en/Yogyakarta" title="Yogyakarta">Yogyakarta</a> after the Dutch attacked.  The war lasted until 1949, when the Dutch accepted Indonesian independence and handed back the town, which became Indonesia's capital again.
Since independence Jakarta's population has skyrocketed, thanks to migrants coming to the city in search of (illusive) wealth. The entire <b>Jabotabek</b> (Jakarta-<a href="/en/Bogor" title="Bogor">Bogor</a>-<a href="/en/Tangerang" title="Tangerang">Tangerang</a>-<a href="/en/Bekasi" title="Bekasi">Bekasi</a>-<a href="/en/Depok" title="Depok">Depok</a>) metropolitan region (now officially <i>Jabodetabekjur</i> last census count (2010) was 28 million people, a figure projected to have hit 30 million already.  The official name of the city is <b>Daerah Khusus Ibukota Jakarta Raya</b> (<b>DKI Jakarta</b>), meaning "Special Capital City Region".
<b>Departure taxes</b><br />
As of March 2009, Soekarno-Hatta Airport charges departure taxes of Rp 150,000 (US$17) for international flights and Rp 40,000 (US$4.50) for domestic flights, payable in cash only.  Foreign currencies <i>may</i> be accepted, but it's better to leave enough rupiah to pay; forgetting this could be very awkward!
<b>Soekarno Hatta International Airport</b> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IATA" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:IATA">IATA</a>: <b>CGK</b>; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICAO" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:ICAO">ICAO</a>: <b>WIII</b>), <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.soekarno-hatta-airport.com">[1]</a> at <a href="/en/Tangerang" title="Tangerang">Tangerang</a>, Banten. All international and nearly all domestic flights land here 20 km (12 mi) to the northwest of the city.  The counterintuitive airport code comes from <i>Cengkareng</i>, a district near the airport. During the rainy season the road to and from Cengkareng was prone to flooding but this problem has now been alleviated with the building of an additional raised, dual carriageway, toll road between the city and Cengkareng. If you don't have non-stop options between your origin city and Jakarta, try connecting via Singapore or Kuala Lumpur as there are more than a dozen flights a day between these cities and Jakarta.
The Soekarno Hatta airport has <b>three terminals</b>, further split up into sub-terminals, which are really just halls in the same building:
A <b>free but unreliable shuttle bus</b> runs between the terminals; if you're in a hurry, it's a safer bet to take a taxi, although they may ask for a rather steep Rp 50,000 for the service (not entirely unjustified, as half of this goes to paying their parking fees), however it should really be a metered ride. If you have time, though, it's not a problem to wait for the next one - just ask the airport staff where it stops and what it looks like (yellow color, normally). Also, be sure to know which terminal you will disembark from.
Visas on arrival (<i>VoA</i>) are available at the airport, see the main <a href="/en/Indonesia" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a> article for the details of the rules.  If possible, provide an exact payment of US$25 and ignore any requests for any additional <i>fees</i>. ATMs and currency exchange services are available in the baggage claim hall, and Terminal D has a left luggage service. The Visa on Arrival is payable in cash or by a credit card. The nearest ATM is past the customs area, so if you don't have cash, you will need to be escorted to the ATM and back. Although it is possible to pay for a  VoA using my credit/debit card it is a slower process and may not be available at times, so cash is best. Please also remember to carry exact change as sometimes the officials may cause problems. Sometimes immigration officers may ask for a bribe to provide you with a visa. Please avoid paying this bribe as you'll have to pay another one while leaving the country. Also it is good to note that even at the airport hardly anyone speaks fluent English here.
Be cautious of having any involvement or contact with the baggage porters, the greater majority of them are committed scamsters and they often attempt to obtain money by cheating and misleading passengers. They should be paid minum Rp 20,000 to carry bags but that is best avoided, seek out a trolley and deal with it yourself.
Exchange rates in the airport are not significantly worse than the centre of town and better than you will get from hotels. Bear in mind that you will need some cash and Jakarta is not a place where you can just stroll down to the nearest bank in town as it is pedestrian unfriendly. ATMs generally have limit of Rp 1-3 million per transaction; for the latter, try CIMB or bii-Maybank - in the international terminal, there are several of these on the second (departure) floor.
If you are taking a domestic flight from Soekarno Hatta, you can enjoy cheap airport lounges.  There are several private lounges open to travellers on any airline that are in stiff competition with each other.  For Rp 50,000, you can get a few hours in one of these lounges where you can relax on the comfy couches, eat and drink as much as you want and use the internet (either by wifi or through their computers).
Please note that when leaving Jakarta via the airport, you need to pay an additional RP 150,000 airport tax at the departure check in. Your prepaid flight tickets do not include this. The check in staff will issue you with a receipt thereafter.
For overnight transits, there are a few hotels near the airport:
The older <b>Halim Perdanakusuma Airport</b> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IATA" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:IATA">IATA</a>: <b>HLP</b>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICAO" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:ICAO">ICAO</a>: <b>WIHH</b>), to the southeast of the city, is used by the military, VIP flights, charter flights, sea planes, helicopter leasing companies and private jets.
To get to the city, the easiest option is to contact your hotel to pick you up in the airport, as <b>many hotels in Jakarta provide free airport transfers</b>. Getting a taxi is a little more complicated.
All taxis use meters (<i>argo</i>), yet some touted taxi may insist on not using meters and charging inflated fix price (<i>borongan</i>), visitors should avoid this scam. Passengers are responsible for paying roadway tolls, prices are posted at the toll booths and a receipt is given. The airport has a docket system for payment of an airport surcharge in addition to the normal taxi metered charge. It is detailed on the docket and is determined by destination distance. You are asked for your destination when arriving at the taxi rank and the docket is issued accordingly when you are assigned a taxi. If you do not make it clear that you require a taxi you may not be assigned one. Usually, taxi staff are uniformed. If someone offers you a taxi and they are not wearing the same uniform as the taxi company drivers then you are well advised to ignore them. Some of the uniformed taxi brokers are involved in a scam of telling foreign tourists about a high minimum payment for short trips. They receive a kickback from the drivers for setting tourists up to overpay.
An <b>economical alternative</b> is the frequent <b>DAMRI</b> shuttle buses (15 min to 40 min between buses, depending on route and time) which connect to numerous Jakarta destinations; Gambir (the most appropriate for those going to Jalan Jaksa and Central Jakarta area), Rawamangun, Blok M, Tanjung Priok, Kampung Rambutan (for Depok), Pasar Minggu, Lebak Bulus and Kemayoran (Rp 25,000) as well as directly to the neighboring cities of <a href="/en/Bekasi" title="Bekasi">Bekasi</a>, <a href="/en/Serang" title="Serang">Serang</a> (Rp 30,000), <a href="/en/Bogor" title="Bogor">Bogor</a> and <a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Cikarang&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Cikarang (page does not exist)">Cikarang</a> (Rp 35,000). The bus service from the airport operates until midnight (despite what taxi touts may say to you). It is reliable, comfortable and air-conditioned. You can get the tickets in the many counters after the airport exit.
If arriving by an international flight at Terminal 2, head to the left after going out of the building until you see <b>DAMRI</b> ticket booths and bus stops. In terminal 3, the bus stop is in front of it just behind taxi ranks. Note that DAMRI service <b>to</b> the airport shuts down <b>much</b> earlier - for example, the bus from Gambir operates from 3.30am to 7.30pm. From Terminal 1 (domestic), just cross the taxi stop, the bus stop is on the other side of the road (signs read <i>Shelter Bus</i>).
<b>Damri</b> buses operate from 4 a.m. (<a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Time_in_Indonesia&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Time in Indonesia (page does not exist)">Western Indonesia Standard Time</a>) to 7 p.m. from the city, and to midnight from the airport. Buses stop to pick up passengers at departure areas in all terminals. All buses use the Prof. Dr. Sedyatmo Toll Road. Travel time to and from the centre of Jakarta to the Gambir railway station takes around 70 minutes (sometimes longer), depending on traffic. Buses to the airport leave from the various terminals in central Jakarta (Gambir) and surrounding areas (It may vary depend on traffic).
<br />
Information about train tickets from PT Kereta Api (Persero) is available on the Web (kereta-api.co.id for easier booking). In Jakarta, you can buy your tickets in the major stations up to 90 days in advance or you can log in on its website to get code booking and pay either in the stations or many Indomaret and Alfamart stores with no additional fee, certainly you can go directly to the stores to buy ticket without code booking. In the stations beware of ticket touts! They will offer their wares even to people waiting in the queues in front of the ticket sales points. You should expect to pay 50-100% more if you do so, and you could find that your coach hasn't any empty seats anyway. The safest and nicer way is online booking and then go to the stores.
Most travel agents will also be happy to sell you train tickets to any destination. Simply order the tickets, pay (preferably) in cash and later in the day they will be delivered to your hotel.
Jakarta has several train stations.
The current main station for long distance passengers in Jakarta is the <b>Gambir</b> station, located in Central Jakarta, just east of the <b>Monas</b>. <b>Eksekutif</b> (AC) and some <b>bisnis</b> (non-AC) class trains arrive at this station.
Most trains from big cities in Java (<a href="/en/Purwokerto" title="Purwokerto">Purwokerto</a>, <a href="/en/Yogyakarta" title="Yogyakarta">Yogyakarta</a>, <a href="/en/Solo" title="Solo">Solo</a>, <a href="/en/Semarang" title="Semarang">Semarang</a>, <a href="/en/Malang" title="Malang">Malang</a> and <a href="/en/Surabaya" title="Surabaya">Surabaya</a>) arrive in late afternoon or evening.
An airport bus service connects Soekarno-Hatta International Airport with Gambir station.
Cheaper trains without air-conditioning generally use the <b>Pasar Senen</b> station located two blocks east of Gambir. Beware that the location is rife with crime, although the station itself has been spruced up recently. Anyway, these <b>ekonomi</b> trains are not really suggested for tourist travel: they are slow and poor facilities.
Most trains arriving in Jakarta also stop at <b>Jatinegara</b> station in the eastern part of the city, giving better access to the eastern and southern parts of the city.
<b>Jakarta Kota</b> station is located in the old part of the city, and serves as the departure point for commuter trains and some trains to <a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Merak&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Merak (page does not exist)">Merak</a>. It is an interesting Art Deco style building that is currently being restored.
Passengers from other cities arrive in bus terminals such as <b>Rawamangun</b> (East Jakarta) <b>Kampung Rambutan</b> (Southeast Jakarta), <b>Pulo Gadung</b> (East Jakarta), <b>Kali Deres</b> (West Jakarta) or <b>Lebak Bulus</b> (South Jakarta).  You'll need to speak at least functional Indonesian to manage, and the terminals are notorious for muggers and pickpockets, so observe the safety precautions under <a href="#Stay_safe">#Stay safe</a>.
The national ferry company, PELNI, and other sealines, operate passenger services to destinations across the archipelago from Tanjung Priok port in the North of the city.  Some smaller speedboats, particularly to the Thousand Islands (Pulau Seribu), depart from <b>Ancol</b> also on Jakarta's north shore.
<b>How to speak <i>prokem</i> like a <i>Betawi</i></b><br />
The everyday speech of Jakartans (<i>Betawi</i>) is liberally laced with slang (<i>prokem</i>) expressions.  Like any slang, words come in and out of fashion with bewildering rapidity, but some features can be distinguished:
A short glossary of common Jakartan expressions:
Getting around Jakarta is a problem. The city layout is chaotic and totally bewildering, traffic is indisputably the worst in South-East Asia with horrendous traffic jams (<i>macet</i> "MAH-chet") slowing the city to a crawl during rush hours (several hours in the morning and in the evening), and the current railway system (Jabodetabek Commuter Line) is better and better made more executives (more than 30 percent) use the train instead of the car or motorcycle as before to Jakarta (convinience park and ride are available in certain stations). The commuter line authority will add more train to lure more executives. The construction of a monorail system in Golden Triangle, started in 2004, soon ground to a halt over political infighting, but in June 2013 other consortium has initialized the project and groundbreaking has done on October 16, 2013. The green line is circular around Golden Triangle up to Palmerah and Casablanca and predicted will be operated in 3 years ahead, while the blue line is across the green line and spread between Kampung Melayu to Roxy v.v. and predicted will be operated in 4 years ahead. Some State Company owners consortium including Jasa Marga the toll road operator will also make monorail between Bekasi and Jakarta use a part of toll road land and the first monorail is predicted will run in 2016. The gradually expanding <b>Transjakarta Busway</b> (Bus Rapid Transit) system helps to make things easier (Rp3,500 for all routes and you can move from one to the others routes whichever you like), but this is not enough for the biggest city in the world without rail rapid transit system. The first line of Jakarta MRT Phase I between Lebak Bulus and Hotel Indonesia Circle has made groundbreaking on October 10, 2013 and scheduled to open in Q1 2018, a bit later than the first schedule because material mobilizations is done in the night and after midnigt only begin at 10p.m. to avoid traffic jam.
Various areas of the city have different levels of chaos. The most well organised traffic is only at Golden Triangle (MH Thamrin, Jendral Sudirman, and H.R.Rasuna Said.) Recently, new housing complexes also have good traffic too.
Commuter trains in Jakarta connect the city centre with outlying regions, namely <a href="/en/Tangerang" title="Tangerang">Tangerang</a>, <a href="/en/Bekasi" title="Bekasi">Bekasi</a>, <a href="/en/Depok" title="Depok">Depok</a>, <a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Bojonggede&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Bojonggede (page does not exist)">Bojonggede</a>, <a href="/en/Bogor" title="Bogor">Bogor</a> and <a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Serpong&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Serpong (page does not exist)">Serpong</a>.
Commuter services operate from 5AM (first train departing Bogor to Jakarta) to almost 10PM (last train leaving Jakarta for Bogor). Trains often run late, though. Weekend special services connect Depok and Bogor with the popular <a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Ancol&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Ancol (page does not exist)">Ancol</a> entertainment park in Jakarta.
With subsidize from government, since July 1, 2013 the commuter train ticket is cheaper with up to 5 stations is only Rp2,000 and then for additional  every 3 consecutive stations is only Rp500. Government wants to attract other moda passengers to use trains. E-ticket is implented with closed system and who are not tap when someone in will be charge for the longest route fare. No more economy non-AC train, all with AC and trains will be added continuously to accomodate the passengers. People who are sitting on the roof is limited or no more. Vendor stalls in the stations have been demolished to create steril area in the stations.
It is best not to carry valuables on the train, but if you do, keep then secure, and preferably in front of you. Wallets kept in the hip pocket are vulnerable.
Commuter services operate over these lines:
Station names written with CAPITALS are regular express stops. Several express trains (and semi-express trains) stop at other stations only at certain times outside the rush hours. All trains other than the expresses <b>do not</b> stop at Gambir station, the main station in Jakarta, so this might be a problem for those arriving from other regions and wanting to continue to other stations. The choice is to take an express train to the nearest station and continuing by other forms of transport, or taking a taxi to Juanda station, located a few hundred meters north of Gambir, close enough if you wish to walk. If coming from Jalan Jaksa area, another option is just to walk to Gondangdia (next one south of Gambir) station, it's just 5-10 minutes walk to the left from the southern end of Jaksa.
<br />
This site <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.krl.co.id/Info-Jadwal-KA-Commuter.html">[4]</a> provide Time Table for Commuter and Ekonomi class (expect some delay) for long route. For your information, since 5 December 2011 there are change in commuter train route <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.krl.co.id/peta-rute-loopline.html">[5]</a>
Remember there are no ekonomi class anymore for commuter lines.
Riding the <i>ekonomi</i> class outsides the commuter lines is not advisable: crime and sexual harassment are known to happen inside packed trains (during rush hours some people even travel on the roof, despite the obvious danger of overhead wires!). During the non-rush hours, though, economy train travel is quite an interesting experience. It is a tour of Jakarta's darker side, with peddlers offering every imaginable article (from safety pins to cell-phone starter kits), various sorts of entertainment, ranging from one-person orchestras to full-sized bands, and a chance to sample real poverty; you are riding a slum on wheels. Just remember to keep an eye on your belongings all the time, do not flash valuables if you have any, and, if you have a bag, hold it in front of you (that's what many locals also do in these trains).
The Transjakarta Busway (in Indonesian known as <i>busway</i> or <i>TJ</i>) is modern, air-conditioned and generally comfortable, although sometimes service can be spotty (they have a knack of going to the depot for service and refueling at the same time during the rush hours).  Do note that the bus service is quite unreliable resulting in waiting time for a bus up to 1 hour especially during rush hours. There are twelve lines operational as of mid-February 2013.
The other three corridors will be finished before end of 2016.
The transfer points for the Transjakarta Busway lines are:
Unlike Jakarta's other buses, busway buses shuttle on fully dedicated lanes and passengers must use dedicated stations with automatic doors, usually found in the middle of large thoroughfares connected to both sides by overhead bridges.  The system is remarkably user-friendly by Jakartan standards, with station announcements and an LED display inside the purpose-built vehicles. Grab onto a handle as soon as you enter the bus as they move away from the stop suddenly and quickly.
Park and Ride facilities are in Ragunan, South Jakarta, Kampung Rambutan, East Jakarta and Kalideres, West Jakarta and in late 2010 the city administration was holding a tender for the construction of Park and Ride facilities in Pulo Gebang, East Jakarta. That construction of that facility is planned to start in 2011.
Buses run from 5AM-10PM daily.  Tickets cost a flat Rp 2,000 before 7AM, and Rp 3,500 after. Transfers between lines are free be careful not to exit the system until your journey is completed. The hub at Harmoni station is the busiest interchange. The buses can get very crowded, especially during rush hours at 7AM and 4PM, when office workers are on the move. If you have an iPhone or iPod touch, a Transjakarta Application map is also available to download. As of May 2009, the application is <b>free</b>. For blackberry users a <i>Transjakarta Guide for Blackberry</i> software download<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.max-studio.net/TransJakarta.jad">[6]</a> is available.
It's advisable to refrain from using other buses for intracity travel; stick with taxis as they are safer. If you're feeling adventurous, as of July 2013 the flat fare for regular buses is Rp 3,000, while air conditioned buses (Mayasari or Patas AC) cost Rp 6,000 to 7,000.  Some buses have a box at the front next to the driver where you can pay your fares, while others employ a man or a <i>kondektur</i> who will personally collect the fares from passengers.
Cheaper yet are <i>mikrolet</i> (mini-buses) and <i>angkot</i> (small vans) that ply the smaller streets and whose fares vary from Rp 3,000 to 6,000 depending on the distance, but good luck figuring out the routes.  You pay the fare directly to the driver after getting off.
You may need to spare one or two Rp 500 coins before boarding the bus, since there is on-board "entertainment" and other distractions. On a typical day, you may find street musicians singing unplugged versions of Indonesian and Western pop songs asking for donations at the end of the performance, and street vendors, one after another, trying to sell almost everything, from ballpoint pens and candies to boxed donuts and health goods. 
If you do happen to be travelling in a bus, refrain from sitting or standing at the back area of the bus as this is where muggers find their prey.  Always keep an eye on your belongings and be alert at all times as pickpocketing occurs.
Note that buses do not run according to any schedule or timetable. Sometimes a bus may take a while to come,in other circumstances it is possible that two of the same bus routes may come together and these drivers will definitely drive aggressively to get more passengers. They do not stop at any particular bus stop and can stop just about anywhere they like. If you want to get off, simply say "kiri" (to the left) to the "kondektur" or just knock on the ceiling of the bus for three times (be sure that the driver hears your thumping), and the bus driver will find a place to drop you. An additional tip to alight from these buses is to use your left foot first to maintain balance and try to get down as quickly as possible as they do not fully stop the bus.
Also note that seats in these buses are built for Indonesians who are typically shorter and more slender and agile than people with a larger build such as Caucasians and Africans. Non-Indonesians might find the seats in these buses to be confining and uncomfortable.
List of bus terminals in Jakarta: Blok M (South Jakarta), Lebak Bulus (South Jakarta), Pasar Minggu (South Jakarta), Grogol, Kota, Kalideres (West Jakarta), Manggarai (South Jakarta), Pulogadung (East Jakarta), Rawamangun (East Jakarta), Kampung Melayu (East Jakarta), Kampung Rambutan (South Jakarta), Tanjung Priok (North Jakarta), Senen (Central Jakarta).
Rental cars are available, but unless you are familiar with local driving practices or lack thereof, take reputable taxis.  If you're from a foreign country, it is not recommended to rent a car and drive on your own. The chaotic and no-rules traffic will certainly give you a headache. Renting a car with a driver is a much better idea.
The price of fuel in Indonesia is relatively low due to the application of subsidies by the central government. Pertamina outlets supply gasoline (<i>bensin</i>) (<i>petrol</i>) at Rp 6.500/litre, diesel fuel (solar) is at Rp 5,500/litre. Non-subsidised prices for products such as Pertamax (RON 92 Pertamax high-octane gasoline are higher at around Rp 9,500/litre, RON 95 Pertamax Plus around Rp 10,350 and Pertamina-Dex (diesel fuel) is around Rp 10,100. Prices at outlets operated by Shell, Mobil and Petronas are similar.
Toll roads circle the city and are faster when the traffic is good, but are very often jammed themselves. The drainage systems of major roads are poorly maintained and during the rainy season from Dec-Feb major roads may be flooded, leading to even worst traffic congestion than normal.
Finding parking places in residential areas can be difficult due to the narrow roads.  Paid parking is easy to find in shopping malls, offices and the like is Rp 3,000 to 4,000/hr. Street parking often requires to payment of Rp 3,000 to a parking 'attendant'.
If you do decide to drive by yourself or having a driver in Jakarta, please remember that there is a <b>3-in-1 system</b> implemented in some of the main roads in the morning from 7.00-10AM and in the afternoon from 4.30-7 PM, this requires a a car to have a minimum of three occupants. The routes include the whole stretch from Kota train station through Blok M via Jl. Hayam Wuruk, Jl. Thamrin, Jl. Sudirman and Jl.Sisingamangaraja; Jl. Gatot Subroto from the Senayan-JCC overpass to the intersection with Jl. HR Rasuna Said. However, complying with the 3-in-1 rule is as simple as picking up a "<b>jockey</b>". Along the main roads are many who look like hitch hikers, but they are in fact "jockies" who charge a small fee to make up the number in your car. Pay the "jockey" Rp 20 to 25,000 for the service, depending on the distance. There are intentions from the local government to change this system to an Electronic Road Pricing system sometime in the future.
<b>Beware the false Blue Bird</b><br />
Blue Bird's reputation has spawned a host of dodgy imitators, so just because it's blue doesn't mean it's safe.  Check the following before you get in:
The growing reputation of Express taxis has also led to a number of imitation companies popping up in recent years, take the same precautions as you would for spotting a fake Blue Bird
<br />
Most visitors opt to travel by taxi, which is cheap and occasionally even fast.  There are a multitude of taxi companies of varying degrees of dependability. Taxis are widely available and usually easily hailed off the street in a matter of seconds however demand often exceeds supply during periods of heavy rain and weekday peak hours (generally about 4:30-8:00PM). If you absolutely need to be somewhere during rush hour (i.e. the airport) it is a good idea to make alternative transportation arrangements.
The Blue Bird group â+62 21 79171234, (24 hr) is known for their reliability, has an efficient telephone order service and always uses their meter. Fares are Rp 6,000 flagfall (including the first kilometer) and Rp 300 for every subsequent 100 meters or minute stuck in traffic.
Alternatively the Express group â+62 21 26509000, is fast overtaking Blue Bird's reputation as best taxi firm in Jakarta. Unlike Blue Bird, Express requires a minimum of three years' experience at another Jakarta taxi firm from its drivers. As a result, Express drivers generally know their way around the city better than the often newly arrived Blue Bird drivers. Metered fares are slightly cheaper too at Rp 5,000 flagfall (including the first kilometer)and Rp 250 for every subsequent 100 meters or minute stuck in traffic.
Some other large, generally reliable companies include Taxiku, Gamya, Dian Taksi, Putra and TransCab.  You can generally determine a good cabbie by asking "<i>argo?</i>" ("meter?") - if they say no or "tidak", get another taxi.
Taxis parked near train/bus stations, tourist attractions, and hotels often refuse to use the meter and quote silly prices (especially from foreigners) - in this case, it's a good idea to walk away a bit, then hail a passing Blue Bird or Express taxi.
Many taxis are mechanically unsound and have drivers of highly questionable skill. They also often engage in determined efforts to overcharge, including via rigged meters. There have been occasional but recent cases of people being robbed at knife-point after taking non-reputable taxis, so it's best to stick to the firms above. Be particularly vigilant late at night, when you will spot a number of taxis from firms you have never heard of or seen before roaming around.
Rates for Taxis depend on the company, though most use the "Tarif Bawah"  rate of Rp 5,000 flagfall (including the first kilometer) and Rp 250 for every subsequent 100 meters or one minute stuck in traffic. Blue Bird group and a handful of other companies charge Rp 6,000 flagfall (including the first kilometer) and Rp 300 for every subsequent 100 meters or one minute stuck in traffic. Minimum charges apply to taxis ordered by phone, this should be posted on the inside of the taxi and generally varies from Rp 20,000-Rp 30,000. No minimum applies to taxis flagged off the side of the road or taken from ranks though drivers may be upset if you give them less than Rp 10,000.
Carry plenty of small denomination notes to pay fares as there is no guarantee that drivers will have any change. On the meter, fares are rounded up to the nearest Rp 1,000 as a matter of course and tips are generally expected from foreigners, though by no means mandatory. When paying, it is usual to round up to the nearest Rp 10,000. On a longer trip, if the service has been good, allow 10% for the tip and again, round up to the nearest Rp 10,000.
Keep the doors locked and the windows closed when travelling in a taxi, as luxury items or a bag can be an attractive target when stuck in a traffic jam or traffic light.  Avoid using the smaller taxi companies especially if you are alone, and try to know the vague route - the driver might well take you a roundabout route to avoid traffic, but you will know the general direction. Stating your direction clearly and confidently will usually pre-empt any temptation to take you on the long route. It is also not uncommon for taxi drivers to be recent arrivals in Jakarta - they often don't know their way around and may be relying on you to direct them - ensure that they know the way before you get in.
Another solution for getting around in Jakarta is to rent a car. However for most visitors it is best to use a local driver rather than self drive.

The Jakartan equivalent to <a href="/en/Thailand" title="Thailand">Thailand</a>'s tuk-tuk is the <b>bajaj</b> (pronounced "bahdge-eye"), orange mutant scooters souped up in India into tricycles that carry passengers in a small cabin at the back.
They're a popular way to get around town since they can weave through Jakarta's interminable traffic jams much like motorbikes can. Although slow, boneshaking (suspension is not a feature in a bajaj), hot (locals joke about the "natural A/C") and the quick way to breathing in more exhaust fumes than you ever thought possible, riding around in these little motor-bugs can really grow on you. The old version 2 cycles of Bajaj is gradually being changed by CNG version which eco-friendly, quieter and more convinience for your bone.
There are no set prices, but a short hop of a few city blocks shouldn't cost much more than Rp 5,000.  Be sure to agree to (read: <a href="/en/Haggle" title="Haggle" class="mw-redirect">haggle</a>) a price before you set off.  Bajaj drivers are happy to overcharge visitors, and can often ask double or even more of what you would pay by meter in air-conditioned Blue Bird taxi (obviously, the normal price should be less than even for a cheaper variety of taxi).  Locals who regularly use the bajaj know what a typical fare should be and are happy to tell you.  Also, since bajaj aren't allowed on some of the larger roads in Jakarta, your route may well take you through the bewildering warren of backstreets. Try to keep an eye on what direction you're going, because some unscrupulous bajaj drivers see nothing wrong with taking the "scenic" route and then charging you double or triple the price.
If you're poking around narrow back streets, or just in such a hurry that you're willing to lose a limb or more to get there, then Jakarta's motorcycle taxis (<i>ojek</i>) might be the ticket for you.  Jakarta's ojek services consist of guys with bikes lounging around street corners, who usually shuttle short distances down alleys and roads but will also do longer trips for a price.  Agree on the fare before you set off. And insist on a helmet, and wear it properly. No need to make it more insanely dangerous than it already is. The ojek drivers will insist you're safe with them and that they'll drive carefully, but this has little to do with reality. What locals normally pay to them is Rp 5,000 for a short ride and Rp 7,000 to 10,000 for a longer (roughly more than kilometer or 15 minutes walk) one. Foreigners are likely to be asked for more, but generally ojek drivers will accept the proper fare if you insist on it, unless they see you really need to use their service, such as if you're in a hurry but there's a huge traffic jam so using a taxi or bus will be too slow.
In November 2011, Ojek with argometer is called Taxijek has launched in Jakarta and is provided with company's driver identity card, a helmet for passengers, disposable shower caps to wear underneath and an extra raincoat. The fee is cheaper than the non-argometer ojeks make drivers of non-argometer ojeks jealous, moreover the Taxijek can enter the gate of elite housing complexes to pick up passengers due to Taxijek have special driver identity cards. The first flag start at Rp 4,000 ($0.44) and Rp 1,000 ($0.11) for another each kilometer. Call (021)94440739 or visit www.taxijek.com for more information.

As a rule, walking around the centre of Jakarta is neither fun nor practical, especially for the disabled traveler you may find the city a true challange due to poor maintenace of pavement and missing sidewalk.  With the exception of a few posher areas, sidewalks are crowded with pushcart vendors, drivers disregard pedestrians and crossing streets can be dangerous.  On many busy streets there are no pedestrian crossings, so it's best to latch onto a local and follow them as they weave their way through the endless flow of cars, you may found yourself waiting for hours if you decided to wait for one of them to stop for you on pedestrian crossing. If you use pedestrian bridges, watch out for wonky steps and holes, and also look out for motorcycles and bicycles that often use the bridge illegally. Despite this horrible habits of the inhabitants, the downtown area itself does have adequate sidewalks, you may find yourself faster taking the path on foot than travelling by vehicles, there are few recommended guide for you to explore the city:
1) Kota Tua - pedestrian friendly square, you can walk in these area and explore the sight of dutch colonial charm that were once centre of the colonial seat.
2) Pasar Minggu - a pedestrian friendly zone market, that exist since the colonial era
3) Sudirman-Thamrin corridor - the downtown itself have nicely done paved pedestrian footpath for eager explorer all the way through rasuna said, there's available wifi too!
4) Monas and Kebon Sirih area - the city square is pedestrian friendly zone, and the surrounding area have several attraction such as  president palace to old colonial churches
5) Car Free Day - the city centre enclosed itself from motor vehicle, every Sunday from 6.00 a.m. to about 11.00 a.m. This is the moment you can find yourself walking on the road of the city from Sudirman, Thamrin to Monas area, the busway service would still be running in the enclosed zone for travellers to reach their destination.

Casual work in Jakarta is difficult to come by and Indonesian bureaucracy does not readily facilitate foreigners undertaking employment in Indonesia.  As in the rest of Asia, <a href="/en/Teaching_English" title="Teaching English">teaching English</a> is the best option, although salaries are poor (US$700-3000/month is typical, although accommodation may be provided) and the government only allows citizens of the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the USA to work as teachers. Formal work visas, residency permits and registration with several government offices is necessary. Formal approval from the Department of Manpower and and the provision of documentation and guarantees from an employing sponsor is required to engage in any form of employment in Jakarta or elsewhere in Indonesia. Business visas are available for the purposes of conducting business related activities in Jakarta or elsewhere in Indonesia, this class of visa has strict conditions and requires a local business to sponsor the applicant. A business visa does not permit the holder to undertake any form of employment.
<b>Roadside retail</b><br />
Looking for an aluminum hubcap, a large clay pot, some reupholstered car seats or perhaps a full-length mirror with elaborate ironwork?  Not to worry, in Jakarta there's an alley out there just for you, with specialist vendors laying out their goods on streetside racks to entice people driving by.  And given Jakarta's traffic jams, there's often plenty of time to browse too.
If you're stopping in Jakarta, consider buying an extra suitcase, because there's lots of good shopping to be done. You can buy good used suitcases at Jalan Surabaya (see below) and you can see or but another good used things such as old gramophone plates or other 'antiques'.
Note that, for imported goods, prices in many of the more expensive stores can be much higher than what would be charged in the same shops in other countries. Jakarta have malls that vary from the upmarket malls to cheap malls. Global luxurious brands like Chanel, Gucci, Dolce and Gabanna can easily be found in the upscale malls such as <b>Plaza Indonesia</b> or <b>Plaza Senayan</b>. <b>Pacific place</b> mall in Jakarta houses Asia's only Gallerie Lafayette department store. It is not hard for one to find international brands in the city as it exist nearly in all of its major shopping malls. There are also less attractive malls in Jakarta that sells various local cheap brands, electronic product and mobile phone services, usually attached with a supermarket.
As general the city lacks a vibrant shopping street, the city plans <b>Jalan Dr Proffesor Satrio</b> (or simply <b>Satrio Road</b>) that are said to be planned as Jakarta's Orchard road, in the Mega Kuningan area that houses many towering famous hotels such as the rafles. However currently nothing drastic has been done with the exception of a new large mall opening up in the area, though it houses several shopping centers as well.
Jakarta has a vast range of food available at hundreds of eating complexes located all over the huge city.  In addition to selections from all over the country, you can also find excellent Chinese, Japanese, and many other international foods thanks to the cosmopolitan population. Longer-term visitors will wish to dig up a copy of "Jakarta Good Food Guide" (JGFG) or "Jakarta Java Kini". The JGFG, as its affectionately known to Jakartans, is now in its 3rd edition, with the latest version published in 2009 and covering over 600 restaurants and casual eateries in the city. The JGFG has now also been made into an iPod <i>touch</i> &amp; iPhone application, so you can download all 600 reviews and have them in the palm of your hand for whenever you're craving a bite of some good local food.
You can find Jakartan versions of many dishes, often tagged with the label <i>betawi</i> (Indonesian for "Batavian").
Your stomach may need an adjustment period to the local food due to many spices locals used in their cooking. Standard price on this guide: The price for one main course, white rice ("nasi putih") and one soft drink, including 21% tax and service charge.

The food courts of Jakarta's <b>shopping malls</b> are a great way of sampling Indonesian and other food in more hygienic and air-conditioned comfort.
<b>Mal Kelapa Gading</b>
<b>South Jakarta</b>
Most budget restaurants have delivery service or you can call <b>Pesan Delivery</b> service <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.pesandelivery.com">[9]</a>, â +62 21  7278 7070.  You can order take away foods from most budget restaurants. Some traditional Indonesian cuisine may be too hot and spicy for many foreign tourists. At some restaurants you can ask for food without chilli: "Tidak pakai cabe" or "Tidak Pedas". Standard price is Rp 15,000-50,000.
Mid to Upper-scale restaurants are plentiful and prices range from Rp 30,000-100,000 for entrees.
The best gourmet splurges in Jakarta are the <b>opulent buffet spreads</b> in the 5 star hotels such as the Marriott, Hotel Mulia, Ritz-Carlton and Shangri-La, which offer amazing value by international standards. Standard price: Rp 150,000-300,000 per person
Jakarta may be the capital of the world's largest country with Islamic population, but it has underground life of its own and alcohol drinking is not prohibited. If you're the clubbing type, its nightlife is arguably among the best in Asia.  From the upscale X-Lounge to the seediest discos like Stadium, Jakarta caters to all kinds of clubbers, but bring a friend if you decide to brave the seedier joints (though they tend to have the best DJs).  Fans of live music, on the other hand, are largely out of luck if they go to budget bars, at least unless they're into Indonesian pop.
When out and about, note that Jakarta has a fairly high number of <b>prostitutes</b>, known in local parlance as <i>ayam</i> (lit. "chicken"), so much so that much of the female clientele of some respectable bars (operated by five-star hotels, etc) is on the take.
A nightlife district popular among expats is <b>Blok M</b> in <a href="/en/Jakarta/South" title="Jakarta/South">South Jakarta</a>, or more specifically the single lane of Jl. Palatehan 1 just north of the bus terminal, packed with pubs and bars geared squarely towards single male Western visitors.  While lacking the bikini-clad go-go dancers of <a href="/en/Bangkok/Silom" title="Bangkok/Silom">Patpong</a>, the meat market atmosphere is much the same with poor country girls turned pro.  D's and My Bar are two of the most popular spots, while Sportsman is a more quiet and respectable spot. Blok M is now easily accessible as the southern terminus of BRT Line 1.  For a more off-the-beaten track experience, head a few blocks south to Jl. Melawai 6 (<i>opposite Plaza Blok M</i>), Jakarta's de-facto <b>Little Japan</b> with lots of Japanese restaurants, bars, karaoke joints and ayam girls.
<b>Jalan Jaksa</b> is also popular among expats and backpackers. Jalan Jaksa has the cheapest (or equal cheapest) beer in Jakarta. Generally a little cheaper in other respects as well, Jalan Jaksa is also a bit more laid back. Papa's Cafe is a popular spot, and the Beatles can be heard most nights at Memories Cafe. However there is a variety of other entertainment in a friendly, casual athmosphere. Jalan Jaksa also has cheap food and cheap to moderately priced accommodation.
To hang out where Indonesia's young, rich and beautiful do, head to Plaza Indonesia's <b>EX</b> annex, packed full of trendy clubs and bars including Jakarta's Hard Rock Cafe.  Plaza Senayan's <b>Arcadia</b> annex attempts to duplicate the concept, but with more of an emphasis on fine dining.  The Kemang area in <a href="/en/Jakarta/South" title="Jakarta/South">southern Jakarta</a> is popular with expats and locals alike. It has numerous places to eat, drink and dance as well houses several boutiques and shops.
The Kota area in <a href="/en/Jakarta/North" title="Jakarta/North">northern Jakarta</a> is the oldest part of town with numerous colonial buildings still dominating the area. It is also considered to be the seediest part of town after midnight. Most karaoke bars and 'health' clubs there are in fact brothels who mostly cater to local Jakartans. Even regular discos such as Stadium and Crown have special areas designated for prostitutes.  Other notable establishments in this area are Malioboro and Club 36 which should not be missed. This part of town has a large ethnic Chinese population who also dominate the clubbing scene there.
The bulk of the clubbing scene is spread throughout Jakarta however, most usually found in office buildings or hotels. A help of an experienced local with finding these places is recommended. Do note that nightlife in Jakarta tends to be pricey for local standards.
In general, dress codes are strictly enforced in Jakarta: no shorts, no slippers.  Drunken, rowdy behavior is frowned upon. During the month of Ramadan, all nightlife ends at midnight and many operations close for the entire month.
<i>Please see the individual Jakarta <a href="/en/Jakarta#Districts" title="Jakarta">district</a> articles for accommodation listings</i>
The travel agencies at Jakarta's airport can have surprisingly good rates for mid-range and above hotels. Star ratings are reserved for midrange and better hotels, while budget places have "Melati" rankings from 1-3 (best).  Tax and service charge of 21% are usually added to the bill.
<b>Budget</b>:  Backpacker hostels (<i>losmen</i>) can be found in <b>Jalan Jaksa</b>, which is close to Gambir Station (to the east) and Sarina (to the west) with the Trans-Jakarta busway. Rooms start from Rp 50,000/night. Clean, air-conditioned rooms with own bathroom start at about Rp 100,000/night. Hotels with standard room rate start at about US$22/night.
<b>Mid-range</b>,  Hotels with standard room rate of from US$26-100/night.
<b>Splurge</b>,  Jakarta has more than its fair share of luxury hotels, and after the prolonged post-crash hangover new ones are now going up again.  Many remain good value by world prices, but opulent lobbies do not always correspond to the same quality in the room. The standard room rate on splurge hotels are more than US$100/night. Accor Group hotels (Mercure, Grand Mercure, Ibis, Novotel, Pullman), Intercontinental, Le Meridien, Shangri-La, Kempinski are just to name a few existing foreign chains, as well as local brands such as Mulia and The Sultan Hotel &amp; Residence whose hotels are situated in Senayan, and Santika hotels.
For stay of a month or more, monthly rental rooms (called <i>kost</i>) and apartments are a good alternative to budget and mid-range hotels, respectively. Fully-furnished rooms (with TV, A/C, large bed, hot shower, kitchen outside) can be rented for Rp 1.5-4 million/month. In most cases, rental fee already includes electricity and water usage, often there are additional services included like laundry, Internet access, breakfast, etc. There are cheaper rooms as well (starting from Rp 500,000-700,000), but those are usually small, without window, and the furniture includes just bed or even nothing. Also, some cheaper places are exclusively for either men or women (no opposite sex tenants or visitors allowed); many others allow couples to stay together - but only if they're legally married. Check on this before committing to rent.
For apartments (one or more rooms + private kitchen + often balcony), prices are from Rp 3-4 million and up. Cheaper rates can be obtained in some places which are oriented to the long-term rental (6 months or 1 year minimum); however, there may be same limitations as for cheaper rooms. Once again, check before committing.

If you see a <b>public telephone</b>, lift the receiver and check the number in the display near the keypad.  If the number is not 000, don't insert coins, because the phone is broken.  They usually are broken, but are very cheap (just $0.01/min) when they do work. Keep in mind that the public telephone can't make calls to cellular GSM phone.
Better to <b>buy a SIM card</b> for your cellphone/mobile/handphone. For $2 or less you can get a local SIM and some credit.
If you have your own laptop you may be able to access networks at many of the capital's malls.  Ask at the information desk for access codes. Free hotspots are also available on most McDonald restaurants and StarBucks Cafes. Several hotels also provide a free wifi hotspot in their lobby. There are also free available Wifi at Thamrin-Sudirman road corridor in the centre of the city.
Internet cafes are available in many parts of the city with a price of Rp 4,000-5,000. However, most of them only have dial-up capabilities. Most of the internet cafes can be found around universities, residential areas, and in most shopping malls. However, the internet connection speed can be better in the internet cafes found at malls.
If you are keen on using the internet for long hours, try to get the "happy hour" deals provided by internet cafes near universities or residential areas. They provide 6 hr of surfing on the internet for Rp 12,000, but only available at midnight-6AM.

There are three sources of tap water in Jakarta: 1) from drinking-water company, 2) from deep artesian wells, and 3) from shallow wells. Water from source #1 and #2, originally are drinkable when it leaves the source, but some pipes maybe ill-maintained. And there is no way for you to know if the source of your water is not from source #3 or not (unless if you ask). Hence, to be on the safe side, <i>always</i> drink bottled water, or boil your water before drinking it. Never drink tap water directly. In Depok and Bogor boiled tap water is considered drinkable, but in most areas of Jakarta, make your tea and coffee from bottled water.
If buying bottled water from a street vendor always check the 'tamper proof' seal is intact.
In the coastal areas of Jakarta, such as North Jakarta, the water quality is even worse and if you have a 'bak mandi' in your bathroom using the water from shallow well, adding one capfull of Detol to the 100 to 200 litres of water may be a good idea. To the south eg, South Jakarta, Depok and Bogor, the water quality is better - but still don't drink it un-boiled.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Jakarta is the 3rd most polluted city in the world after <a href="/en/Mexico_City" title="Mexico City">Mexico City</a> and <a href="/en/Bangkok" title="Bangkok">Bangkok</a>.
During the rainy season (December, January, and February), lower parts of Jakarta (mostly those to the north) are often flooded, turning the lower parts of Jakarta into 'Little Venice' or 'Jakarta's Venice' because of the roads changing into canals that resemble Venice, Italy. Thanks to the completion of East-Flood-Canal, much of the water is channeled directly to the sea without a chance of passing through the central part of the city.
There is a law against smoking at public places in Jakarta, and the smoker can (in theory) be fined up to US$5,000. You may see the signs threatening a fine (<i>denda</i>) of Rp 50 million or 6 months jail for smoking, although that law seems not to be enforced (due to the extreme level of tolerance of most Jakartans). You can see that some locals still smoke on the street and even in local buses, as anywhere in Indonesia, but when reminded they usually stop smoking. It's generally prohibited to smoke, however, inside shops, offices, and air-conditioned buildings generally. If in doubt, take the safer side: Don't smoke.
Learn from Jakartans about how to stay comfortable in the heat and humidity of the city: Wear only cotton clothing to absorb the extra sweat + humidity of the air. And wear it long so that it function as comfortable SPF-200 sun protection at the same time. Street workers in Jakarta usually wear wide straw hat or bamboo hats to protect their head and face from the sun, and they always have a super mini towel ready within reach to wipe the sweat.
<br />
The high-profile <b>terrorist bomb blasts</b> at the JW Marriott in 2003, the Australian Embassy in 2004 and the JW Marriott (again) and the Ritz-Carlton in 2009 mean that security in Jakarta tends to be heavy, with car trunk checks, metal detectors and bag searches at most major buildings. Statistically, though, you are far more likely to be killed in the traffic. The city is relatively safe for travelers to roam around and explore the city, but it doesn't mean that one must not be aware of what might comes to them.
Criminal problem become more serious in the last 10 years. Although most of the criminal case are pickpocket and bag snatching which are usually done by act and run. However, there are increasing number of more serious criminality such as mugging by group with intimidation using the weapon, even using assembled gun sometimes and they become more ruthless with the victim lately and sometimes they are not hesitate to hurt or kill if they think it cause a resistance from the victim. Another unsafe area are usually on the traffic light in some certain area during the night time, usually there are some street beggar, unemployement and even holdlum. Organised criminals player sometimes operate on the streets (especially at traffic lights) without fearing crowds.
Be on your guard in crowded places such as markets, because pickpockets often steal wallets and cell phones. Keep a close eye on your valuables and choose your transportation options carefully, especially at night. Business travellers need to keep a close eye on laptops, which have been known to disappear even from within office buildings. For all-night party excursions, it may be wise to keep your cab waiting; the extra cost is cheap and it's worth it for the security. Lock your car doors and windows, and show no cell phones or wallets on the dashboard. 
If the theft is done by stealth, often simple catching the thief in the act will cause him to run away. Indonesians rarely ignore for any case of crime with foreigner. please ask for help ("Tolong!").
For intimidation such as robberies, simply giving them an object of value will usually satisfy the thief, who will leave without further ado.
There is also a lot of scam such as playing act as a staff or salesperson providing an interesting promo package or lottery which is usually a complicated trick with the ending of riding over you (sometimes by hipnotise) to an ATM. The con artist is then free to withdraw the money from your account. 
Other mode are They approach you in the terminal or in the public place and offering you a ride or leading you to a ride usually to the unofficial van or car with the fake license plate number. They also put some fake woman passanger to convince you as a safe riding but actually There would be ended with a kidnapping or simply mugging you inside after they run to the far place and they will throw you away thereafter.   
Another popular trick are they pretending as a someone recognize you, usually become a friendly person and try to make a simple chat or talk with the intention to distract your awareness then simply providing a snack or beverages contain a substance to make you groogy and unconciousness. You often become an easy target of such crime if you looks a newcomers or looking naive so be careful.
There are also many case of school, motor gank and neigbourhood fighting which are not uncommon involving everybody surrounding who are pass in between the scene.
The tips to avoid those case are always exert general precaution with the surrounding area, knowing the place that you are there or your destination, avoid walking alone in the dark, devoid, slum area, avoid bring any eye catching valuable things, dress moderately, go anywhere with people only if you know them, never trusting the unknown people, make sure asking information to the right person especially if you are tourist, and report any crime on you to the nearest police station although it is rarely solving the problem. If you carry a large amount of money (including passports etc), keep this more safely secured. Then carry a smaller amount, say $20 to $40, in a wallet or purse for minor purchases. If this is taken, it will be no great loss. Also avoid large group concentration
Most Indonesians are very protective of their neighbors. In many neighborhoods, a thief caught by the local residents will be punished "traditionally" before being taken to police.
