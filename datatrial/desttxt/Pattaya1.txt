<b>Pattaya</b> (à¸à¸±à¸à¸¢à¸²) is a seaside resort on the <a href="/en/Eastern_Gulf_Coast" title="Eastern Gulf Coast">Eastern Gulf Coast</a> of <a href="/en/Thailand" title="Thailand">Thailand</a>, about 150 km southeast of <a href="/en/Bangkok" title="Bangkok">Bangkok</a>. Pattaya is mostly famous for its go-go and beer bars, but local authorities have made some efforts to provide more family-friendly attractions and activities. Although the sex industry is still going strong and sex tourism remains the key money earner for Pattaya, the resort also attracts local families and holidaymakers from around the world. If you are going to be offended by the sight of fat old men hand in hand with young Thai women, then Pattaya is probably not the place for you.
Efforts by local authorities over the past few years have improved the quality of the beaches, but they are still lacklustre by Thailand's standards, and over-development has long since destroyed some of the natural charms the area once had. However, the plethora of hotels and guest houses, and easy access from the capital and airport, make it a popular weekend getaway. Catering for over five million annual visitors, Pattaya is also able to offer an excellent range of eating options and a wide variety of things to do. Its population is a colourful mix of nationalities and ethnicities from near and far.
Pattaya occupies most of the coastline of Bang Lamung District (one of the eleven districts that comprise Chonburi Province). This article only deals with Pattaya proper, which spans the areas to the east of Naklua Beach and Pattaya Beach, plus the Buddha Hill headland (which is immediately south of Pattaya Beach). <a href="/en/Jomtien" title="Jomtien">Jomtien</a> is covered in a separate article, and contains Jomtien Beach and the areas east of it, including Dongtan Beach. The beaches of Jomtien are much broader and generally in a better shape, and the atmosphere locally is more sedate and family-oriented than at Pattaya Beach.
Pattaya's downtown area is easy to get around. Running north-south, a few hundred metres apart, are <b>Beach Road</b> (Thanon Hat Pattaya, sometimes also referred to as First Road) which borders the main beach (Hat Pattaya), <b>Pattaya Second Road</b> and <b>Pattaya Third Road</b> (with the smaller but busy <b>Soi Buakhao</b> in between), and the main <b>Sukhumvit Road</b> coastal highway. Beach Road is one-way (southbound), likewise Second Road (northbound).
These are connected by the three major east-west aligned roads: <b>North Pattaya Road</b> (Thanon Pattaya Nua), <b>Central Pattaya Road</b> (Thanon Pattaya Klang) and <b>South Pattaya Road</b> (Thanon Pattaya Tai). North Pattaya Road is a dual carriageway and carries the highest volume of traffic to and from Sukhumvit Road.
Also connecting Beach Road and Second Road are a large number of smaller streets or "sois". The main sois are numbered from 1 to 16, from north to south. Sois 1-6 are between North Pattaya Road and Central Pattaya Road; sois 7-13 are between Central Pattaya Road and South Pattaya Road (including the "Pattayaland" sois, immediately north of South Pattaya Road); sois 14-16 are south of South Pattaya Road. Most of these east-west sois are (in theory at least) one-way.
Beach Road, Second Road, and North Pattaya Road (plus Naklua Road to the north) all meet at the <b>Dolphin Roundabout</b> landmark. Heavy traffic and frequent accidents here have resulted in a semi-permanent diversion being set up which, at peak times, prevents vehicles (except motorcycles) from continuing around this roundabout any further than the North Pattaya Road exit, pending the installation of traffic lights some time in 2006.
Second Road south of South Pattaya Road becomes Pratamnak Road, which shares a junction with both the southern end of Third Road and the northern end of the main road to Jomtien, Tappraya Road.
Beach Road south of South Pattaya Road is closed to vehicles in the evenings (currently 18:00-02:00) and is called <b>Walking Street</b>; it's the main tourist area, both for nightlife and shopping. Other major tourism areas include the section of Second Road between sois 1-4, and the sois immediately north of South Pattaya Road.
At the southern end of Walking Street is the New Pier, usually called <b>Bali Hai Pier</b> (sometimes "Pattaya Pier" or "South Pier"). The Old Pier, close to the junction of Beach Road and South Pattaya Road, is still shown on most maps but was dismantled and removed at the beginning of 2006.
<b>South is central, Central is north</b><br />
Pattaya's sub-district names sometimes cause confusion, usually when the official Pattaya Bay area titles (North Pattaya, Central Pattaya, South Pattaya) are misunderstood. These names don't relate to Pattaya as a whole, instead they refer to the sections of Pattaya Beach to which each sub-district is aligned.
Pattaya's coastal side is divided longitudinally into five contiguous sub-districts (or six, if also including Jomtien). Each one is named after the section of beach or headland at its seaboard.
In the middle are the three Pattaya Bay sub-districts, which share the main <i>Baht Bus</i> route (so most places are within 5 minutes / 10 baht of most other places, at any hour) and have much else in common, and hence in combination make up the main quasi-downtown zone:
Flanking the Pattaya Beach sub-districts are:
In practice, exactly where each sub-district ends and the next begins is a very grey area as none of the boundaries lie along major roads (and none of the many readily available tourist maps attempts to define boundaries at this level); nevertheless they do provide a handy rough guide to approximate latitude. Further inland, the sub-district names are used less, and locality/road names take precedence - for example, an address might state "Sukhumvit, Naklua" which is useful in that it makes it clear the location is to the north of the Sukhumvit / North Pattaya Road intersection, however the exact same place would not normally be described simply as being "in Naklua" as that would give the misleading impression of it being in the main beachside/tourism area further west.
Pattaya's name was originally "Thap Phraya", meaning Army of the Phraya - commemorating the surrender of Nai Klom's army to that of Phraya Tak (later King Taksin the Great), without a fight. Thap Phraya became Phatthaya (the name of the north-easterly wind at the beginning of the rainy season), and then Phatthaya (the true phonetic spelling).
The Vietnam War and its warriors made Pattaya a well-known recreational centre, especially among American GIâs. From its beginning in 1959 with a small private bungalow where American officers on leave took turna to for "R and R" (rest and recreation), this sleepy village by the sea has grown and changed dramatically into one of the worldâs tourism hot spots.  The opening of the new <a href="#Suvarnabhumi">Suvarnabhumi Airport</a> (located to the east of Bangkok, alongside the expressway to Pattaya) has made visiting easier than ever.
Pattaya is popular not only as a beach resort and for its entertainment, nightlife and shopping, but also for the broad selection of pastimes it caters for, from golf and horseback riding to bungee jumping, karting and shootingânot to mention a wide variety of watersports such as <a href="/en/Scuba_diving" title="Scuba diving">scuba diving</a>, jet-skiing, sailing, water skiing, windsurfing and kitesurfing, and a whole lot more. Pattaya is also very popular as a conference, convention, and seminar venue, and the grapevine hosts rumours of future developments of varying degrees of plausibility, such as a horse racing track, casinos, and a tram system.
The Tourist Authority of Thailand (TAT) <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.tourismthailand.org/destinationguide/list.aspx?provinceid=11">[1]</a> Information Office is just outside the centre, exactly 1 km south of the junction of Second Road and South Pattaya Road.

Pattaya is located 147 km from Bangkok and can be reached in a comfortable 2-hour drive. There are two convenient ways to get there.
Most visitors arrive by road from or via <a href="/en/Bangkok" title="Bangkok">Bangkok</a>, many having flown in to Suvarnabhumi (the "new" BKK). Much smaller numbers arrive direct by road from the north and east, by rail from Bangkok, and by air via U-Tapao from <a href="/en/Ko_Samui" title="Ko Samui">Ko Samui</a> or <a href="/en/Phuket" title="Phuket">Phuket</a> in <a href="/en/South_(Thailand)" title="South (Thailand)" class="mw-redirect">Southern Thailand</a> or <a href="/en/Siem_Reap" title="Siem Reap">Siem Reap</a> in <a href="/en/Cambodia" title="Cambodia">Cambodia</a>.
U-Tapao-Rayong-Pattaya International Airport <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.utapao.com">[2]</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IATA" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:IATA">IATA</a>: <b>UTP</b> | <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICAO" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:ICAO">ICAO</a>: <b>VTBU</b> | tel: +66 38 245 295), often known somewhat inaccurately as "Pattaya Airport", is at <a href="/en/Sattahip" title="Sattahip">Sattahip</a>, just off the main Sattahip-Chanthaburi (Sukhumvit) highway, 30 km south of Pattaya. Primarily a military facility, it's the closest airport fielding commercial passenger flights, but only to Phuket and Samui domestically. There are no commercial passenger flights connecting U-Tapao directly with Bangkok.
Schedules (all daily, as at January 1st 2006):
<b> Bangkok Airways (PG)</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.bangkokair.com">[3]</a> flies to/from <a href="/en/Ko_Samui" title="Ko Samui">Ko Samui (USM)</a> and <a href="/en/Phuket" title="Phuket">Phuket (HKT)</a> - UTP-USM &amp; USM-UTP flights are usually slightly less expensive than BKK-USM &amp; USM-BKK flights<small>
</small>
<b>When booking flights to U-Tapao...</b><br />
...consider pre-booking onward transport at the same time, as competitively priced door-to-door transfer services may not be available on arrival at U-Tapao on an ad hoc basis.
The easiest way to transfer between U-Tapao and Pattaya is by direct door-to-door minibus. Driving time is normally about 30 minutes (200-250 baht per person for pre-booked services). Metered taxi costs 750 baht including motorway tolls, if purchased at hotel.
If speed and convenience don't matter, the ad hoc option is to hop on virtually any bus on Sukhumvit Road. Going south, if it's a bus that terminates at Sattahip you'll have to swap buses or finish the journey by songthaew; if it's going further east (e.g., Rayong, Chanthaburi, or Trat) it'll drop you off at the airport entrance as it goes by. Going north, wait for a bus that's going further than Sattahip and then you won't need to transfer. Alternatively, the white songthaews that ply Sukhumvit Road between Pattaya and Sattahip charge just 20 baht.
Or to buck the trend big time, go by rail (3rd class, weekdays only) between Pattaya and Sattahip, get off just before or after the line crosses Highway 3, and connect with the airport by songthaew or bus. The fare for the 40-50 minute train ride is 6 (yes, six!) baht - depart Pattaya 10:18, arrive Sattahip 11:00; depart Sattahip 13:30, arrive Pattaya 14:21. But don't forget, no trains on Saturdays or Sundays.
<a href="/en/Bangkok#Suvarnabhumi_Airport" title="Bangkok">Suvarnabhumi Airport</a> (BKK) is 110 km from Pattaya (40 km closer than Don Muang Airport). Transfers by road take around 80-90 minutes in dry weather, 120 minutes in wet weather).
Taxi fares from Suvarnabhumi Airport to Pattaya should be negotiated with the driver in advance. The "standard rate" is 1,500 baht and you should confirm it before leaving the taxi rank.  At quiet hours you may be able to negotiate downward.  Passengers will be expected to pay the two tolls en route, at 30 baht each.
Be aware that non-licensed taxis may try to solicit business from you, and it is important to note that these drivers do not have proper credentials.
One option though to save some money is to take a metered, licensed taxi from the departure level (avoiding the 50 baht airport fee). Given that they are only allowed to drop off passengers and then are supposed to leave right after, you are in a pretty good bargaining position when it comes to talking about prices. Go for a taxi where the driver isn't outside the car, but waiting inside (meaning they didn't bribe the security guards to be allowed to wait longer and need to depart soon).
Time to Pattaya is approximately 1 hour and 45 minutes during non-peak hours, and can take double this during rush hour.
It is also possible to arrange airport pickup through most hotels, and through any number of local taxi agents.  Fares through less expensive local hotels are generally the same 1,500 baht as the "standard" metered taxi rate, with larger resorts and international chain hotels often charging much higher rates.  Local prearranged cars will run between 1,000-1,500 baht.
Return fares from Pattaya to Suvarnabhumi Airport fares are 800 baht plus tolls for a returning metered taxi if arranged in advance. Taxis may or may not be available at the last minute.  A private car service arranged through a (local) hotel or travel agent kiosk will be around 1,200-1,500 baht.
<a href="/en/Bangkok#Don_Muang_Airport" title="Bangkok">Don Muang Airport</a> (DMK) currently handles AirAsia, Nok Air, One-Two-GO, PB Air, and most Thai Airways domestic flights. The easiest way to transfer is by taxi; the most economical alternatives are to go by bus via Mo Chit (Bangkok's Northern Bus Terminal), or to go by train via Hualamphong (only practicable in the Pattaya to Don Muang direction). As of October 2012, Air Asia, both international and domestic, will be based at Terminal 1.
1st class buses from <a href="/en/Bangkok" title="Bangkok">Bangkok</a> to the North Pattaya Rd bus station are air-conditioned, almost always have an on-board toilet, are essentially direct (i.e., no stops), and provide a no fuss, no frills, hassle-free service. Departures from the Eastern (Ekamai) Terminal and Northern (Mo Chit) Terminal are frequent (every 20-40 minutes, depending on the time of day; more frequent still at public holiday weekends) and usually take 2-2.5 hours; those from the Southern (Sai Tai Taling Chan à¸ªà¸²à¸¢à¹à¸à¹à¸à¸¥à¸´à¹à¸à¸à¸±à¸) Bus Terminal are less frequent and take a little longer.
Departure times &amp; fares (as at June 2006):
Fares may vary slightly depending on the route taken. For example, at busy times when the Moh Chit service uses the elevated express tollway, a marginally higher fare applies. Exact prices are always clearly posted at the official ticket counters.
All 1st class direct services to/from Bangkok use the recently redeveloped bus station on North Pattaya Rd. These buses are usually full when they depart, and must be boarded at the terminus. Tickets are sold at the bus station; it's not possible to pre-book these services more than an hour or so in advance. Usually, if the bus that's due to leave next is already full, there will be seats available on the next one. The longest queues are for the very early morning departures from Pattaya. To get a seat on the first bus of the day you need to be in the ticket queue at least 30-40 minutes early. The bonus is that these pre-rush hour services can take as little as 90 minutes to get to Bangkok.
From the North Pattaya Rd bus station <i>songthaews</i> (a cross between a pickup truck, a share-taxi, a local bus and two pews) depart when full (every few minutes). The fare to anywhere on Beach Rd ("the beach") is 25 baht; press the buzzer button on the underside of the roof when you want to get off.
Be wary of touts who solicit you at various bus stations in Bangkok.  Most of them provide private minivan transport and won't drop you off at the main Pattaya station on North Pattaya Road.  You will likely find yourself miles outside Pattaya.  They also don't begin their journeys until the minivan is full.  Unless you want to charter your own van, you should stick to the government buses or those offered by Roong Reuang Coach.  These mainstream providers operate out of clearly marked counters and offices and do not send touts to solicit business.
<b>Pattaya to the Eastern (Ekamai) Terminal</b>: if requested, this bus will stop at the On Nut Skytrain Station (<i>station map</i> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.bts.co.th/en/images/Station%20Map/E9.gif">[4]</a>) on Sukhumvit Rd. Depending on your final destination and the traffic conditions, you may want to transfer to the <a href="/en/Bangkok#Skytrain" title="Bangkok">Skytrain</a> (<i>system map</i> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.bts.co.th/en/map.asp">[5]</a>) there; if so, wait until the bus departs Pattaya and then confirm with the crew that you want to be dropped off at "On Nut". NB: this bus does <i><b>not</b></i> stop to pick up passengers at On Nut (or anywhere else) on the outbound leg. Also on request the bus will stop along the Bangna-Trat Expressway opposite the Central Department Store Bangna.
<b>Pattaya from/to the Southern (Sai Tai Mai) Terminal</b>: if the direct bus is fully booked, take the Eastern (Ekamai) Terminal bus instead, and use the #511 (air-con, every 30 minutes 24/7, 20 baht) bus to connect between Ekamai and Sai Tai Mai.

<b>Pattaya/Jomtien Beach from/to Suvarnabhumi Airport: Governmental bus</b><a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://airportpattayabus.com/">[7]</a> Tel. +66 86-324-2391. 134 baht (as of September 2012) to Pattaya: 07:00, 09:00, 11:00, 13:00, 15:00, 17:00, 19:00, 21:00 and 22:00. Even more frequency if passenger numbers dictate. The bus departs directly from the airport at Level 1 between door 7-8 and makes stops along Sukhumvit Rd at Pattaya Nua (north), Pattaya Klang (middle), Pattaya Tai (south), its bus station at Thapphraya Rd (corner lower end of Theprasit Rd), and the bus station at Chaiyapreuk Rd.
Departing from the Jomtien bus station <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://airportpattayabus.com/2012/pattaya.html">[8]</a> (Tel. +66 86-324-2389) at Thapphraya Rd/corner of Theprasit Rd to the airport at 07:00, 08:00, 10:00, 12:00, 14:00, 16:00, 18:00, 20:00, and 21:00. It is possible to board the bus 20 minutes prior to its departing time at the bus station at Chaiyapreuk Rd. No other stops are made.
2nd class services (air-con, usually no on-board toilet) don't use the expressways, and make frequent (and sometimes lengthy) stops, hence they take considerably longer than their 1st class counterparts (which at worst will only halt momentarily once or twice to let passengers jump off on the final approaches to their destination). As at June 2006 the 2nd class fare is 100 baht, so the difference in price doesn't amount to much.
Many 2nd class buses from Bangkok continue on to <b><a href="/en/Pattaya/Jomtien" title="Pattaya/Jomtien" class="mw-redirect">Jomtien</a></b>, so may be worth considering if that's your final destination and you're not in a hurry. For travel from Jomtien to Bangkok they have the advantage that they can be flagged down and boarded as they crawl along Jomtien's seafront road, Jomtien Beach Rd (Thanon Hat Jomtien), avoiding the need for a preliminary trip to the bus station.
The terminus for 2nd class services to/from Bangkok and other short-haul destinations is on South Pattaya Rd, but in practice these buses pick up and drop off the majority of their passengers en route. Tickets are sold both at the bus station (although advance booking may not be possible) and on the bus itself.
The airport bus service, not very well advertised, from Suvarnabhumi Airport, is brand new, as are the buses. Direct from the airport, and terminating at Jomtien Beach Rd &amp; Soi Chiaproek, it costs 112 baht. Currently 5 return trips either way per day. You won't get too much info on this service, as it is not a private company, it is run by government employees, and you will be directed to the taxis and mini-buses, by the touts at the airport. Upon arrival at Jomtien, (1 hour or so) there are many guest houses,and hotels, prices vary from 550 baht,(Maggie Mays) to 3,500 baht (Nusa Playa). From cheap and cheerful to luxurious.
It's also possible to travel by minibus to <a href="/en/Hat_Lek" title="Hat Lek">Hat Lek</a> (for the southern-most border crossing between <a href="/en/Thailand" title="Thailand">Thailand</a> and <a href="/en/Cambodia" title="Cambodia">Cambodia</a>), but not every day of the week. This service may or may not go via <a href="/en/Laem_Ngop" title="Laem Ngop">Laem Ngop</a> depending on overall demand. As of January 2006: depart 07:30, arrive around 14:00, 700 baht, Tuesday and Friday only, but subject to change, so inquire locally for the latest schedule details.
Travel agencies (ubiquitous throughout Pattaya) plus many hotels/guesthouses sell minibus tickets, and tourist-oriented services such as these invariably include collection from your hotel/guesthouse/wherever (allow extra time for this. Times quoted above are approximate transit times and make no allowance for the vagaries of the collection process).
Public taxis serving the airport must have a meter, be air-conditioned, and be less than five years old.  The driver should have an Airports of Thailand certificate.
<b>To Bangkok</b> - widely advertised in Pattaya at 800 baht (the lower price is because it'll be a Bangkok cab returning home), and easily arranged through most travel agencies and hotels/guesthouses. The driver pays 300 baht commission to the agency, if you can hail one yourself you might be able to negotiate lower. Minibuses can also be chartered taxi-style from around 1800 baht.
<b>From Bangkok</b> - prices range from 1500 baht (the official meter-taxi rate) to 1000 baht; arranged car services will tend toward the higher end, but licenced meter-taxis should be negotiable to the lower end of the range. Allow about 90-120 minutes, depending on where in Bangkok you're coming from; more around rush hour.
<b>From Suvarnabhumi Airport</b> - the official meter-taxi price to Pattaya is 1050 baht (1100 baht to Jomtien) plus the 60 baht highway ("motorway" or "expressway") toll (this isn't necessary outside peak times, when travelling down below is just as fast). Allow around 80-90 minutes in favourable conditions.
<b>Scams</b> to watch out for when headed for Bangkok by taxi include being told that the pre-paid price is fully inclusive, but then, on arrival at the first toll booth, being told that the expressway fees are extra.
Many of the more upmarket hotels can arrange (for an additional fee) to have you met at the airport gate by a personal driver with a limousine, thus avoiding the need to negotiate with taxi drivers, or you can book a limousine in advance online <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.limousine.in.th/">[9]</a>
Provided it's a weekday, the most economical way to travel between Pattaya and Bangkok by public transport is by rail. The one-way fare is just 31 baht, and if you've never experienced a 3rd class Thai train, this can be an interesting experience.
From Monday to Friday, a single daily 3rd class <b>(no aircon)</b> train departs <a href="/en/Bangkok#Hualamphong_Train_Station" title="Bangkok">Bangkok's Hualamphong Train Station</a> at 06:50 and arrives at the main Pattaya station at 10:18, before continuing on to Sattahip; it then returns via Pattaya at 14:21 and terminates back in Bangkok at 18:25 (on Saturdays and Sundays it turns back to Bangkok at <a href="/en/Chachoengsao" title="Chachoengsao">Chachoengsao</a>, so is of no practical use for getting to or from Pattaya on weekends). Regardless of direction, simply turn up and buy a ticket at the station. This train can't be pre-booked.
Pattaya has two train stations, both just east of Sukhumvit Road:
At the main Pattaya Train Station, tickets must be bought before boarding and are only sold in the final 30 minutes prior to departure. The fare from/to Bangkok is 31 baht, from/to Sattahip, 6 baht. One train to Bangkok a day, but not on weekends.
As the Pattaya Tai station has no ticket office, passengers are permitted to board here without tickets and then pay on the train (32 baht to Bangkok).
The surcharge for transporting a bicycle (up to 20 kg) between any two points on this line (e.g., Bangkok-Sattahip) is 80 baht.
Tickets for other journeys can be purchased (up to a maximum of 60 days in advance) at the Pattaya Train Station ticket office between 08:00 and 16:00. The same tickets can also be arranged through Pattaya agencies, who will add on a 200-300 baht mark-up to cover their assistance and the cost of sending a motorbike taxi to collect the tickets from the station.
Although travelling by train is most economical, is quite slow. However, it makes sense if you continue by train from Bangkok as you avoid switching from the metro and/or taxi, arriving directly at the train station. It takes as much as 3.5 hours, but the bus takes between 1.5 and 2.5 hours and you have to add one hour to get to the station.
The city-produced "Official Map of Pattaya" is available at Pattaya City Hall, and may also be available from the Pattaya Police, the Tourist Police and the Immigration Police.
Songthaews are also known as public passenger pick-up vehicles.
Apart from a handful of privately operated examples, Pattaya has no <a href="/en/Thailand#Tuk-tuk" title="Thailand">tuk-tuks</a> and most ad hoc local transport is undertaken by a flotilla of over 700 dark blue coloured <a href="/en/Thailand#Songthaew" title="Thailand">songthaews</a>, pickup trucks converted to buses, also called <b>Baht Buses</b>. The fare is 10 baht for trips within (and between) Pattaya and Jomtien, for locals and foreigners. Having the correct change is by no means essential, but does keep the potential hassle factor to a minimum. In the past, dual pricing applied (technically 5 baht base fare, but generally only applied to locals, with a 10 baht fare for foreigners) and some drivers will shortchange you on a 20 baht note if you don't act like you know what you're doing, but most will return 10 baht. Avoid asking destination when using songthaew, as many drivers will charge 100-200 baht. If you know the direction, it's recommended to just ride the songthaew without asking for a destination. That way you will just pay 10 baht per person no matter how far you go.
Flat fares only apply when operating as a bus. Beware the driver of an otherwise empty songthaew, especially one that's parked at the roadside, who might presume that you want to charter a taxi, in which case expect a much higher fare of 100 baht or more, depending on your negotiating skills. Taxis in Pattaya do not use the metres at all, and unless you can speak Thai, start at 150 baht and up.
The busiest route is the beach circuit: from the junction of Second Rd and South Pattaya Rd, north along Second Rd to the Dolphin Circle roundabout; then south along the full length of Beach Rd; then briefly east along South Pattaya Rd to complete the loop. Frequency is virtually non-stop, and even at the most unlikely hours, average waiting time is literally no more than a minute, often only a few seconds during daytime hours.
The routes sometimes vary. For example, with a left turn (from Beach Rd or Second Rd) into Central Pattaya Rd; or no left turn at the Dolphin Circle roundabout (where Second Rd, Beach Rd and North Pattaya Rd meet) and going straight on to Naklua (or even a right turn towards the bus station and Sukhumvit). The only way to know the route for sure is to ask (but don't let the driver mistake your asking as a charter request). Sometimes the driver will just decide to turn down a random soi for no apparent reason, or because he's just been hired as a taxi, but you'll still be expected to pay your 10 baht if you've ridden for more than a soi or two - however surprises such as these are few and far between.
It's also easy to catch songthaews along South Pattaya Rd, Central Pattaya Rd, and North Pattaya Rd; in the case of the latter, there's often a songthaew waiting at the Dolphin Circle roundabout (they depart from here at regular intervals, or when full, and the fare to the bus station is 10 baht) and there's also a free songthaew service to the Tesco-Lotus supermarket on North Pattaya Rd.
For Jomtien, songthaews wait at the beginning of Pratamnak Rd (the continuation of Second Rd, from the South Pattaya Rd crossroads), and charge 10 baht.
For Naklua, take a songthaew up Second Rd to the Dolphin Roundabout (10 baht). If the songthaew turns left or right at the roundabout (i.e., it's not one of the few that continue straight on to Naklua), disembark immediately and cross to the north side of the roundabout, and either walk or take a north-bound songthaew (10 baht) from there.
White coloured songthaews ply Sukhumvit Rd, going as far as Si Racha and Sattahip (20 baht); full-size buses to destinations as far away as <a href="/en/Trat" title="Trat">Trat</a> and even <a href="/en/Chiang_Mai" title="Chiang Mai">Chiang Mai</a> also stop and pick up passengers on Sukhumvit Rd (at the South Pattaya Rd, Central Pattaya Rd, and North Pattaya Rd junctions).
If you're overcharged by a songthaew driver, note the three digit vehicle number (top left corner of the windscreen, also stenciled on both sides and in the back) and report the problem to:
As by march 2012 a local bus line, called Beach Bus, is running a circular line: Pattaya Floating Market - Chaiyapreuk - Jomtien Beach Road - Thappraya â Pattaya Second Road â Dolphin Roundabout â Northern Bus Terminal â  City Hall â Pattaya Beach Road â Walking Street - Thappraya - Jomtien Beach Road - Chaiyapreuk - Pattaya Floating Market. The ticket costs 30 baht. Timetable and further info: <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.pattayafloatingmarket.com/topic.php?pageid=84&amp;opageid=45&amp;userid=1&amp;lang=english&amp;pagename=Beach%20Bus%20Service%20Available">[10]</a>
The quickest way to get around is by motorcycle (<i>motosai</i>). A moto-taxi will be less expensive than a songthaew charter, but arguably less safe. Roadside moto-taxi stands are scattered throughout town, and waiting drivers usually clap their hands or sometimes call out to attract the attention of potential passengers; alternatively just flag down the next available one that cruises by, as the drivers are easily identified by their coloured vests. Some will carry two (or more!) passengers - although this is illegal. Foreigners can expect to pay around 30-40 baht for trips around the inner parts of town.
Although meter-taxis are a common sight in and around Pattaya, very few will accept a metered fare.  All are from Bangkok.  Their drivers bring passengers from the capital and then operate locally until a return fare becomes available.  You should haggle before the journey with whatever fare they've quoted.  The minimum fare for a foreigner is usually 150 baht - even 1 km hops.
Please note that English proficiency amongst taxi drivers is not the highest.  You may want a printout in Thai of your destination.  Some drivers will have a binder listing common destinations in various languages to avoid misunderstanding.
There are also some car services and non-metered taxis that operate on an on-call basis; minibuses can also be chartered. These services are suited primarily to longer trips outside the core of the town or to another city, and can be arranged through most travel agencies and many hotels/guesthouses. Expect to pay considerably more than the cost of a songthaew charter, probably in the order of a few hundred baht.
If you are going back to Bangkok, there is the cheap possibility of catching a taxi which has just came from there (with some passengers) and has to return. Since the driver isnât going to get a passenger as soon as he leaves Pattaya, he might be willing to take back a passenger for cheap which should cost you no more than 800-1200 baht.

Not easy to find a bicycle for rent! There is one shop at the northern end of Pattaya. It is called Kokonok and is located 506/ 50 Soi 16 Pattaya Naklua road.  Dial 080 828 8239 (from the roundabout 4 blocks to the east and one to the north).
Bicycles can be hired more centrally complete with lock, for 75 baht per day from <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.canterburytalescafe.com">Canterbury Tales Cafe</a>, just off Soi Buakhao, near LK Metro. Although cheap, the quality of the bicycles leaves something to be desired.
If considering renting a vehicle, bear in mind that traffic in Pattaya can seem very erratic by Western standards, and that driving on the left can be confusing not only for those who have previously only ever driven on the right, but also for those unfamiliar with the common Thai practice (even the police do this) of motorcycling alongside the kerb on the "oncoming" side of the road, or the wrong way up one-way streets. The latter problem is especially prevalent in the Pattaya Bay area, where the majority of the roads in the main tourism zones are one-way; and the northern section of Second Road requires great care as some treat the right-hand "bus" lane as oncoming, while others do not.
Motorcycle rentals are a very popular way to get around, but not the safest, especially in the case of visitors with limited previous experience of motorcycling and Eastern traffic habits, and even more so in Pattaya given the large number of motorcycle-mounted holidaymakers who seem hell-bent on a Darwin Award. Also note that a motorcyclist carrying a shoulder bag, and anything placed in the front basket of a motorcycle, makes an especially easy target for bag-snatchers. Also beware the "No Parking" signs; fines are typically 400-500 baht.
Motorbikes can be rented without difficulty at countless locations in Pattaya, including many hotels and guesthouses, usually without having to produce a licence; however it's common for foreigners to be asked to deposit their passports as security (to avoid this, simply shop around until you find one of the many places that will accept a photocopy instead); cash deposits are also often required (1000 baht is not uncommon). Motorcycle rentals do not include insurance, and both motorcycling accidents and motorbike thefts are common. Some outlets have a third-party cover which covers you for medical attention. If motorbikes don't carry this insurance they are illegal and should not be entertained. One renter who has this cover is Nittayas who operates from Soi 12 Naklua.
Cars can easily be rented, and are a good way to explore beyond the city limits, but they are not  such a practicable way to get around the busiest central areas as traffic can be congested, and parking spaces can be difficult to find in the evening and on weekends. However, the major supermarkets offer free parking, and low-cost parking is available at the major shopping venues such as Royal Garden Plaza, Central Festival, &amp; Big C on Second Road.
Rentals without insurance start from around 800 baht/day for small cars, and from as little as 600 baht/day for open-top jeeps; cars with insurance start at just under 1,000 baht/day, and come down to around 5,600 baht/week or 18,000 baht/month in low season. High season prices (from early November) are generally a few hundred baht more.
Getting the correct type of insurance cover on any rental car in Thailand is extremely important. Commerical "Car Rental Company" first-class insurance provides the absolute full legal cover (as opposed to limited personal or third party-only insurance cover. Request a copy of the policy document and check that it states "For Commercial Use".
The three kilometres long <b>Pattaya Beach</b> runs along the city centre. The beach is full of life with hotels, restaurants, shopping malls all along the road facing the beach.  The street south of Beach Road, Walking Street, comes alive with rock music as the night sets in. People throng the street to experience the night life, which is unique in all respects. There are hundreds of beer bars, go-go bars, discotheques around the area. Muay Thai, the Thai Boxing, an open arena in some of the beer bars are exciting to the hilt.
Another beach in Pattaya, <a href="/en/Jomtien" title="Jomtien">Jomtien Beach</a>, more popular among family vacationers, is on the southern part of the city, and separated from the main Pattaya Bay by Buddha hill. Jomtien is more calm and serene compared to the crowded Pattaya Beach and a paradise for water sports enthusiasts. Jomtien is also popular for its amusement park and tower, to keep children entertained. The one km long, <b>Wong Phrachan Beach</b>, situated on the Northern part of the Pattaya Beach is a favourite among swimmers.
There are acres of sand jam-packed with recliners and umbrellas (usually with an "in-house" supply of drinks), serviced by an army of laid-back but tenacious hawkers offering anything and everything from food (especially seafood, fruit, ice cream) to massage, manicure/pedicure, tattoos, lottery tickets, newspapers, herbs, flowers, gems, perfumes, sunglasses, CDs, watches, lighters, clothes, toys, souvenirs, handicrafts (it's a bit like TV shopping - as soon as you've declined one offer, it's time to consider another) and so on. Eventually you buy a very dark pair of sunglasses, and after that you just pretend to be asleep.
Pattaya Beach is almost 3 km long and bordered by Beach Road. Due to its central location and proximity to several hundred hotels, and because it's a relatively narrow strip of sand, it's crowded at the best of times (and even more so at high tide). Hefty fines for littering help keep the sand neat and tidy, however the sea is not so clean around here.
The northern end of Pattaya Bay is occupied by <b>Wong Amat Beach</b>, which is accessed from Naklua; and beyond the southern end, around the Buddha Hill headland that separates Pattaya Bay from Jomtien, are several more smaller beaches.
Naklua Bay is immediately north of Pattaya Bay, with Rachvate Cape separating the two. <b>Naklua Beach</b>, to the far north, is the main strip, with the smaller Crescent Moon Beach and then Palm Beach further south. Beyond them is Wong Amat Beach which occupies the northern end of Pattaya Bay, but is accessed from Naklua. All are generally cleaner and more suitable for quiet relaxation than Pattaya Beach.
Pattaya's main beaches are popular and busy places for activities. Some of these include banana-boat rides, jet-skiing, water-skiing, parasailing, windsurfing, and the like; anyone who just wants to enjoy a simple swim or a good splash around with a frisbee or rented inner tube will always find themselves with plenty of company as well.
Pattaya is well known for its <i>katoey cabaret</i> (aka <i>ladyboy</i> or transvestite) shows. Two of the best known (expect busloads of Asian tourists) are:
NB: Some roadside local travel agents offers significantly cheaper ticket prices for the above shows, including for VIP Seats.
Cinemas in Thailand tend to be severely air conditioned - bring a long sleeve shirt, or jacket, or both! Otherwise, the four large mall cinemas in Pattaya are mostly up to Western standards. Some (but by no means all) Thai-language films are subtitled in English (check the billing at the theatre) and some films will have both subtitled and non-subtitled showings. Visitors must stand up during the King's anthem.
Whether youâre a veteran spa and wellness traveler or simply a tourist with a few aches and pains, Pattaya has a place for you. Spa centers and massage shops of all kinds are peppered throughout Thailandâs favorite seaside resort. Just a few examples of whatâs available: all types of massages, including aromatherapy massage, Thai herbal compress massage, Thai foot massage, Ayurvedic massage, hot stone massage and many others; then thereâs body scrubs, detoxification and colonics, body wraps, water treatments, waxing, and facial treatments. A short drive from the bustling capital and you can be pampered for any length of time, and then relax on the beach afterwards.
<b>Day Spa</b>
There are scores of excellent spas in Pattaya, with some of the most popular  being Spa Silavadee, P.S. Spa, The Cliff Spa - Royal Cliff Hotels Group, Royal Garden Spa - Pattaya Marriott Resort and Spa, Amburaya Spa - Sheraton Pattaya Resort, Devarana Spa - Dusit Thani Pattaya and Spa Cenvaree - Centara Grand Mirage Beach Resort Pattaya.
Pattaya is not only one of Thailandâs prime tourist destinations but also one of its leading medical tourism destinations, and is home to more than a dozen private and government-run hospitals. A myriad of choices, attractions, and options are available for those wanting to create a memorable medical holiday, and you would be hard-pressed to find a better place to relax, recuperate, and rejuvenate.
Visitors to Pattayaâs medical facilities can expect highly trained physicians, many having been educated and certified in Western institutions. This means that you are in professional, experienced hands and have the added benefit of many of them speaking English. Many are surprised to find the equipment is equal to or better than that found in their home countries, and the procedures used are all the latest as well.
Visitors should also be advised that most hospitals will advise patients on all aspects of their medical holiday, and if you can, you should contact them in advance to assist you with finding comfortable, convenient accommodations nearby the center, arranging tours before or after your treatment, and especially in choosing the right packages for your specific needs. All this will reduce your expenses even further than they already are.
As far as large, well-appointed and certified international hospitals go in Pattaya, Bangkok Pattaya Hospital (BPH) stands out as the leader, and comes with Joint Commission International (JCI) accreditation. Its resources and staff are impressive by any standard: more than one hundred specialists, fully trained nurses and aids, and a team of interpreters fluent in twenty different languages. In short, this hospital is a leader in Asiaâs medical tourism facilities. <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.mymedholiday.com/country/thailand/pattaya-2f-chonburi">[28]</a>
Of course, there are many other popular hospitals and clinics in Pattaya, and may be more suited to your particular needs, including the Pattaya International Hospital, the Beauty and Aesthetic Center, and the modern Pattaya Royal Beauty Clinic. <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.mymedholiday.com/country/thailand/pattaya-2f-chonburi">[29]</a>
You may not have been thinking about getting dental work done on your holiday, but think again. More and more tourists are realizing that this may actually be the best time and place to take care of those dental procedures youâve been contemplating at home, but had neither the time nor money to attend to. Dentists in Pattaya are very experienced in all the latest dental procedures, and will assist you with any and all of your needs, including crowns, veneers, implants, root canals, extractions, teeth whitening, dentures, fillings, and bridges.
In short, the hospitals and clinics in Pattaya are second-to-none in Thailand, and many feature extensive dermatology centers for locals and medical tourists alike. The bottom line is: whatever treatment or procedure youâve been needing or wanting you can find in Pattaya, with high quality and low costs. <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.thailandmedtourism.com/FileUpload/MultimediaFile/130909045949466.pdf">[30]</a> So go ahead and schedule your medical or dental treatments between all those leisure activities youâll be enjoying, be it fishing, golfing, parasailing, island-hopping, partying, or simply working on your tan. And leave a little wiggle room to extend your holiday after realizing the savings youâve accrued â itâs been known to happen. <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.thailandmedtourism.com/FileUpload/MultimediaFile/130909045753622.pdf">[31]</a>
Speedboat-towed parachute rides are available along the main beaches, and in Pattaya Bay from several large floating platforms with speedboats ferrying customers out from the shore â typically about 500 baht per flight.
As with most coastal towns in Thailand, Pattaya is a good place for diving. The diving is done mostly on the near islands, Ko Larn, Ko Sak, Ko Krok. Once in a while the dive centers go out to the far islands, Ko Rin and Koh Wichai.
The diving off Pattaya is also known for its numerous wrecks: the HTMS Kut, HTMS Kram, the Bremen, and the Harddeep
For those who want adventure combined with the experience of seeing a rain forest canopy, this adventure tour is ideal. It involves ziplining over the forest canopy and getting a thrill that is in a league of its own. The tour operates twice daily: one starting around 07:00 and the other around noon. Total time including travel is about 5 hours of which about 2-3 hours will be spent in the forest. Can be booked through one of the many tour operator shops or on-line at <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.treetopasia.com">[34]</a> Cost can vary from 2,100-2,500 baht depending on where you book, your ability to negotiate and the supply-demand situation.
Training in <a href="/en/Scuba_diving" title="Scuba diving">scuba diving</a> and trips for a wide range of ability levels and interests, certified by a number of different organisations, including both NAUI and PADI, are available through numerous dive shops.
There are numerous malls, supermarkets, bazaar-style markets, and thousands of other shops. Sadly, you'll be seeing a lot of the same stuff over and over again â there's no endless variety in Pattaya. Also, Pattaya is not a good place to go shopping for hi-tech products, such as cameras and computers. Expect to see prices around 50% higher than the best prices advertised in the West. Also beware of buying fake branded and designer goods, since these could be confiscated by customs officers at the airport.
Foreign currency can easily be exchanged for Thai baht at the many exchange booths which can be found in all areas popular with tourists â there are even mobile exchanges/ATMs in specially adapted minivans that are set up as and when and where the need arises. Note that the majority of exchange booths will buy foreign currency but will not sell it. If you need to obtain US dollars, for example if you're going to Cambodia, use one of the larger branches of a major bank, such as the Bangkok Bank branch on Second Rd (almost opposite Soi 6).
ATMs are widely available around the city, however, the vast majority of them now charge a steep 150 baht fee for using foreign cards, on top of what your home bank normally charges. The only exception is Aeon Bank. Their ATMs are located on the ground floor of Carrefour near KFC, Central Pattaya Road (around 400 m up from the Second Rd crossing), near Homework Furniture Mall entrance (just behind Big C at the South Pattaya/Sukhumvit Rd intersection, accessible by 10 baht songthaews parked near the Second Rd intersection), and in Tesco Lotus in South Pattaya. Also at Tesco Lotus on North Pattaya Rd on the ground floor.
There are many bazaar-style markets in Pattaya where you can <a href="/en/How_to_haggle" title="How to haggle">haggle</a> 'till you drop, including:
Just some of the shops you will encounter in Pattaya:
There are many restaurants, food carts, food courts, food markets, motorcyle-sidecar hotdog and meatball vendors, fruit sellers both mobile and stationary, even a roaming coffee peddling tuk-tuk. OK, so the <i>germ theory of disease</i> doesn't yet seem to be widely accepted but don't let that stop you from ordering the sushi. Many (although not all) non-Thai-cuisine restaurants also have at least a limited menu of Thai favourites as well.
Chonburi Province has a lot of fresh seafood and dried fruits. As there are a lot of people from the Isaan region living and working in Pattaya, there is an abundance of northeastern favourites such as spicy <b>papaya salad</b> (<i>som tam</i>) and spicy-sour chopped pork salad (<i>larb</i>).
Pattaya is internationally known for its nightlifeâyou might want to think twice before heading into the insanity that's called Pattaya. Obviously famous as a sex tourist destination, you don't necessarily have to partake in order to experience Pattaya's fun. More and more visitors come over just to see what the fuss is about. There are ample opportunities to dance, drink, and observe humanity even if paid sex is not of interest. Steer clear of the staid hotel bars and head into the warrens of central Pattaya, where nightclubs, transvestite cabarets, coffee shops, karaoke bars, open-air bars and restaurants with live music and entertainment compete for attention. Most of these establishments are located along Pattaya Beach Rd, Pattaya 2 Rd, and in south Pattaya, which is also the city's major shopping area.
Pattaya is especially famous for its <b>beer bars</b>, staffed by "bar girls" who are "for hire" to the tourists and expats who drink there. Popular beer bar pastimes include pool, connect-four and shut-the-box.
<b>Open-air beer bars</b> can be found all over Pattaya, with the biggest and best known concentrations being along and around Soi 7/Soi 8 and Walking St, at numerous points on Second Rd, Beach Rd, Soi Buakhao, and in smaller numbers just about everywhere else, including along the southern end of Naklua Rd. Although the staff of a typical beer bar will usually all be working girls, customers who have no intention of paying a "bar fine" (money paid to the bar so that the girl can leave with the customer) are generally very welcome and indeed make up the majority of the clientÃ¨le. <b>Indoor beer bars</b> can also be found all over Pattaya, the most notorious areas being Soi Yodsak (Soi 6) and parts of Soi Post Office (Soi 13/2). While some of these bars are much more "bar fine" oriented, in most cases customers who simply want to buy drinks are still welcome.
<b>Go-go bars</b> differ from beer bars as they have bikini-clad girls dancing around chrome poles on stages. The main concentrations are along Walking St and the three Pattayaland streets, with more dotted around the most popular beer bar areas. Sightseeing tourists are welcome in go-go bars, however, cameras are not. Signs prohibiting photography are widespread, and a minority of venues require patrons to deposit their cameras with security staff as they enter. <b>This rule is enforced</b>: if caught snapping shots, you'll be lucky if you're only thrown out and not beaten up.
The official closing time in "entertainment zones" is 01:00, although in practice usually somewhere between 01:00 and 03:00, depending on location. However, "closing" is defined as switching off the music and non-essential lighting, and numerous beer bars remain open 24 hours. Bars outside of these zones close around midnight. So, you're passing through Pattaya and you've set aside a few hours to check out the bar sceneâbut where to go? The most popular (and generally the most densely concentrated) beer bar and go-go bar locations (listed south to north) are:
The following go-go and beer bars are a little different from the usual:
There are many roadside bars dotted around Pattaya. Live music (especially popular rock oldies) can be heard at several open-air venues along Walking Street, and at various bars elsewhere.
Pattaya has two types of nightclubsâthose that are on or near Walking Street, and those that are further away. Those on Walking Street are more popular with Westerners accompanied by bar girls, and with bar girls looking for customers.
The best known are:
The ones further away from Walking Street are generally more typical Thai nightclubs: no special area for dancing, but lots of shows and great atmosphere. Admission is usually around 300 baht and includes one free drink.
There is also one club which is not first type, neither second:
Pattaya has an extensive selection of inexpensive mid-range accommodation, and a good variety of more upmarket options. Standard rooms (double bed, air-con, cable TV, refrigerator, hot shower) start from 400 baht/night, and rates are invariably per room, not per person. Soi Buakhao has many relatively cheap guest houses and is popular with long-stay visitors, with other budget places along Soi LK Metro and Soi Honey Inn. Very few of these can be booked online, or appear on hotel booking sites. The cheaper places are often above bars or massage shops, and may therefore be noisy at night. There's generally no need to book in advance.
Like all resort areas in Thailand, hotel pricing is highly seasonal. High season dates vary from hotel to hotel, but typically prices go up considerably during the Christmas-New Year's period (which co-incides neatly with the season of best weather), and are lower between February and October/November. In addition to higher rates during the holiday period, guests staying over Christmas and New Year's Eve will often be required to pay for compulsory "gala dinners" which can substantially increase the cost of the room. In recent years some hotels have started to insist that March is also covered by 'high season' prices â presumably because professional Western visitors are usually free to visit during a long Easter holiday break from work, and are happy to do so despite the worsening weather.
With the exception of large resorts or international chains such as the Hard Rock and Marriott, the lowest rates available from abroad are typically those available from the hotels directly. Except for the least expensive, many will handle reservations via email or a web form. Many will expect a deposit, especially during high season, usually by credit card or bank transfer.
While some hotels do not allow working girls to accompany guests to their rooms, the majority of hotels in Pattaya are used to (and even expect) it â though some "upmarket" hotels may charge a "joiner fee" for unregistered visitors as discouragement. In most hotels, security staff will keep hold of visitors' ID cards until they leave, to help protect the client from possible theft or assault, and to deter prostitutes under 20 years of age from entering the hotel. On leaving, staff will ask the girl if she had any complaints about the client.
For visitors who simply want to sleep soundly, a box of high-grade foam earplugs is a wise investment when staying at many Pattaya hotels. Also be aware that many hotels in Pattaya allow smoking in all rooms. This is nearly universal in the budget range. With the exception of those operated under the auspices of large international chains, those hotels that have dedicated non-smoking rooms will typically only have a few of them. If you are intolerant of tobacco smoke, make sure to inquire directly with the hotels about their policies and the availability of non-smoking rooms.
<br />
For most people, the most hazardous aspect of visiting Pattaya is the traffic. The top three accident black spots are:
Most accidents in Pattaya involve motorbikes, and are especially common late at night and in the early hours of the morning, when drunk driving is a significant problem. Be careful on the roads, even if you're just crossing one on foot (and be equally careful both on and off pedestrian crossings, as Thai drivers generally ignore them, and many foreigners seem to approach them with the hope of scoring double points); be careful on the pavements too. Obstacles apparently purpose-engineered to trip up as many people as possible are commonplace, and motorcyclists use footpaths as short cuts with impunity. When riding in the back of an otherwise empty songthaew, it's probably safest to sit directly behind the cab.
In the event of an accident, the injured are usually bundled into the back of the next available songthaew.
A completely different genre of traffic-related accident was highlighted by a fatality in January 2006 when a surfacing diver was hit by a speedboat propeller near <a href="/en/Ko_Laan" title="Ko Laan">Ko Laan</a>. Unfortunately, the popularity of Pattaya's beaches combined with a relatively relaxed attitude to safety concerns in general means that swimmers and divers (and even sunbathers on the beach!) being struck by speedboats and jet skis is not such a rare occurrence.
Some of the scams to be wary of:
The <b>main police station</b> is on Beach Road (at the corner of Soi 9); dial 191, or â +66 38 420-802(-5). For Bang Lamung Police Station, dial â +66 38 221-331.
The <b>Tourist Police</b> (â 1155, <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.tourist.police.go.th/">[103]</a>) relocated from Second Road to new purpose-built offices on Pratamnak Road â they are now located next door to the Tourist Authority of Thailand (TAT) Information Office, exactly 1 km south of the junction of Second Road and South Pattaya Road â proceed along Pratamnak Road, continue straight up the hill, and where the road bears sharp right part way up, turn sharp left into the small side-soi. Alternatively, their mobile minivan office which sets up every evening at the junction of Walking Street, South Pattaya Road, and Beach Road is much easier to reach.
The Pattaya Tourist Police advise that in theory foreigners should carry their passports with them at all times, however they also suggest that in practice a good photocopy (personal details page, visa and entry stamp pages, and TM card) is acceptable.
Like most of Thailand, Pattaya is generally safe for tourists and violent crime such as mugging or robbery is unusual, with the exception of jewellery and bag snatching (usually with the thieves on motorcycles, and often with the victims on motorcycles too) which is endemic.
Beware of lady boys approaching you with questions ("Where you from?") and later she and/or her friend try to kiss you just in order to snatch your jewellery. In fact leave all your gold and valuables at the room safe or even at home.
Watch out when doing water sports at the beach areas. There is a common tourist trap where tourists going for jet ski-ing are being forced to pay for equipment damages (which are not caused by the tourists) amounting up to 100K baht. Even after negotiations and intervention from the related embassies and agencies, a payment of around 10K baht is still required for the damages. Thus, you must exercise extreme caution when doing equipment loans or doing sports on vehicles provided by the shops.
Swindles and pickpocketing are more commonly encountered by tourists. It is very inadvisable not to tell <i>anyone</i> that it is your first visit to Thailand, since you will then be marked down as an 'easy touch'.
The nightlife/entertainment areas have a lot of activity and are generally very safe, however <b><a href="/en/Pickpockets" title="Pickpockets">pickpockets</a></b> are a problem, especially on Walking Street when it's crowded, despite the official Tourist Police patrolling the area at night. For this reason, a visitor should not carry a passport and/or credit card with them, especially at night. These should be left in the safe at your hotel along with the bulk of your cash, or if they must be carried then they should be securely concealed. If you have been pick pocketed and then you actually spot the likely pickpocket departing, do not follow. You could be mistaken, and you almost certainly <i>will</i> be accused of being mistaken. Just put it down to experience, and leave the immediate area.
Never ever 'pick a fight' in any circumstance, no matter how much you have had to drink. Never try to intervene, even verbally, in an argument between two or more Thai people.
No matter how much you are being pestered, just smile and walk on. In cash payments, disputes over the value of notes and the amount of change can be avoided by carrying smaller notes and trying to give near enough the exact amount.
The beach side of Beach Road used to be worth avoiding late at night, however the entire length of both the promenade and beach are now floodlit, and although it's still a popular haunt for "freelance" working girls, it's now much busier from dusk through until dawn and by no means a "no-go" area.
Visitors should not visit entertainment venues that do not display a long-standing fixed sign outside, or which appear to be very poorly lit inside. Also, one or two of the hundreds of seemingly bright and established venues may actually be operating as a 'clip joint', offering free admission and then refusing to allow visitors to leave until they have settled a faked bill for non-existent drinks. Again, it is wisest simply pay up, leave and put it down to experience.
As always, travellers should take extra care in all poorly lit or more remote areas, and very late at night. This is especially the case if one has had too much to drink.
Most reputable hotels will require the presentation of ID cards by guests. Throughout Pattaya guests will not be admitted to hotel rooms if they are under the age of 20.  This is a useful way for tourists to guarantee that their new-found friend is actually the age he/she says she is, and thus avoid possible police attention.
<b>Drugs</b>: as in all of Thailand, the penalties for possession and/or distribution of drugs are harsh.
<b>Gambling</b>: is illegal in Thailand, and the local press reports Pattaya Police as having a "zero tolerance" policy for gambling offences.
The legal minimum age for customers in drinking establishments and discos is 20. In Pattaya this is rarely enforced for foreigners, but is frequently enforced for Thais, including those accompanying foreigners. Pattaya police conduct raids to check for underage employees (especially in "indoor" and go-go bars) and patrons (especially in discos) from time to time, and less frequently to enforce closing times. Foreign tourists are not the targets of these raids and are usually asked to produce ID (photocopy of photo/ID page of passport will normally suffice) and then allowed to leave, but are sometimes tested for drugs via an on-the-spot urine sample.
Internet access is widely available in Pattaya, and speed and reliability of the connection is generally good; however, as is the case throughout Thailand, quality varies. The majority of Internet shops tend to open late and close late, but many are open 24/7; prices range from 120 baht/hr down to 20 baht/hr. One baht/min is typical for predominantly tourist-oriented shops, many of which also offer lower rates for pre-paid blocks of time. It's not difficult to find well-equipped, quiet, air-conditioned Internet cafÃ©s that charge 30 baht/hr if you shop around a little; likewise shops that can accommodate users who want to hook up their own laptops can easily be found. Printing (black/white) is usually 10 baht/page (30 baht/page for colour).
Many Internet cafÃ©s and photo-processing shops have facilities for off-loading digital photos from memory cards and burning them to a CD, for which the going rate is 100 baht per CD. As always, carefully verify the integrity of the images on the CD before re-formatting the memory card, and consider having two copies burned to CD â one CD to send home by mail, the other CD to take home in your luggage as a backup.
The area code for Pattaya is <b>038</b>. You only need to dial the 0 if you're calling from within Thailand.

If you need money sent to you urgently then there are many Western Union agents located throughout Pattaya. If you regularly visit Thailand or for extended periods then it might be worth opening a local bank account to avoid the high ATM charges for International bank cards as well as fluctuating exchange rates.
Pattaya has several foreign language newspapers; most come out weekly. The English newspapers include <i>Pattaya Times</i>, <i>Pattaya Today</i>, <i>Pattaya Mail</i>, and <i>Pattaya People Weekly</i>. Additionally, there are French, Norwegian, German, Russian and Japanese publications. There are also several tourist magazines and nightlife, most of them coming out monthly.
The <b>Pattaya Immigration Office</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.pattaya-immigration.org">[112]</a> is now housed in new premises near the inland end of Soi 5, Jomtien Beach Road. Opening hours are 08:30-16:30 weekdays, 08:30-12:00 (extentions/notifications only) on Saturdays (â +66 38 252-750); casual but smart attire is OK, however entry in swimwear or without a shirt is not permitted.
<b>Entry permit extensions</b> are processed on a same day (if applied for before noon â collect after 15:00) or next working day (if applied for after noon). On Saturdays, previous applications can be collected, and new applications can be submitted (for collection next working day). For most nationalities, a 30 day entry permit stamp will usually be extended to 45 days (whereas in Bangkok only an additional 10 days will be given) and a 60 day entry permit stamp will usually be extended to 90 days (further extensions beyond 90 days are also possible). In all cases, the entry permit extension fee is 1,900 baht, and two passport photos must be supplied. Photocopies (5 baht) and photos (100 baht for two) are available from a shop inside the immigration office compound (these prices are about four times as much as can easily be found elsewhere). Note that entry permit extensions are discretionary, and must be applied for in person. Shorter extensions are likely to be issued to nationalities who do not qualify for "visa free" entry; longer extensions are issued in certain circumstances.
Various online and print resources give Pattaya addresses for Kuwait Airways, Orient Thai/Orient Express/One-Two-Go, and Thai Russian Air Service â however all these offices have been closed. The following airlines still have offices in place:
Small laundry services abound, charging by the piece.  Prices start at 5 baht/underwear, 8 baht/shirt, 10 baht/trousers,15 baht/jeans; if you have a lot, a few will charger larger loads by weight. All hotels and guesthouses worth their salt also cater for this, although prices tend to be higher -- starting about double the above at inexpensive places, running up to international chains and similar large splurge properties where it can run well above 100 baht/piece.
In smaller and more informally managed accommodation, the maid who cleans your room will probably welcome the opportunity to boost her meager salary and do your laundry by hand, typically for a few baht more than an outside laundry service. Usually it's a next day service, but might take a little longer if it rains.
