<b>Zurich</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.zurichtourism.ch/">[1]</a> (German: <i>ZÃ¼rich</i>, ZÃ¼rich German: <i>ZÃ¼ri</i>) is the largest city in <a href="/en/Switzerland" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>, with a population of some 390,000 in the city proper and 1.2 million in the agglomeration area. Zurich is on Lake Zurich, where the lake flows into the River <i>Limmat </i>, in the north of Switzerland.
Contrary to a generally wrongly made assumption, Zurich is <i>not</i> the capital of Switzerland -- that honor falls to <a href="/en/Berne" title="Berne">Berne</a>. Zurich has long been known for being clean and efficient. Due to this, it has been continuously ranked as the city with the highest living standard world-wide for many years. However, only for the last fifteen years it has truly become a fascinating and worthwhile travel destination. This is mostly thanks to the liberalization of the party (more than 80 clubs are open at weekends) and gastronomy sectors (over 500 bars and more than 1500 restaurants). An increasingly cosmopolitan population has helped (every third inhabitant is a foreigner), as well, though more button-down <a href="/en/Geneva" title="Geneva">Geneva</a> remains Switzerland's most culturally heterogeneous city. Zurich always used to be well known for a demanding audience in opera/ballet, classical concerts, and theater. You find more than 50 museums and over 100 galeries in a inner city circle. Traditionally, the majority of all 59 movie show rooms show a diversity of international and arthouse cinema productions mostly shown in their original languages with German and French subtitles.
The official language is (the Swiss variety of) Standard German <a class="external autonumber" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_Standard_German">[2]</a>, used in all official publications and announcements, or in any written form, and practically everyone can speak it, but the native spoken language of the masses is Swiss German <a class="external autonumber" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_German">[3]</a>. The most common dialect is called <i>ZÃ¼ridÃ¼Ã¼tsch</i> (<i>ZÃ¼rich German</i>), though quite mixed up with any of the many Swiss German dialects, because of Zurich's central importance and hence its high fluctuation. English and French are also quite widely spoken and often used in official publications and announcements alongside German. Any of these languages will do easily. Note that it is often wise to speak Standard German rather than attempting to speak Swiss German; some people may think you are trying to make fun of their language.
<b>Zurich Airport</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.zurich-airport.com">[4]</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IATA" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:IATA">IATA</a>: <b>ZRH</b>) (German: <i>Flughafen ZÃ¼rich-Kloten</i>) is Switzerland's largest and busiest airport run with Swiss efficiency. The airport is actually part of the municipality of <a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Kloten&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Kloten (page does not exist)">Kloten</a> and a brief 12 minutes train ride from central Zurich. Trains run every few up to 12 minutes. Early in the morning and late at evenings trains run a bit less frequent, so if you travel at these times check the schedules here <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.zvv.ch/en/">[5]</a> (<b>ZVV</b>: Zurich's city and suburban public transport system), or here <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://fahrplan.sbb.ch/bin/query.exe/en">[6]</a> (<b>SBB-CFF-FFS</b>, the Swiss country-wide integrated ticket and public transport system by the <i>Swiss Federal Railways</i>).
The railway station is to be found at the lowest underground level <i>G02</i> of the adjacent airport shopping center just accross the street of the arrival gates (<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.zurich-airport.com/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-317/">[7]</a>). A single ticket to <i>ZÃ¼rich Hauptbahnhof</i> (central railway station in Zurich, on time tables usually listed as: <i>ZÃ¼rich HB</i>) costs CHF 6.60 for 2nd class (full fare) and is valid for 1 hour, a return ticket costs CHF 13.20 and is valid from the airport to the city and within the city for 24 hours. Kids under 16 pay the half fare, kids under 6 travel for free if accompanied by an adult. There are also reduced multi-day tickets for youth under 25 at the SBB ticket booth.
You can board any kind of train, since the ticket is valid for ANY kind of public transport (including <i>SBB-CFF-FFS</i> trains, <i>S-Bahn</i> (suburban trains), tram, bus, boat and cable cars) within on the ticket indicated areas, the so-called <i>fare zones</i> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.zvv.ch/en/routes-and-zones/fare-zone-plan.html">[8]</a>: <i>zone 121</i> for <i>Zurich Airport and environment</i>, and <i>zone 110</i> for <i>Zurich City</i> for the ticket from the airport to the city. Be aware that the zones <i>110</i> for <i>Zurich City</i> and <i>120</i> for <i>Winterthur</i> count double in price calculations.
Also take into consideration ZVV's special tourist offer <i>ZurichCARD</i> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.zvv.ch/en/tickets/tickets-and-prices/zuerich-card.html">[9]</a>, a ticket valid, either for 24, or for 72 hours, for the whole area of Zurich city and its adjacent zones <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.zvv.ch/opencms/export/sites/default/common-images/content-image-gallery/tickets-pdfs/Plan_Geltungsbereich_ZuerichCARD_2012.pdf">[10]</a>, including free access to all Zurich museums, either for CHF 24.-, or CHF 48.-. Though, no half-fare discounts are avilable for them.
Make sure that you have a valid ticket <i>before</i> you board the train, or whatever vehicle, and that the ticket is valid for the respective class, either <i>1st</i> or <i>2nd</i> class, if you travel by train; indicated by large big number <b>1</b> or <b>2</b> on the coaches' exteriour, <i>1st</i> class is also indicated by a <i>yellow stripe</i> along the 1st class seats outside the coaches. Fines for travelling without any ticket, or a wrong ticket, even for the wrong class, can be hefty (around CHF 100.-)!
There is also a tram (tramway/streetcar) line No. 10 (colored pink) running between the airport and the city centre, a 37 minutes ride to <i>Zurich HB</i>, valid with the same ticket (only 2nd class necessary), though eventually gives you a better first insight into Zurich <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.zvv.ch/en/routes-and-zones/city-zurich.html">[11]</a> and its adjacent suburban area, since running exclusively above ground and through the streets of the communities. Several bus lines connect to the airport and provide access to the suburban area <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.zvv.ch/en/routes-and-zones/zvv-network-plan.html">[12]</a> as well as the <a href="/en/Winterthur" title="Winterthur">Winterthur</a> region <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.zvv.ch/en/routes-and-zones/city-winterthur.html">[13]</a>.
The bus terminal and the tram(way) stop are to be found at ground level south of the airport shopping center at level <i>G1</i>, the top most level of the shopping center <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.zurich-airport.com/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-317/">[14]</a>.
Most major airlines fly to Zurich, but <b>SWISS</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.swiss.com">[15]</a> is still the Swiss flag carrier and covers the biggest part of the international traffic at the airport. Almost every large hotel in Zurich provides shuttle buses from the airport to your hotel. The stops for these buses are a short walk to the right from the arrival 1 gate <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.zurich-airport.com/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-315/">[16]</a>.
Zurich Airport has high passenger costs due to several noise reduction and approach restrictions. Most no-frill airlines fly to EuroAirport <a href="/en/Basel" title="Basel">Basel</a> which is 1 1/2 hour away by train and airport bus. <b>EasyJet</b> resumed its flights to Zurich in 2007 after a three year absence and <b>Air Berlin</b> offers several flights to Germany and Southern Europe.
If you are travelling without a Schengen Visa to another destination in Europe (via Zurich airport) and if you are not European citizen, you must not stay in Europe for longer than 90 days - even if your final destination would allow citizens of your country to stay for more than 90 days. Failure to do so will lead to very high fines (around 8100 Euros) should you try to leave Europe via Zurich airport.
Regular trains to and from other Swiss and European cities leave from and arrive at <b>Hauptbahnhof</b> (<b>HB</b>), the main railway station, conveniently located in the city centre at the beginning of Bahnhofstrasse, with easy access to mass transit (map: <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.sbb.ch/content/sbb/en/desktop/bahnhof-services/am-bahnhof/standort/shopville-railcity-zuerich/ueber-uns/_jcr_content/relatedPar/contextmenu_1/downloadList/station_plan_.spooler.download.pdf">[17]</a>). The <i>Zurich Hauptbahnhof</i> is served by suburban (<b>S</b>-Bahn), regional (<b>RE</b>) and long-distance trains (<b>IR</b>, <b>IC</b> and <b>ICN</b>) with connections throughout Switzerland, Germany's <b>ICE</b>, France's <b>TGV</b>, and various other direct (night) train services to/from as far as Amsterdam, Hamburg, Berlin, Frankfurt, Cologne, Dusseldorf, Essen, Hanover, Munich, Stuttgart, Rome, Lecce, Milano, Paris, Barcelona, Salzburg, Linz, Vienna, Budapest, Zagreb, and Beograd.
<i>Zurich's Main Station</i> is an extremly high busy passenger node. There are between 350'000 to 500'000 commuters daily taking usage of this central network node. Put this into relation to Zurich's amount of inhabitants: around 400'000. Regarding the amount of trains daily entering and leaving a single railway station, <b>ZÃ¼rich's Hauptbahnhof</b> is <b>the world's most frequent railway station</b>: 2915 trains every day!
For train time tables and tickets (see <a href="/en/Switzerland#Public_transport" title="Switzerland">Switzerland's public transport hints</a>), visit the <b>SBB-CFF-FFS</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://fahrplan.sbb.ch/bin/query.exe/en">[18]</a> website, although it would sometimes be advisable to book international journeys online through the respective websites by the operating railways (e.g.: France's TGV <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.tgv-lyria.com/main/FCK/File/site_en/network_map/network_map.asp">[19]</a>, Germany's DB <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.bahn.de/i/view/GBR/en/index.shtml">[20]</a>, Austria's ÃBB <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.oebb.at/en/index.jsp">[21]</a>, Italy's Trenitalia <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.trenitalia.com">[22]</a>), especially regarding pre-booking deduction possibilities. If you are already in Europe, your local railway station office should usually be able to book these trains. A rail pass may make your trip cheaper.
The SBB railway station and the connecting underground mall <i>RailCity ZÃ¼rich</i> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.sbb.ch/en/station-services/am-bahnhof/railway-stations/shopville-railcity-zuerich.html">[23]</a> has shops, restaurants, and grocery stores, which locals use when they need to do Sunday shopping, as it is not subject to the closing hours laws otherwise in force in Switzerland. It also hosts a Christmas market around Christmas times.
Among the 16 railway stations (and 10 additional stops) within Zurich's city borders, there are other five major passenger railway stations. Three of them belong to the five most frequented railway stations in Switzerland.
<b>ZÃ¼rich Oerlikon</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.sbb.ch/content/dam/infrastruktur/trafimage/bahnhofplaene/plan-zuerich-oerlikon-a4.pdf">[24]</a>, in the north from the center, connecting an old industrial quarter turned into an evolving business center around the station and Zurich's fastest growing business and living quarter <i>ZÃ¼rich Nord/Stettbach</i> north of it and midway on the way to the airport. Trains from/to the airport, the northern suburbs, Winterthur, St. Gallen, Schaffhausen/Rhine Falls, Stuttgart, Munich, Salzburg and Vienna run through this heavy commuter railway station. The direct InterCity trains <i>Zurich Airport - Basel</i> (does not serve Zurich HB) and <i>Zurich Airport - Luzern</i> (stops in Zurich HB) stop here as well.
<b>ZÃ¼rich Stadelhofen</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.sbb.ch/en/station-services/am-bahnhof/railway-stations/station-plus/zuerich-stadelhofen.html">[25]</a>, just squeezed between two tunnel ends, is Switzerland's third most frequented railway station (135'000 commuters per day), though it has only three tracks. It had been rebuilt 1991 by star architect <i>Santiago Calatrava</i> along with the introduction of Zurich's S-Bahn network. Nowadays, it is already again a bottle neck with up to 40 trains per hour serving mainly S-Bahn lines for a fast connection with <a href="/en/Winterthur" title="Winterthur">Winterthur</a> and Zurich's Oberland, as well as for the S-Bahn connection with the lines at the Lake Zurich's east shore up to <a href="/en/Rapperswil" title="Rapperswil">Rapperswil</a>. Its central location just next to <i>Bellevue</i>, the opera and the lake does not make it less important for both, the working people, as well as the culture/fun commuters. In its underground you also find a small mall.
<b>ZÃ¼rich HardbrÃ¼cke</b>, looks more like a people underpass, because it is located exactely below the <i>HardbrÃ¼cke</i>, a street bridge connecting <i>Kreis 3</i> and <i>Kreis 4</i>, otherwise by many train tracks seperated quarters, is another bottle neck in Zurich's S-Bahn network. Just next to Switzerland's tallest building and again a commuter's culmination point just about 4 km west of Zurich HB. During the day it serves the evolving business quarter of the 1990ies, at evenings and especially at weekends, Zurich's most pulsating party area.
<b>ZÃ¼rich Altstetten</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.sbb.ch/content/dam/infrastruktur/trafimage/bahnhofplaene/plan-zuerich-altstetten-a4.pdf">[26]</a> in the west of Zurich, serves an old blue collar quarter <i>Altstetten</i>, which already turned itself also into a more lively white collar business center during working hours, is also on the capillary route to Bern - Lausanne - Geneva, Basel - Paris/Frankfurt/Hamburg/Berlin/Amsterdam, and Biel-Bienne/NeuchÃ¢tel (Swiss Jura).
<b>ZÃ¼rich Enge</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.sbb.ch/en/station-services/am-bahnhof/railway-stations/station-plus/zuerich-enge.html">[27]</a> at the <i>Tessinerplatz</i> in the south, west of Lake Zurich's shore, impresses with its old building from 1927 made of Ticino's granite and serves only S-Bahn commuters mainly from Lake Zurich's west shore, but is on the major route to Chur/Davos/St. Moritz (Grisons/GraubÃ¼nden), Salzburg - Linz - Vienna - Budapest/Beograd, Luzern, Arth-Goldau - St. Gotthard - Ticino (Bellinzona, Lugano) - Milano. It also provides a small 365-day shop.
The <b>other railway stations</b> within city borders are called (clockwise from south-west to south-east): <i>Wollishofen</i> (<i>S8</i>, <i>S24</i>), <i>Leimbach</i> (<i>S4</i>), <i>GiesshÃ¼bel</i> (<i>S4</i>), <i>Wiedikon</i> (several S-Bahnen), <i>Selnau</i> (the underground, below the <i>Sihl</i> river station of the <i>S4</i> and <i>S10</i>), <i>Affoltern</i> (<i>S6</i>), <i>Seebach</i> (<i>S6</i>), <i>Wipkingen</i> (several S-Bahnen), <i>Stettbach</i> (several S-Bahnen), and <i>Tiefenbrunnen</i> (<i>S6</i>, <i>S16</i>).
The four stops within city borders of the <i>S10</i> up to the <i>Ãetliberg</i>: <i>Bienz</i>, <i>Friesenberg</i>, <i>Schweighof</i>, and <i>Triemli</i> (one of the city hospitals). The three additional stops (within city border) of the <i>S4</i> into the <i>Shiltal</i> (valley): <i>Saalsporthalle</i>, <i>Brunau</i>, and <i>Manegg</i>. The three stops of the <i>Forchbahn</i> <i>S18</i> shared with the Tram No. 11 (within city border): <i>Hegibachplatz</i>, <i>Balgrist</i> (several hospitals), and <i>Rehalp</i>, besides its starting point <i>Stadelhofen</i>.
Almost every highway in Switzerland leads straight into Zurich. This might be quite easy for tourists, but is also really painful if you have to cross Zurich on a daily basis.
Long distance coach services (Swiss Standard German term: <i>Car</i>) normally end at the coach terminal next to the main railway station, where the river Sihl flows into the river Limmat.
Note: Do not confuse the blue/white ZVV buses, which are part of the local public transport system <i>ZVV</i>, with long distance coaches, mainly used by extreme low-cost travellers to and from traditional blue color countries.
Many coaches arrive there from other European cities, mainly southern destinations like the <a href="/en/Balkans" title="Balkans">Western Balkans</a> or <a href="/en/Spain" title="Spain">Spain</a>. There is a bi-weekly bus to <a href="/en/Banja_Luka" title="Banja Luka">Banja Luka</a>, <a href="/en/Bosnia_and_Herzegovina" title="Bosnia and Herzegovina">Bosnia and Herzegovina</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.autoprevoz.org/engleski/redvoznje.php">[28]</a> 
(look for "Cirih").
As Zurich is located at the end of lake Zurich, it can be reached by boat from other lake villages, e.g. Rapperswil at the upper end of the lake.
ZÃ¼rich is famous for its highly efficient, clean and safe public transport system, owned by the several municipal transport agencies and managed by the <i>ZÃ¼rcher Verkehrsverbund</i> (<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.zvv.ch"><b>ZVV</b></a>), which covers the entire canton of ZÃ¼rich, plus some municipalities in bordering cantons for the passenger's convenience (in fact the <i>18x</i> fare zones and some stops in zone 155). The network includes trams, buses (local city/municipality buses as well as the yellow bright Swiss PostAuto buses), suburban trains (S-Bahn), regular trains (SBB), cable cars and boats. The size and complexity of the network may be daunting at first, but you will soon realize that there are dozens of ways to get from one place to another and following any of them will still be efficient. ZVV's transport system is coherently and comprehensively integrated (fare-wise and timetable-wise) into Switzerland's Federal Railways system <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.rail.ch">SBB-CFF-FFS</a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.postbus.ch">Swiss PostAuto bus network</a>, and any cities/area's local bus and tram system of the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.zvv.ch/en/routes-and-zones/">covered area</a>.
Timetable information for any public transportation in Switzerland is available on <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.sbb.ch">sbb.ch</a> or can be obtained using <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.sbb.ch/en/timetable/mobile-timetables/mobile-apps.html">SBB's free smart Phone apps</a>, which also informs you about any train's position or delay in real-time. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.zvv.ch/en/timetables/mobile_timetable/">ZVV's own free app</a> delivers you timetable information and real-time updates about ZVV's transport system condition and any delays. All of them require a working internet connection. The free <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://itunes.apple.com/ch/app/wemlin/id293648832?mt=8">Wemlin App</a> gives you offline access to timetable information and network maps for the canton of Zurich area without internet connection and is therefore ideally for on the go usage in case you do not want to use data roaming.
The system is divided into numerous <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.zvv.ch/en/routes-and-zones/fare-zone-plan.html">fare zones</a>, with the Zurich's city centre and innermost suburbs being in <i>zone 110</i> and the outer suburbs located in other zones (<a href="/en/Winterthur" title="Winterthur">Winterthur</a> is in <i>zone 120</i>, for example), and the more zones you pass through, the more you will have to pay for your journey. There are single tickets, day cards, monthly cards and annual cards. The monthly and annual cards are collectively referred to as <i>ZVV NetworkPass</i>.
<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.zvv.ch/en/tickets/">Tickets</a> must be purchased from a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.zvv.ch/en/tickets/automatic-ticket-machine/index.html">ticket vending machine</a> before boarding or from one of the ticket selling kiosks. The ticket vending machines are in German, English, French and Italian and offer almost all regular tickets available. They come along with a zone map on every machine as well as clear instructions coming to your aid, so feel free to choose! Once you have got your ticket it gives you access to all modes of transport.
If you are staying for a longer period, consider a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.zvv.ch/en/tickets/tickets-and-prices/zvv-networkpass/index.html">monthly ZVV NetworkPass</a>, because even though there are no regular tickets valid for something between one day and a month, it takes only ten <i>zone 110</i> day cards for a <i>zone 110</i> monthly card to be cheaper. When travelling in all zones, it takes only eight day cards for the monthly card to be cheaper. A 24-hour ticket (marketed as a <i>Day Pass</i>) for <i>zone 110</i> costs the same as two single rides. Be aware of that the two zones for the city of Zurich (<b>zone 110</b>) and for the city of Winterthur (<b>zone 120</b>) <b>count double in calculating the fare</b>!
If you do not mind starting your travels after 9:00, the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.zvv.ch/en/tickets/tickets-and-prices/zvv-9-oclock-pass/index.html">9 o'clock-Pass</a> is the best option. It is available as both daily, monthly and annual cards and will save you a lot of money compared to regular similarities, especially given that the 9:00 rule does not apply on weekends. It takes only 5 9 o'clock day cards for an all-zone 9 o'clock monthly card to be cheaper.
For travels between the canton of ZÃ¼rich and the neighbouring cantons, you use a so-called <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://zpass.ch/en/zpass/index.html"><b>Z-Pass</b></a>, available as daily, monthly and annual cards as well as single tickets. The <i>Z-Pass</i> system also has its fare zones <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://zpass.ch/en/zpass/zonenplaene.html">[29]</a>, even in the neighbouring transport regions and can be used in ZVV's covered area plus one of the neighbouring local transport regions/cantons (Aargau: <i>A-Welle</i> / zones 5xx, Schaffhausen: <i>Flextax</i> / zones 8xx, Schwyz and Zug: <i>Schwyz-Zug</i> / zones 6xx, St. Gallen and Thurgau; <i>OSTWIND</i> / zones 9xx). Z-Pass tickets and cards cannot yet be bought from the ZVV ticket vending machines.<br />
The restriction is that you can only combine <b>one</b> additional transport region with ZVV. So if you are not going to one neighbouring region more frequently than the others, you are probably better off with just an appropriate ZVV card and buying an additional Z-Pass single ticket/daily card for the not covered zones of your ZVV card to your final destination's zone, which is often cheaper than buying a single ticket all the way from your departing place.<br /> 
<b>Attention</b>: your chosen vehicle of transport must have a stop in one of your ZVV ticket's valid zones. Its last stop within your ZVV's card/ticket valid zones will then count as the point from where you have to add additional <i>Z-Pass</i> zones, or buy a point-to-point ticket. This does not work with with all (inter-)regional (RE, IR) or most long-distance (IC, ICN, EC) trains, which do not usually stop in one of your ZVV's card valid zones (except in Zurich HB, Zurich Airport, Winterthur, and sometimes Oerlikon and Thalwil), so you would have to buy a normal point-to-point ticket. S-Bahn and R, however, are local trains and usually stop at every station, or at worst far more often, so your chances of getting a cheaper ticket are better. Z-Pass officially claims: "The condition is that the mode of transport used stops within one of the <i>ZVV</i> fare zones given on the <i>Z-Pass</i> ticket".
<br />
For all details regarding fares, see <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.zvv.ch">zvv.ch</a> (in German) or <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.zvv.ch/en">zvv.ch/en</a> (in English). Also, staffed service desks called <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/en/index/tickets/ticket_offices/vbz_ticket_offices_and_kiosk.html">Ticketeria</a> are available at the major tram hubs, if you need assistance in choosing the right travel pass for your needs. You can also ask the personel at the ticket counters in any of the <i>SBB-CFF-FFS</i> railway stations as they sell ZVV tickets as well.
The Swiss Pass by <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.swisstravelsystem.com/en/home.html">Swiss Travel System</a> is valid on all public transport in Zurich and, if you are a tourist visiting most of Switzerland, this may be your best way to saving both money and time spent trying to figure out zones, routes, and fare options. Eurail passes are valid only on the S-Bahn and boats. Interrail passes are valid on the S-Bahn (although the ZVV website claims a "reduction" for other routes for Interrail holders). Nevertheless, you may find you do not need the trams and buses if you do not mind walking around a little.
Several tram lines and buses (most of them electrified) cover the city at street level. Like all other public transport in Zurich, you purchase and validate tickets <i>before</i> boarding, or risk a fine if they decide to spot check. You can find a schedule at every stop which is  accurate to the minute, and are most of the time accurate. However these schedules can be missed, because of snow, wet leaves on the tracks during autumn, or exceptional traffic can mix up the schedule. But this does not really matter, since their frequency is that high (every 7 to 15 minutes) you just wait for the next. Check <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.zvv.ch/en/timetables/mobile_timetable/">ZVV's free mobile app</a> for updated real-time infos, or listen to the annoncements, available at many stops.
The <i>S-Bahn</i> is ZÃ¼rich's convenient and fast suburban rail system which covers nearly all suburbs of ZÃ¼rich and beyond. All lines except the rural ones pass through the Hauptbahnhof. The ZVV offers directions <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.zvv.ch/en/leisure/">[30]</a> for a series of excursions on the S-Bahn.
You must have a validated ticket before you board. If you do not have a ticket you will be liable for an on-the-spot fine (around CHF 100.-).
There are two types of boat-based public transport operated in ZÃ¼rich: river buses and lake steamers. The river boats operate in the summer months only and the lake boats operate on a much reduced schedule during the winter.
The river buses operate between the Landesmuseum (near the Hauptbahnhof) along the Limmat River and out in the ZÃ¼richsee (ZÃ¼rich Lake) to Tiefenbrunnen. There are several stops along the Limmat River.
The ZÃ¼richsee Schifffahrtsgesellschaft (ZSG) <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.zsg.ch/">[31]</a> operates lake steamers which leave from Burkliplatz (at the end of Bahnhofstrasse). The ZSG's website provides information on destinations and ships. The ZSG offers a variety of tourist-oriented trips (including Jazz Brunch, and historic restored steam ships), and a popular trip is to Rapperswil at the south end of the ZÃ¼richsee. The town has a beautiful castle overlooking the lake surrounded by a medieval town.
ZVV fares apply to both boat service lines.
<br />
Regular bus, tram and S-bahn service ends around half past midnight. Past that time, a bus and S-bahn based <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.zvv.ch/en/timetables/nighttime-network/">nighttime network</a> is available on weekends and connects in 30-minute intervals the main hubs within the city and the greater Zurich region. Passengers require a valid ZVV ticket plus a <b>night supplement</b> (CHF 5.-) to be purchased <i>before you board</i>. Tickets can be purchased from any ticket machine or by SMS from a swiss mobile number.
The main train station, old town and the lake promenade and all nearby tourist attractions are easily walkable. You may find that you don't need transport for most of your tourist needs once you get into the city.
You can "rent" bikes, skateboards etc. for free from 7AM-9:20PM daily May-Oct at several places in Zurich and year-round at the central train station. All you need is your passport and a CHF 20 deposit as guarantee. This offer is called "ZÃ¼ri rollt (<i>German only</i>)"<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.zuerirollt.ch">[32]</a>. You can get and return the bikes at several locations: the bikegate just next to the central station, next to the "Globus City" shopping centre, next to the opera, or at the Swissotel in Oerlikon. If you can't find these places, don't hesitate to ask some locals, they should know at least the bikegate at the central station. The Zurich Transit Company, VBZ also provides information about these bikes in English <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.vbz.ch/vbz_opencms/opencms/vbz/english/FreeBikes/">[33]</a>. Nevertheless, you shouldn't count on it because sometimes the "rent" spots run out of bikes.
Driving in Zurich is possible, but it is painful as the city centre is not easy to navigate by car by north-americans or Australians, who are not used to such conditions. See also <a href="/en/Switzerland#By_car_2" title="Switzerland">Switzerland's recommendations for driving</a>.
Most of the interesting sights are in the <a href="/en/Old_town" title="Old town" class="mw-redirect">old town</a> around the river and lakefront.

Switzerland has a very strict labor market. You will need a work permission visa and promotion from an employer.
For citizens of the EU-25 countries the bilateral agreements makes it easier to gain a temporary work permit typically for 5 years that is renewable if you have worked. Often a 1 year permit is issued to EU applicants, as such candidates can repeatedly renew even these 1 year permits. Legally, EU applicants have the same status as Swiss applicants when applying for jobs (employer does not need to justify hiring them, and must hire them in preference to non-EU/non-Swiss applicants if skills are equivalent).
For all other citizenships you need a company behind you and you must have skills that are rare in the Swiss (or EU!) labor market.
Working without permission can lead to a night in prison and deportation depending on you and the agreement with your home country.
For shopping in ZÃ¼rich there are three different areas in the centre:
You may be disappointed to know that most of the cheap watches and clocks in Switzerland are imported from China and Japan for their cheap quartz movements (including most of the wall clocks and alarm clocks sold at department stores, for example). Don't purchase a "Migros Budget" clock for 8CHF thinking it is a Swiss clock! Nevertheless, real Swiss-made clocks are still well-known for their quality and reliability, and intricate mechanics. The following are true Swiss-made watches:
Chocolat Frey is accessible by taking S-Bahn line S3 to Aarau (42 min) and then the local bus number 1 to the stop "Industrie" (8 min). It offers factory tours on request for groups of at least 12 persons at a small fee per person. It is 100% Swiss and produces as one of the few Swiss manufacturers from bean to bar. It also is present in more than 50 export markets. In Export it is besides the Frey branded chocolates very often also available under Private Label offers such as those from Marks &amp; Spencer, Loblaw, Tesco, Coles, Woolworths and many more.
The Lindt factory used to offer tours and free samples, but this is no longer the case.
The larger Coop supermarkets carry many brands, including <b>Lindt</b>, <b>Camille Bloch</b>, <b>Goldkenn</b>, and others, including all sorts of alcohol-filled chocolates.
The quintessential ZÃ¼rich dish is <b>ZÃ¼rigeschnÃ¤tzlets</b>, chopped veal in a cream and wine sauce, normally served with <b>RÃ¶sti</b>. Various kinds of grilled <b>WÃ¼rste</b> (sausages, <i>singular:</i> <b>Wurst</b>) are also popular. These are most often accompanied by boiled potatoes, or <b>RÃ¶sti</b>, a kind of hash-browns, just much better (boiled potatoes then grated, then pan fried in butter until crisp) or <b>Chn&#246;pfli</b> (small noodle dumplings, in Germany  called <i>SpÃ¤tzle</i>).
In general many kind of different meat (veal, beef, pork, lamb and mutton, chicken and other poultry meat, or even horse (considered to be very delicious and of high quality), and rabbit and venison during hunting season in autumn) you can find in many various dishes. In quality-aware restaurants they originate from a personally known, local source and are normally served with fresh, local and seasonal vegetables, besides standard side dishes.
<br />
While <b>Fondue</b> (melted cheese in a central pot, dip bread into it) and <b>Raclette</b> (cheese melted in small portions, served with potatoes and pickles) are not really local to ZÃ¼rich (they originally come from the western French-speaking Switzerland) and consumed by locals only during winter season, they are available at some restaurants aimed at tourists even in summer.
The <b>bread</b> available in ZÃ¼rich is generally delicious. There are many varieties, and your best bet is to go to a bakery or a supermarket in the morning or just after work hours, when most people are doing their shopping and bread is coming out fresh. A typically Swiss bread is the <b>Zopf</b>, a braided soft bread made from white flour, milk, eggs, butter and yeast that is commonly served on Sundays (the other name for it is <b>Sonntagszopf</b>, or in High German <b>Butterzopf</b>), or its luxury version called <b>Buurezopf</b> (Farmer's Zopf) made with <i>Buuremehl</i> (Farmer's flour, a combination of wheat and rye) instead of white flour only.
Try grilled <b>Bratwurst</b> from street stands, served with a large crusty roll of sourdough bread and mustard, or sandwiches made with fresh baked <b>Bretzeln</b> (large, soft pretzels; an original Bavaria treat and just recently "imported" by a shop chain).
For breakfast, try a bowl of <b>(Bircher-)MÃ¼esli</b>, which was invented by Dr. Bircher as a health food in Switzerland. The SprÃ¼ngli confectionery store tea rooms serve a deluxe version of this fiber-filled cereal with whole milk, nuts, fruits such as crushed berries and cream.
There are a huge variety of <b>cheeses</b> available at the supermarkets, specialty stores and markets, as well as all kinds of <b>hams</b> and <b>dried sausages</b>. Dairy products are generally delicious, especially the <b>butter</b> and <b>yoghurts</b>. Do not miss the supermarkets! You should take a thorough look through Migros or Coop and maybe even assemble your own lunch or dinner some time. Even the cheap, budget prepackaged desserts in the supermarket exceed the quality of what you may be used to.
Generally, locals prefer local and seasonal produces, though the prices for them are usually higher. The demand of so-called <b>Bio</b> products (aka organic products) is so high that local farmers cannot fulfill it, and therefore a large part of organic produces is imported, but probably come along with less thorough quality checks than Swiss are usually used to.
For those with a sweet tooth, there's a huge variety of <b>chocolates</b> to enjoy, from the cheapest chocolate bar to individually hand-made truffles. (See the Shopping section above). The chocolate bar displays at the supermarkets will overwhelm you! Also enjoy <b>pastries</b> and <b>cakes</b> from the various <b>Konditorei</b> scattered around town. In pastry shops, you can also find special pastry from Zurich: The most famous of them probably is <b>Tirggel</b>, a rather hard pastry made of flour and honey. Although traditionally made and eaten during the Winter holidays, many pastry shops (including larger supermarkets) sell them throughout the year. Often, they've got sights of Zurich printed on the top, can be stored for months and thus make up a pretty good and cheap souvenir. Another famous type of pastry are <b>Luxemburgerli</b> exclusively sold by the confectionery chain of SprÃ¼ngli (part of the famous chocolatier Lindt &amp; SprÃ¼ngli). A typical cake is the <b>Mandelfisch</b>, an almond cake shaped like a fish.
Like most European cities, ZÃ¼rich abounds with <b>CafÃ©s</b> where you can enjoy a leisurely cup of coffee, glass of wine or other beverage, and watch the world go by.
There are many international dining options available, too. The current hot trend seems to be pan-Asian noodle/rice/sushi places. However, due to the far distance to the sea and the lack of original, well-trained Chinese/ Japanese cooks, the quality cannot live up to that of the original countries. Instead, the Italian cuisine holds the highest popularity among the foreign restaurants. They can be found throughout the city and are relatively cheap. Turkish fast food restaurants are also a delicious, cheap option.
Vegetarian food is easy to find throughout the city. Vegans may have a little trouble because cheese is used generously in most food, but should be fine living off supermarkets at the very least. <b>Hiltl</b>, the first vegetarian-only restaurant in Europe, is also worth a visit. You choose from the buffet, where your meal is priced by weight or from a variety of Ã  la carte menus, which are a bit more pricey, but include vegetarian/vegan versions of popular Swiss meals like ZÃ¼ri-GschnÃ¤tzlets or Beef Stroganoff amongst Indian food and classic vegetarian plates. Another vegan friendly restaurant is "Bona Dea", which is located directly at Zurich's main railway station.

Zurich has a lot of places to go out. There are a lot of clubs (around 80 at weekends), restaurants, <i>CafÃ©s</i>, bars (around 500) but also many museums and theaters, one opera and two classical concert halls. The most common drinks in Zurich/Switzerland include: Beer (consumation in CH in 2011: 4.6 mill. hectoliter (hl) <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.bier.ch/deu/kennzahlen-marktaufteilung-ch.html">[74]</a>) and wine (2.7 mill. hl, 1/3 white and 2/3 red <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.eav.admin.ch/dokumentation/00445/00582/index.html?lang=de&amp;download=NHzLpZeg7t,lnp6I0NTU042l2Z6ln1acy4Zn4Z2qZpnO2Yuq2Z6gpJCDdYF9gmym162epYbg2c_JjKbNoKSn6A--">[75]</a>).
During the last 20 years, virtually all of the large Swiss breweries have been closed by or sold to huge, foreign owners. Nevertheless, as a kind of counter-mouvement, numerous tiny and small regional breweries have been founded and are extremely successful, especially in Zurich (such as: <i>TurbinenBrÃ¤u</i>, <i>Amboss</i> (<i>Back und Brau</i>), or <i>HirnibrÃ¤u</i> <a class="external autonumber" href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z%C3%BCrcher_Brauereigeschichte">[76]</a><a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://bovbeers.wordpress.com/2011/05/02/bier-braucht-heimat-und-das-lohnbrauen-syndrom/">[77]</a>). Another well known Swiss beer and quite well known in Zurich is <i>Vollmond</i> by <i>Brauerei Locher, Appenzell</i>.
There are many different sites at which local wine is being cultivated and produced (Lac LÃ©man (a majority of white wine: 68% Chasselas), Valais, Ticino (mainly red ones), around the three lakes of NeuchÃ¢tel/Biel/Murten, Grisons in order just to name a few major sites). Local productions are almost exclusively consumed locally, only 1-2% are being exported. In avarage, a Swiss citizen drinks 50 bottles of wine every year <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/leben/essen-und-trinken/Ein-Schweizer-konsumiert-50-Flaschen-Wein-im-Jahr/story/24777877">[78]</a>. Because of the high local request, prices can be quite high. About 170% of the local production quantity is being imported from different areas: France and Italy (34% each), Spain (14%), and Germany (4%), but as well as from Portugal or South Africa <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.eav.admin.ch/dokumentation/00445/00582/index.html?lang=de&amp;download=NHzLpZeg7t,lnp6I0NTU042l2Z6ln1acy4Zn4Z2qZpnO2Yuq2Z6gpJCDdYF9gmym162epYbg2c_JjKbNoKSn6A--">[79]</a>. There are countless many local culinary products you can enjoy, often depending on where you are: <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.kulinarischeserbe.ch/default.aspx?page=ucSearch">[80]</a>.
At <i>ApÃ©ro</i> time (after work, but actually meaning: informal meeting normally accompanied with alcoholic beverages and some snacks), you will find many people drinking a <i>CÃ¼pli</i> (Swiss German term for a glass of Champagne).
Zurich has proportionally more clubs than any other city in Europe. You will find anything from very "fancy" clubs to places you can just chill. If you want, you can go to a club every night. There is always a Club that has a party going and Zurich's young make sure to splash all their income on going out.
A lot of clubs are located in the so called Zurich West (District 5). The internet site <b>usgang.ch</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.usgang.ch">[91]</a> is a good place to look up what's up.
Zurich is the financial centre of Switzerland and most travellers come with an expense account. The hospitality sector focuses therefore mostly on the 4 and 5 star sector. Zurich is known for its superb hotels, but these won't come cheap. Best is to go on a company rate, because rack rates are sometimes ridiculous.
<br />
Zurich has numerous camping sites, in true Swiss style they are usually very clean, all the sites are the the southern end of the city, normally in river valleys (for obvious reasons). Most campsites close for the winter.
ZÃ¼rich, like most cities in Switzerland, is relatively safe. Nevertheless, be on guard for thieves and pickpockets. Carry your wallet or purse in a secure way, not in your hip pocket or a backpack outer pocket. In particular, thieves are known to operate around the Zurich main train station. Do not let your bags out of sight for even a moment.
In recent years, certain areas along the lakefront are frequented by young people who sometimes try to pick a fight when they are drunk. Do not let them provoke you, as they are likely to be there in numbers and will use any excuse to go at you. You may also notice many of said young people smoking something that isn't a cigarette - Switzerland is surprisingly lenient about such things - but it is hardly a cause for alarm.
Public transport is very safe. You can use it without any special precautions.
If you decide to bicycle in the city, understand that Zurich is a city of public transport . Beware of tram tracks which can get your wheel stuck and send you flying into traffic, of the trams themselves which travel these tracks frequently (and may scare you into getting stuck into the track as just noted), and the buses, which make frequent stops in the rightmost lane. In short, bicycling downtown should be only done by those experienced with cycling with such traffic.
Permanence Hauptbahnhof at the main train station provides urgent out-patient care for tourists without prior appointments. <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.permanence.ch/">[135]</a> There is also a dentist downstairs at the station. For serious emergencies rush to "Kantonsspital", the university clinic which has a 24/7 emergency ward. Tram stop "UniversitÃ¤tsspital" (look out for the golden boy in front, then follow the red "Notfall" signs). They will not send away people with serious, urgent health problems. Ambulance phone number is 144.
If you're on a budget, don't stay out too late â the "N" night buses only run on weekends. When they run, they run only once per hour and you must purchase a Nachtzuschlag for 5 CHF from the machine and validate it before boarding. On work nights, there is no public transport at all after about 12:30AM (although expensive taxis still exist in case you're stuck).
Stores are generally closed on Sundays including all supermarkets in the city, except those in the main train station and airport.
On Sundays, there are supermarkets open at the following train stations: Zurich main station, Enge, and Stadelhofen.
Avoid reaching/visiting Zurich on 1 May. The city is on a Labor Day/May Day holiday. The trams don't run for half the day so getting around could be a problem. Also, there could be some minor violent outbreaks and damages to cars.
Zurich has two police departments, the Stadtpolizei Zurich which is responsible for the city area and the Kantonspolizei ZÃ¼rich which is responsible for the whole region. With approximately 1800 and 3000 employees, these departments are the biggest in Switzerland. While police officers in Zurich will happily help you out if you are in trouble or need an information, they are also known for approaching "suspicious" persons in order to check their papers. This procedure is annoying, but legal as you will probably have a hard time proving you were not acting suspicious. Carry a photocopy of your passport and your onward ticket with you, stay calm and polite and you probably won't have much trouble.

Access to most other parts of Switzerland is extremely easy, thanks to the efficient and frequent SBB train system. Other locations easily accessible from Zurich worth a complete visit in their own right include:
From Interlaken, take the Berner Oberland Bahn to Lauterbrunnen, then Wengernalpbahn to Kleine Scheidegg and finally the submountain railway Jungfraubahn.
