<b>Baku</b> is the capital of <a href="/en/Azerbaijan" title="Azerbaijan"> Azerbaijan</a>.
<b>Baku</b>, also known as <b>Baky</b> or <b>BakÄ±</b>, is the largest city in the <a href="/en/Caucasus" title="Caucasus">Caucasus</a> and the capital of <a href="/en/Azerbaijan" title="Azerbaijan">Azerbaijan</a>. Baku is on the coast of the Caspian Sea on the southern tip of the Absheron Peninsula. There are three major divisions in Baku: <i>Ä°Ã§Éri ÅÉhÉr</i> (the ancient city), the Soviet built city, and the newest part of the city. The population as of January 2012 was 2 137,200.
A curious fact about Baku is that its average year-round temperature (14.2Â°C/57.6Â°F)) matches the average temperature of the <i>entire</i> landmass of the earth to within a tenth of degree. Summers are hot and humid, winters cool, wet and breezy. However, seasonal temperature excursions are less than in many continental regions at this latitude (about 40 degrees north) owing to the presence of the Caspian Sea.
<b>Heydar Aliyev International Airport</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.airport.az/">[1]</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IATA" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:IATA">IATA</a>: <b>GYD</b>) is situated 25 km (15 mi) from Baku city centre. It is served by major airlines including Aeroflot, Austrian Airlines, Azerbaijan Airlines, British Airways, Turkish Airlines, Lufthansa and Qatar Airways, and a whole host of smaller airlines. One of the least expensive ways to get between Baku and <a href="/en/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a> is via Aeroflot, with inexpensive flights to/from <a href="/en/Moscow" title="Moscow">Moscow</a> daily. Air Baltic also offers flights with good prices from/via Riga. From June 2013, low-cost carrier Wizz Air will commence flights to Baku from Budapest<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://wizzair.com/en-GB/about_us/news/wizen167">[2]</a>.
Bus N16 runs between the airport and Samed Vurgun Park, in the heart of Baku. The trip costs 1AZN and takes over an hour.
Minibus 135 runs between the airport traffic circle (15-min walk from the airport) and the 28 May Metro Station. The journey takes an hour and costs 0.40AZN.
Getting a smooth ride from the airport to town can be a hassle. The lowest price you can get for a taxi to the centre should be around 15 Manat (old Lada, unmarked taxi). Be aware that there is one single taxi company that is allowed to officially do business at the airport. This monopoly drives up the price to nearly 50 Manat and many times it leaves you with no other options, especially when arriving at late hours. Police occasionally force out all cab drivers trying to do business on the fringes of the airport, leaving you stuck with a high fare.  Taxis don't have meters so you must negotiate in advance.  If you are not finding a reasonable price, go out of the airport, past the taxi stand, and ask the cabbies in the far end of the parking lot.  Be cautious since the majority of Baku cabs are unmarked.  Don't let the cab driver renegotiate the price with you.  It is a common trick to ask for much more on arrival to your destination.  You are not obligated to pay what they demand.
For 5 Manat you can take a cab from the airport to Metro Koroglu (former Azizbeyov). From there it's four to six stations to the city centre - but only from 6AM until midnight.

Domestic trains are very cheap, most journeys cost less then 3AZN which makes it cheaper then staying in an hostel.
However, it is important to note that the border between Russia and Azerbaijan is <b>closed for non-CIS nationals</b> for the forseeable future. So unless you're a national of CIS then this journey is impossible.
Buses run between Baku and <a href="/en/Lankaran" title="Lankaran">Lankaran</a> (departs: 11:50AM, 3PM, 4PM, 5PM), Sheki (hourly, 4AZN, 7-hr trip). International buses also operate from destinations in <a href="/en/Iran" title="Iran">Iran</a>, <a href="/en/Turkey" title="Turkey">Turkey</a> and from Tbilisi. A common rule of thumb for bus rates in Azerbaijan seems to be about 1AZN per hour ride. Example: Agstafa is about 7 or 8 hours away from Baku. About 8AZN.
Minbuses operate between Baku and Sheki (6 hr), <a href="/en/Lankaran" title="Lankaran">Lankaran</a> (5 hr), Xachmaz (3 hr), <a href="/en/Saatli" title="Saatli">Saatli</a> (5 hr), and <a href="/en/Imishli" title="Imishli">Imishli</a> (4 hr).

Make sure you have appropriate visas before embarking, if necessary.
A great way to cover a lot of ground is to use a bicycle. But because of its lunatic car drivers and the chaotic traffic, Baku is not really a great town to get around in by bicycle. Except for the up-town, the city, including old town (<i>Ä°Ã§Éri ÅÉhÉr</i>) and downtown is almost dead flat, and though there are some streets that are safe to ride, there is almost always a chaotic and dangerous amount of traffic on the road.
There are no separate bike lanes on the streets, no way of using the sidewalk with super high gutters (10"+) curbed in stone and no pram or stroller ramps so the streets are not designed for rolling objects. So cars and cyclists are forced to share the streets of Baku. The city centre is considered not to be bike-friendly and the locals strongly advise against it. The traffic over the past few years has become seriously chaotic and congested with hostile, incompetent and completely inconsiderate drivers. There were more than 285 deaths and 1185 injuries recorded last year (2012) just for pedestrian crossings. The actual figure for deaths is estimated to be closer to 1000+. The reason for this ridiculously high figure can be seen on any street in Baku. Its been estimated that more than 40% of drivers have never actually sat and passed their drivers licence test, but simply just 'acquired' one.
While cycling on the street is not recommended, except for the clinically insane, the Boulevard on the other hand offers an amazing place to stretch out. The new area of the Seaside Boulevard was opened in May 2012 and extends from the 'Baku Sports Palace' (BakÄ± Ä°dman SarayÄ±) to the 'National Flag Square'. There is a car park near the Sports Palace and is the perfect starting point. The length of the new boulevard is approximately 5kms. There are wide open terraces to explore all the way up to the flag with lovely restaurants, pubs and lounge-cafe's all along the way. This is soon to be extended in the other direction once the new Holiday Inn is completed on the foreshore and this will provide up to 10kms of scenic and traffic-free biking. Bike and pedal car rental is available on the Boulevard at a cost of 3AZN for 2hrs and 1AZN per hour after that. Pedal cars cost slightly more.
While Baku is a safe place, make sure to get a good lock (or two), and to use it if you intend to stop. If you are looking for a road, mountain or trekking bike, then there is a bicycle rental shop at the city centre called MyBike (Address: Asef Zeynalli Street, Ichari Shahar). If you want to know the best routes, you should get a copy of the beautifully designed 'Baku by Bike' plan, which is available at all bike rental points of MyBike.  Bike rental costs about 10-20AZN per day (approximately, AZN 1 = â¬1, as of 2012).
A passport or identity card must be shown and a refundable deposit is required.  While this service is quite convenient, be sure to bring ID or passport and contact information, including hotel phone number, to speed up the paperwork.
There are a lot of English and American ex-pats here in Baku so Mountain Biking is popular and there are some great rides to be had further out of town in the foothills. While these will test your ability on the other hand they will provide a stunning view of Baku city and the Caspian.
There are a number of 'clubs' or organised rides along the boulevard and into the hills. The bike shops can provide more details.
While different to back home, bike riding in Baku can be one of the most rewarding past times ever.
Buses and minibuses cost 0.20AZN per person and can take you to almost any place within Baku. Destinations are usually posted on the front and the right side of the bus.
The metro goes to many places throughout Baku and it costs only 0.20AZN. It is the least expensive way to get around Baku besides walking. Ask a cashier or attendant. You must obtain a <i>BakÄ± Metropiliten Kart</i> (2AZN refundable deposit) and load it like a normal metro pass. Alternatively, you can use a <i>Azerbaycan Sosial KartÄ±</i> like the ones on some Azerbaijani ATM cards. The metro workers will be more than happy to help if spoken to in either Azeri or Russian, and some may understand English.
Be careful when transferring trains at the transfer stations (28 May and Jafar Jabbarli) as the signage is not easy to spot.
There have been reports of people being arrested while taking photographs of the metro station.
The Baku electric train runs through several parts of Baku and the surrounding area including <a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Sumqait&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Sumqait (page does not exist)">Sumqait</a>. 1AZN.
It is possible to get around Fountain Square, the Boulevard, and the old city by foot, but the entire city cannot be covered on foot.
The Azeri government recognises its traffic problems and hazards for pedestrians in Baku and has built an extensive network of underground pedestrian walkways to ensure pedestrians do not attempt to cross the roads. Numerous deaths and near misses have been recorded of people attempting to cross the road without using the underground walkways. They are everywhere in the city, especially near the Boulevard and look like subway entrances often with escalators, stairs and pram or stroller ramps. It is highly recommended you locate them and use them.
English and Russian are understood in many places throughout Baku, but it wise to still either bring an Azeri phrase book and/or brush up on your Azeri/Turkish/Russian before arriving. However, about 80% of population at least understands Russian, and about half the people under the age of 35 will speak at least a little English. Turkish is mutually intelligible with Azerbaijani, so people will likely understand you as long as you stick to simple words and speak slowly, although it may be a little bit harder for Turkish speakers to understand Azerbaijani than the other way around.
English is well catered for in most shops, restaurants and bars as a result of 15+ years of expats from the oil industry. Very easy to make yourself understood with little local language skills.

There are a number of interesting sites within Baku's walled fortress, the <b>Old City</b> (a <a href="/en/UNESCO_World_Heritage_List" title="UNESCO World Heritage List">UNESCO World Heritage site</a>), which can all be seen on foot in one day:
Outside the city, on the <i>Absheron Peninsula</i>, there are several interesting sites that are easy to reach via taxi or public transportation. Moreover, the scenery along your route is itself a fascinatingly ugly sight to be seen, a desert wasteland with white salt flats and natural oil pools seeping up to the surface.
<br />
There are a couple of beaches including <b>Shikhov Beach</b>, but they are polluted by sewage and industrial waste. Outside the city, however, there are a few very nice sandy beaches on the Caspian. In particular <b>BilgÉh</b> and <b>Amburan</b> beaches, on the north coast of the Absheron Peninsula are great spots to cool off from heat.
There are a great deal of restaurants in Baku.
<b>A Cultural Note</b><br />
Although tea houses (<i>Ã§ay xanalar</i>) in Baku usually allow Western women to enter, in the regions, it is often forbidden for females to enter such establishments. Women drinking in Baku is a la mode, but it is taboo for women in the regions of Azerbaijan to consume alcohol.
There are many outdoor tea houses (<i>Ã§ayxanalar</i>) that serve tea and sweets to people in their own individual nooks.  Going to them can be a great way to get a sense of the local culture.  If you are adventurous, try challenging a local Bakuvian to a game of backgammon (nard) or dominoes.
There is a good selection of cafÃ©s dispersed throughout Baku.  Expect to pay Western prices for your coffee.
Although tea houses (<i>Ã§ay xanalar</i>) (found throughout Azerbaijan) serve local beer (<i>piva</i>) - draft at 50 qapick/glass or bottles at 70 qapick/bottle or vodka (<i>araq</i>) at 2AZN/bottle, for anything exotic (e.g. tequila, gin, or rum), you will have to go to a normal bar or hotel and pay Western prices there.

Internet cafes in Azerbaijan are called "internet klubs" and they are found throughout Baku. Some coffee houses provide wireless internet, but they are quite rare in Baku. Recently public wi-fi service was implemented the central areas.  One "klub" with fast internet downtown is VIP, U.Bunyadzade 3.  They also have a lot of games you can play.
Azerbaijan Post locations are dispersed throughout Baku. Mailing an international letter generally costs 0.8AZN.
As Azal seems to be in a permanent state of flux as to where their offices are located, pop into a travel agent and ask about tickets very carefully before buying anything.  In some cases, like Naxcevan or last-minute flights, you WILL ABSOLUTELY have to go this every-moving central office during a few random opening times in order to get your tickets processed.  One travel agent who can guide you buy phone is reachable at +994 55 4201220 or +99412 5551320 or 5981619.
Baku is considered a safe city,  nevertheless common sense is useful as in all other big cities. Homeless people do not harass or attack people and are very safe to be around. The <b>biggest</b> problem in Baku is driving. Many drivers do not obey rules and speed.
You must speak in Azeri, Turkish or Russian to communicate your needs. It would be a good idea to memorize key phrases before coming to Azerbaijan - see the <a href="#Talk"><b>Talk</b> section</a> for phrasebooks.
The roads can be treacherous at night due to unseen potholes and dimly lit cars. Most areas in and near the downtown are mostly safe. There are some underpasses under particularly busy roads (some with escalators), and some zebra crossings and traffic lights. Watch out for traffic police if otherwise crossing a busy road, they may try to fine you 20AZN for a traffic offence (even though the locals do it constantly.)
Try to stay away from the outskirts.
