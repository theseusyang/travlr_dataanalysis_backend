<b>Macau</b> (also spelled. <i>Macao</i>, æ¾³é, <i>Ou3 Mun4</i> in Cantonese, <i>ÃomÃ©n</i> in Mandarin) <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.macautourism.gov.mo">[1]</a> is a Special Administrative Region (SAR) of <a href="/en/China" title="China">China</a>.  Located across the Pearl River estuary from <a href="/en/Hong_Kong" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a>, until 1999 Macau was an overseas territory of <a href="/en/Portugal" title="Portugal">Portugal</a>.  One of the world's most densely populated spots, Macau is best known as Asia's largest destination for <b>gambling</b> taking in even more revenue than <a href="/en/Las_Vegas" title="Las Vegas">Las Vegas</a>.
As the first and last European colony in Asia, Macau has more visible colonial history than Hong Kong. Walking through the old city you could convince yourself you were in Europe - if the streets were devoid of people and Chinese-language signage, that is. The Portuguese and Macanese population continues to maintain a presence, but most of the population is native Chinese.
Besides the city itself, Macau includes the islands of Taipa and Coloane, which are connected to Macau by bridges and to each other by a causeway, now built up into the Cotai Strip. The Chinese city of <a href="/en/Zhuhai" title="Zhuhai">Zhuhai</a> borders Macau to the north, and the border crossing carries heavy two-way vehicular and pedestrian traffic. The Zhuhai Special Economic Zone extends south to Hengqin Island, an area west of Taipa, Cotai and Coloane; the Lotus Bridge from Cotai connects to that area. There is significant movement by the local population of both Zhuhai and Macau across the border, making the two feel like twin cities.
Macau is subtropical with hot summers and mild winters. Visitors should note that typhoons often strike from mid-summer to Autumn which could stop many activities there. Although winter is generally mild, there are occasional cold fronts which could make temperatures drop 10Â°C (50Â°F) in a day.
In the 16th Century, China gave Portugal the right to settle in Macau in exchange for clearing the area of pirates under strict Chinese administration. Macau was the first European settlement in the Far East. It became Portuguese colony effectively after the treaty signed by Qing and Portuguese Government in 1887. It was also the last, when pursuant to an agreement signed by China and Portugal in 1987, Macau became the Macau Special Administrative Region (SAR) of China on 20 December 1999, ending over 400 years of Portuguese administration.
China has promised that, under its "one country, two systems" formula - Macau is officially the same country with mainland China, but maintain its own ruling systems. Like its neighbour Hong Kong, Macau still does not have a full democracy and the locals often think that there is too much control or influence from Beijing (more one country, less two systems).
In recent years, Macau's economy has bloomed rapidly due to the opening of the gambling licenses. Thousands of tourists are in Macau each day, mainly from mainland China and neighbouring regions. The standard of living in Macau has as a result grown significantly, and in many cases, on par with some European countries. The tourist industry has also diversified - instead of casinos, Macau is also promoting its historic sites, culture and cuisine.
<b>A Macao Narrative</b> (<a href="/en/Special:BookSources/0195920708" class="internal mw-magiclink-isbn">ISBN 0195920708</a>) by Austin Coates. Great introduction to Macau's colourful history. You can buy this book at the museum in the Fortaleza do Monte which overlooks the Ruins of St. Paul.
Macau was geographically divided into three regions: the peninsula and two islands. However, reclamation of the area between Taipa and Coloane has created the fourth region of Cotai.
For many years, the usual way to get to Macau was to fly into Hong Kong and take a ferry across to Macau. Today, Macau is becoming a low-cost airline hub, and some are now arriving at Macau to later go to Hong Kong.
<b>Minimum validity of travel documents</b><br />
Macau has a <b>separate</b> immigration regime from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. All travellers from mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan (Republic of China) and all foreign countries have to go through immigration and customs checks on arrival in Macau. Therefore, if you want to re-enter the Mainland from Macau, you'll have to re-apply for another Chinese visa unless your earlier one is a multiple entry visa. While Hong Kong and likewise Macau are officially part of the PR China don't let this cause confusion, they are still designated SAR or Special Administrative Regions operating under their own immigration controls, currencies and autonomous governments. Furthermore, an entry permit to Hong Kong is not valid in Macau and vice versa.
Holders of a Hong Kong <i>permanent</i> identity card or a re-entry permit can enter Macau visa-free for up to 1 year <b>without</b> having to present their passport. Holders of a Hong Kong <i>non-permanent</i> identity card can enter Macau visa-free for up to 30 days and <b>must</b> present their passport.
Foreign nationals of the following countries/territories can enter Macau <b>visa-free</b>:
<b>For up to 180 days:</b> United Kingdom
<b>For up to 90 days:</b> All <b>European Union</b> member states, plus Albania, Andorra, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Cape Verde, Croatia, Dominica, Egypt, Ecuador, Grenada, Iceland, Israel, Japan, Lebanon, Liechtenstein, Macedonia, Mali, Mauritius, Mexico, Mongolia, Montenegro, Norway, Serbia, South Korea, Switzerland and Tanzania
<b>For up to 30 days:</b> Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, India, Indonesia, Kiribati, Malaysia, Monaco, Namibia, New Zealand, Philippines, Russia, Samoa, San Marino, Seychelles, Singapore, South Africa, Thailand, Turkey, the United States and Uruguay
In addition, all foreign visitors who intend to enter Macau for less than 48 hours for the purpose of travelling onwards to another destination via Macau International Airport are <b>exempt</b> from obtaining a visa.
If you require a visa, it can either be obtained from a Chinese embassy or consulate or on arrival in Macau (Macau visas are separate from visas valid for travel to Mainland China). A <b>visa on arrival</b> costs MOP100 (individual), MOP50 (children under 12; per person for groups of 10 or more travellers with a collective travel document) or MOP200 (family passport). A visa issued on arrival is valid for <b>multiple</b> entries within 30 days of the issuing date. This is a very quick and cheap way of getting visa and definitely preferable over applying to embassy.
<i><b>However</b></i>, Bangladeshi, Nepalese, Nigerian, Pakistani, Sri Lankan and Vietnamese citizens <b>cannot</b> use the visa on arrival facility (unless they hold a Hong Kong identity card) and <b> must</b> apply for a Macau visa at a Chinese embassy in advance or at the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.fmcoprc.gov.hk/eng">Commissioner's Office of the Chinese Foreign Ministry</a> in Hong Kong if they live there. The application form for a Macau visa if applying for one at a Chinese embassy or at the Commissioner's Office of the Chinese Foreign Ministry in Hong Kong is available at <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.fsm.gov.mo/psp/cht/pdf/psp_top6/psp_top6_sim_03_1_cp.pdf">[2]</a> and the application fee is USD30 (plus USD20 if the embassy has to refer the application to Macau). The standard service takes 5 working days to process the visa application (if the embassy needs to refer the application to Macau, the application takes 3 weeks). An express service (3 working days) is available for an additional USD20, while an 'extra express' service (same or next working day) is available for an additional USD30 (the express/'extra express' services are not available if the embassy needs to refer the application to Macau). More information is available at this <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.fsm.gov.mo/psp/eng/AfMV.html">webpage of the Macau SAR Public Security Police Force</a>.
All travellers who enter Macau (regardless of whether visa-exempt or not) may be required to show they have a minimum of MOP5000 to fund their stay and possess a valid return or onward journey ticket. The only exception to the return/onward journey ticket requirements is for residents of Hong Kong or mainland China, but not if they use a Hong Kong SAR or Chinese passport to transit through Macau to a third country/territory.
<b>Lost/stolen travel documents:</b> If your travel document is lost or stolen while you are in Macau, you should follow the procedure detailed at this <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.fsm.gov.mo/psp/eng/LoTD.html">webpage of the Macau SAR Public Security Police Force</a>.

This is still the main way in which most visitors get to Macau <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.macaocenter.com/Ferry%20to%20Macau.html">[6]</a>. The main ferry terminal in Macau is the <b>Macau Ferry Terminal</b> (<i>Terminal Maritimo</i>) at the Outer Harbour (Portuguese: <i>Porto Exterior</i>, Chinese: å¤æ¸¯). This is a busy terminal handling most of the sea traffic between Macau and Hong Kong as well as the Chinese ports of Shekou and Shenzhen International Airport. <b>Getting there/away:</b> Buses 1A, 3, 3A, 10, 10A, 10B, 12, 28A, 28B, 28BX, 32 and AP1 run from the ferry terminal. The bus stop is on the main road to the right as you walk out of the building. Pick up a free bus schedule in the tourist information centre in the building. If you are heading straight to a casino or hotel, most of these establishments provide free shuttle buses. They gather to the left of the terminal building; step out of the arrival-level of the building and turn left.
There is a lesser known ferry terminal in Macau, located at Pier No. 11 at the Inner Harbour (Portuguese: <i>Porto Interior</i>, Chinese: åæ¸¯). This is a new ferry terminal building after its former Pier 14 site was given to developers by the Macau Government. It is very near to the Macau city centre and can be easily reached on foot. This terminal mostly services boats to Shenzhen, Jiangmen and Wanzai across the Inner Harbour in Zhuhai.
A third temporary ferry service serves Taipa, Cotai and Coloane connecting to Hong Kong and Shekou. The Taipa Temporary Ferry Terminal is adjacent the Ponte da Amizade Friendship Bridge on Estrada de Pac On, and is served by bus AP1 <i>from</i> the city <i>to</i> the airport, but not the other way around (unless you go around the entire loop).  There are also free shuttle buses to the Venetian, the Wynn, COD.  A larger permanent ferry terminal is being constructed between the temporary terminal and the Macau International Airport, scheduled for completion in 2011.
Ferries to Macau operate from several points in Hong Kong, including the Hong Kong International Airport where you can bypass Hong Kong Immigration and transfer directly into a ferry to Macau.
The price of ferry tickets differ based on the time and day of the week of the ride. Ferry departures at night (between 6PM and 6AM) and on weekends are more expensive.
Especially at the HK Macau Ferry Terminal, keep an eye out for <b>ticket touts</b>.  Some offices here resell legit bulk tickets at a small discount, but an altogether slimier species sells unused tickets for <b>ferries that are about to leave</b> &#8212; you may catch them if you run, but will be out of luck (and money) if you don't.  Be wary of anyone outside the elevators who enthusiastically bekons you to an agents office - and shows you tickets for future sailings, only for you to end up with tickets for ferries that are departing in the next few minutes. A few touts even <b>pose as "inspectors"</b> and, with practiced sleight of hand, swap your ticket.  Don't let anybody not in uniform take your ticket!
Several ferry companies run to Macau from mainland ports including Jiangmen, Shekou (in Shenzhen) and Fu Yong Ferry Terminal (next to Shenzhen Airport).
A more frequent and cheaper option is to catch a ferry to/from Zhuhai's Jiuzhou Port, which is only a few kilometers from the Macau-Zhuhai border. Take a short taxi ride (Â¥10) or a No. 4 bus from the border crossing to the ferry terminal. The bus ride should be included in your ferry ticket. Ferries from Shenzhen Shekou Port to Zhuhai run every 30 minutes. Â¥90.
There are two vehicular entry points into Macau from China. They are the <b>Portas do Cerco</b> (éé <i>Guan Chap</i> in Cantonese, <i>Guanzha</i> in Mandarin) at the extreme north of Macau Peninsula which connects you to Gongbei in Zhuhai, and the <b>Lotus Bridge</b> (officially the Cotai Frontier Checkpoint) which links the Cotai Strip with the Wanzai district of Zhuhai.
You can only enter if your vehicle (cars only, no motorcycles) has both Macau and mainland China number plates and the driver carries both Macau and China driver's licenses. Note that you have to switch sides of the road; mainland China drives on the right, Macau on the left.
You can take the coach from <a href="/en/Guangzhou" title="Guangzhou">Guangzhou</a>. The trip takes about 3 hours and costs around Â¥80. Buses are available from the Guangzhou airport at regular intervals. The bus takes you within walking distance (200 metres) of Portas do Cerco -the usual entry point into Macau.
There is also a direct coach from Shenzhen airport and also Shenzhen long distance bus station. The trip from Shenzhen is about 3 hours.
There is also a direct coach from Dongguan city (in Guangdong province) to Macau Airport. The trip takes about 3 hours and costs around Â¥100.
You can also get a bus from either place to Gongbei bus station in Zhuhai. That puts you right across the street from the border facilities so you can walk to Macau (see next section). This can save you a bit of money; the bus is about the same price either way, but food and hotels are cheaper in Zhuhai.
<b>Macau International Airport</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.macau-airport.com/en/v01/01_express.php">[14]</a> (MFM) is off the shore of Taipa Island. It has basic facilities and a couple of aerobridges, but it is possible that you will park on the tarmac and take a bus to the terminal.
Macau's home carriers is <b>Air Macau</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://en.airmacau.com.mo">[15]</a>.  While nowhere nearly as well served as Hong Kong, the airport is popular among low-cost airlines thanks to its low landing fees. AirAsia Group flies to Macau from <a href="/en/Kuala_Lumpur" title="Kuala Lumpur">Kuala Lumpur</a> and <a href="/en/Bangkok" title="Bangkok">Bangkok</a>-Don Mueang <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.airasia.com">[16]</a> while Tigerair <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.tigerair.com">[17]</a> serves <a href="/en/Singapore" title="Singapore">Singapore</a>, Cebu Pacific <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.cebupacificair.com">[18]</a> and Philippines Airlines serve <a href="/en/Manila" title="Manila">Manila</a> and <a href="/en/Angeles_City" title="Angeles City" class="mw-redirect">Clark</a>, Thai Smile <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.thaismileair.comâ">[19]</a> serves <a href="/en/Bangkok" title="Bangkok">Bangkok</a> and Jin Air <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.jinair.comâ">[20]</a> serves <a href="/en/Seoul" title="Seoul">Seoul</a>-<a href="/en/Incheon" title="Incheon">Incheon</a> .
Bus <b>AP1</b> plies a route between the airport and the Barrier Gate. Its route passes through several points on Taipa Island, and it stops at the ferry terminal on the peninsula on the way. It costs $4.20 per passenger, $3 per bag.  It has limited provision for baggage, and can be very crowded (you may not even get the first bus to arrive).  Change at the ferry terminal for other destinations, the frequent number 3 bus runs from the ferry terminal and passes the Lisboa, Landmark Hotel, and Holiday Inn, or catch one of the hotel/casino shuttles which go the ferry terminal.  The buses do not give change, but there is a currency exchange just inside the terminal that will change foreign currency into low denomination MOP.
Alternatively, take a metered taxi straight to your destination, but there's a $5 airport surcharge plus $2 for the bridge and $3 per bag.  Fares to the city center are around $40-50, the trip taking 15-20 minutes.
<b>If you are bound for Hong Kong, Zhuhai or Shenzhen</b>, you can use the airport's <b>Express Link</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.macau-airport.com/en/v01/01_express.php">[21]</a> special bus service to connect directly to the ferry or the Zhuhai border without passing through Macau immigration.  However, the bus schedule is limited (11AM-6PM only), which limits the utility somewhat; depending on your flight, if you don't need a visa for Macau, it may well be faster to go through immigration twice.  If you have a same-day ticket, you can also use this service in the return direction to transfer directly to the airport.
Connections to mainland China are no longer limited, with services to many cities (as at 2011). Air Macau flies daily to <a href="/en/Beijing" title="Beijing">Beijing</a>, <a href="/en/Nanjing" title="Nanjing">Nanjing</a>, <a href="/en/Ningbo" title="Ningbo">Ningbo</a> and <a href="/en/Shanghai" title="Shanghai">Shanghai</a>. They also fly several times a week to <a href="/en/Chengdu" title="Chengdu">Chengdu</a>, <a href="/en/Chongqing" title="Chongqing">Chongqing</a>, <a href="/en/Hangzhou" title="Hangzhou">Hangzhou</a>, <a href="/en/Hefei" title="Hefei">Hefei</a>, <a href="/en/Nanning" title="Nanning">Nanning</a>, <a href="/en/Wuhan" title="Wuhan">Wuhan</a> and <a href="/en/Xiamen" title="Xiamen">Xiamen</a>. Xiamen Airlines flies to <a href="/en/Fuzhou" title="Fuzhou">Fuzhou</a>, Hangzhou and Xiamen. Other airlines include AirAsia, Cebu Pacific, EVA Air and Spring Airlines (among others). It is usually cheaper to fly to Zhuhai and cross the border by land as flights between Macau and the mainland are considered to be international flights.
You can cross from mainland China to Macau on foot at the <b>Portas do Cerco</b> (Barrier Gate) crossings at the extreme north of Macau Peninsula. In fact, thousands of Macau and Chinese citizens do it daily, making it an horrendously busy crossing. Depending on the time and day of the week, expect long waits to get processed. The crossing on the Chinese side is called Gongbei. <b>Getting there/away:</b> The massive underground Portas do Cerco bus terminal is beneath the pretty garden in front of the border checkpoint plaza. You'll be able to find buses to most parts of Macau, including Taipa, Coloane and the Cotai Strip from here. From downtown Macau by taxi, the border is about 10 minutes and $30.
As most people crossing the Barrier Gate are either mainland or Macau residents, foreign passport holders may get a short queue at the Zhuhai immigration clearance as they do not pass through the same counters as Chinese nationals. However, Macau's immigration divides entrants only into Macau residents and visitors, without further differentiation, and foreigners have to queue with an overwhelming number of mainland residents.
There are money changers at the Barrier Gate that give very good rates so you can change your money into Chinese renminbi before crossing the customs.
Although you are not allowed to walk on the <b>Lotus Bridge</b> between Wanzai and Cotai, you can board a bus to cross it.
The <b>Sky Shuttle</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.skyshuttlehk.com">[22]</a> helicopter service operates every 15-30 minutes between Macau's Terminal Maritimo and the Hong Kong-Macau Ferry Pier in Hong Kong, as well as five times a day to/from Shenzhen airport.  The trip takes just 16 minutes, but weekday/weekend tickets cost a whopping HK$3700/3900 one-way.
This is arguably the best way to get around the Macau Peninsula, which is small, compact and full of things to discover. Many roads are also one way so there is quite a chance that it won't be slower than to take road transport which may need to make a long loop to reach the destination. Most streets have a pedestrian sidewalk making walking easy, although you will have to fight the crowds going in all directions. Traffic rules are not very well adhered to, so ensure that you look both ways before crossing. In and around the Senado Square, the pavements will be made of hand-laid limestone pieces made into simple designs, something that will surely catch your attention. Macau is also hilly, be prepared to struggle up and down steep lanes and steps.
Especially in the old city, the city streets do not seem to run in any particular pattern and you'll most likely get lost at some stage, which is part of the fun of exploring Macau.
Don't bother trying to get around the Cotai area on foot though, as the huge long streets with nothing much on them except the outside edge of new hotels and giant building sites will eat up time you could better spend elsewhere in Macau.
Macau and its districts are served by three bus companies - Transportes Urbanos Macau (Transmac) <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.transmac.com.mo/">[23]</a> and Sociedade de Transportes Colectivos de Macau (TCM) <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.tcm.com.mo/">[24]</a> and since August 2011, Sociedade de Transportes PÃºblicos Reolian (Reolian) <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.reolian.com.mo">[25]</a>. The bus system in Macau can be difficult to use. It is often difficult to gauge which direction the bus is heading and the routes through the city center are very curvy, making a long ride out of a short distance. Bus drivers usually only speak Cantonese, very little English or Mandarin and certainly no Portuguese at all. Most bus stops contain no English, although you can sometimes figure out the destination from Portuguese words.
Nevertheless, the websites of all three companies have good route guides. The TCM website <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.tcm.com.mo/Route.html">[26]</a> is only in Chinese, while the Transmac website <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.transmac.com.mo/">[27]</a> depicts routes schematically. The Reolian website <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.reolian.com.mo/en/maps-and-schedules">[28]</a> is the best as it has English pages and all Macau bus routes, including those not operated by Reolian, as well as bus stops are clearly shown using Google Maps.
There is a flat fare of $3.20 for rides within the Macau Peninsula, $4.20 between the Peninsular and Taipa, $5 between the Peninsula and Coloane village, and $6.40 between the Peninsula and HÃ¡c SÃ¡ (Coloane). But like the buses in Hong Kong, your fare is according to the bus stop you board, not by the length of the journey. Fare are displayed next to the fare box, so get your destinations written in Chinese if you need to tell them where you're going. You need the exact fare as drivers do not give change. Macaupass, a debit card similar to Hong Kong's Octopus Card system, is now widely used by Macau citizens as it provide discounts on paying bus fare. However, it may be hard to purchase one as the distribution points are limited. Buses accept Hong Kong coins (but not the $10 Hong Kong coin).
Scooters are a wonderful way to see the sites of Macau, they are also the primary mode of transport for locals due to Macau's narrow streets and lack of car parking space. Scooters will seat one or two people and can provide the convenience to see some of the more beautiful and less crowded spots in Macau, such as Coloane Village, Cheoc Van Beach or the Portuguese fort. Macau is very small and it is easy to navigate around, while driving is much less hectic and more civilized than in other places in Asia.
Macau Scooter Hire <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.macauscooters.com">[29]</a> provides scooters for rental, though it is best to make reservations online prior to your arrival. Motorbike rental starts at US$19 for 3 hours or $40 per day (Aug 2013). The longer the hire the cheaper it gets per hour / day. Driving licenses from most countries covering mopeds or motorcycles are accepted.
If you've got more time than money on your hands, you can travel around Macau for free simply by hopping on and off the <b>complimentary shuttle buses</b> operated by all major casinos and hotels. Virtually all serve the Terminal Maritimo, with buses every 5 to 10 minutes, while the big boys (Venetian, Wynn, City of Dreams, Galaxy etc) also shuttle to the Border Gates, the Taipa Ferry Terminal and the airport. The buses to Hotel Lisboa, for example, drop you off just a few blocks from Largo do Senado. You generally have to be at least 18 years old to use them. You may have to get a ticket from Lisboa Casino in order to leave the casino by shuttle but most of the casinos offer totally free to take their shuttle buses.
Starting from September 2008 taxi fares start at $13. Largo do Senado to the border is about 40MOP. The longest possible taxi ride (from the Border Post at the extreme north of Macau to Coloane in the south) would be well under 200MOP.
It is a good idea to have your destination written in Chinese as most taxi drivers are monolingual in Cantonese. Some of them may speak a little Mandarin or English, though it is not wise to count on your luck, and almost none speak Portuguese. Most taxi drivers carry with them a list of casinos and other important places, so in case there's a communication gap, just look for it on the sunguard of the front passenger seat.  Should you leave from a casino/hotel, a bilingual English/Cantonese speaking employee will generally be there to tell the cab driver where you want to go.
Like in Hong Kong, every bag placed in the boot of the taxi will have an additional surcharge.
Many taxi drivers are off duty at Sundays and use their cars privately. Those taxis have a red sign in the front window. Expect some waiting for a free taxi on Sundays.
As in Hong Kong, cycle rickshaws  (<i>triciclo</i> or <i>riquexÃ³</i>) are a dying breed, although a few still lurk around tourist haunts like the ferry terminal and Hotel Lisboa.  Prices are negotiable, but a few hours of city touring by <i>triciclo</i> might cost around $200.
Car rental is not a popular option in Macau given the territory's high population density and small size. Avis <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.avis.com.mo">[30]</a> provides car rental services in Macau and you have the option of renting the car with or without a driver. Roads are generally well maintained and directional signs are in both Chinese and Portuguese. Unlike in mainland China, international driving permits (IDP's) are accepted in Macau, and traffic moves on the <b>left</b> side of the road with most cars being <b>right-hand drive</b> (largely due to influences from neighbouring Hong Kong).
If you wish to drive a mainland China, your vehicle must have a second set of number plates issued by the Guangdong authorities, and you would need to carry an additional Mainland license, as the Chinese government does not recognise Hong Kong, Macau or foreign licenses. You would also need to change sides of the road at the border.
<b>Vong or Wong?</b><br />
One of the oddities of Macau is that some Cantonese names and words that are pronounced with what in English is a "W" sound, and that in Hong Kong are transliterated with a "W", are transliterated with a "V" instead, such as in <i>Cheoc Van</i> (which in Hong Kong would be <i>Chuk Wan</i>). This can also be seen in the surname <i>Vong</i> (in Hong Kong <i>Wong</i>). No doubt Portuguese pronunciation has had an influence on this choice of transliteration. To complicate things further, this has not been done consistently so there are both Vongs and Wongs in Macau - both written with the same Chinese character.
Macau's official languages are <a href="/en/Cantonese_phrasebook" title="Cantonese phrasebook">Cantonese</a> and <a href="/en/Portuguese_phrasebook" title="Portuguese phrasebook">Portuguese</a>.
<b>Cantonese</b> is the most commonly spoken language of Macau (88%, 2001 census). <a href="/en/Chinese_phrasebook" title="Chinese phrasebook">Mandarin</a> is not widely spoken, though most locals are able to comprehend it to some degree. Staff working at major hotels and tourist attractions will usually be reasonably competent in Mandarin.
English is spoken by most front-line staff in the tourism industry. Nearly all museums and casinos have some staff with excellent English, as do many hotels, shops and restaurants, especially the up-market ones. However, English is not as widely spoken as in Hong Kong, so outside the main tourist areas, especially in establishments catering to the average working class, you will find that most people are not conversant in English. This includes most bus and taxi drivers, so be sure to have staff from your hotel write down the names of your destinations in Chinese to show the taxi driver, and get your hotel's business card in case you get lost. If you have to ask someone on the street of directions in English, your best bet is to approach a young adult who is likely to be a college student or having graduated from it (which is not difficult to find given the fact that more and more young people in Macau are now entering universities).
Speakers of <b>Portuguese</b> won't find it very useful when talking to local residents as it is no longer compulsory in schools, but it helps a lot in understanding place names and signs. As Portuguese continues to be an official language of the SAR, government offices are required by law to have Portuguese-speaking staff on duty.
All official signs in Macau are bilingual in traditional Chinese and Portuguese. Note that under the "one country two systems" policy, Macau continues to use traditional Chinese characters and not the simplified Chinese characters used in Mainland China.
Although best known for gambling, Macau is extremely rich in attractions and oozing with atmosphere, thanks to hundreds of years of fusion between European and Chinese cultures.
Macau is a fascinating place to just walk around as the place is packed with churches, temples, fortresses and other old buildings bearing an interesting mix of Portuguese and Chinese characteristics. Besides buildings, there are also hundreds of narrow alleyways forming a maze in the old part of Macau where the people of Macau carry out businesses and work. If the sheer density of humans get to you, take a break and enjoy several pretty gardens or head to the island.
One of the interesting things to see in Macau is a statue of the Bodhisatta Avalokitesvara (known as è§é³ <i>kwoon yam</i> in Cantonese) located next to the sea near the Sands Casino and MGM Grand. Despite being a Chinese deity, the statue is distinctly European in design and resembles the statues of the Virgin Mary you can find in Europe.
And if history is not your thing, there is the <b>Macau Tower</b> of awesome views and adventure sports, or <b>Fisherman's Wharf</b> to enjoy some theme-park activities and shopping.
You'll find most of the attractions in Macau Peninsula, but Taipa and Coloane, each with a pretty village, also draw hordes of visitors. Visit the Cotai reclaimed land area to see its transformation into the "Las Vegas Strip of the East". The Venetian is the most famous with its Venice-styled shopping mall with rivers running through, and is also currently the largest casino in the world.
The City of Dreams is a giant casino with high end fashion shops, a free video 'bubble' show, three hotels and the world's most expensive theatre show. The 'House of Dancing Water' cost US$250 million and the stage holds five olympic swimming pools worth of water. Ushers give the front few rows of the audience towels. Free shuttles from the main ferry terminal leave constantly.
A large section of Macau Peninsula has been designated a Unesco World Heritage site and 25 buildings and sites within the area have been deemed to have cultural and historic significance. 
One of the best ways to cover the sights is to do the Macau Heritage Walk circuit. The heritage Buildings, the Sao Paulo Cathedral, the Fort and the Macau Museum are all adjacent to each other and can be conveniently seen individually even if one cannot catch the Heritage walk timing.

<a href="/en/Macau/Taipa" title="Macau/Taipa">Taipa Village</a> and <a href="/en/Macau/Coloane" title="Macau/Coloane">Coloane Village</a>, previously inhabited by fishermen, are also interesting with their colonial-era shops and houses along narrow lanes.
Macau has several museums. The "Macau Museum Pass", which gives discounted entry to most of these, is currently off the market. The main museums, such as the <b>Macau Museum</b>, are in Macau Peninsula although there are two museums on Taipa - the <b>Museum of Taipa and Coloane History</b> and <b>Taipa Houses Museum</b>.
<b>Gambling</b> is Macau's biggest industry and busloads arrive daily from mainland China to try their luck. In addition, many Hong Kongers arrive on weekends with the same aim. For many years, the Casino Lisboa was the most famous and a landmark well known to people outside Macau, but it is being eclipsed by Sands Casino which opened in 2004.  Nevertheless, the original Casino Lisboa is still worth a visit as its halls contain many original antiques on display from the private collection of gambling tycoon Stanley Ho.
Most casinos are located along the waterfront on the southern side of <b><a href="/en/Macau/Peninsula" title="Macau/Peninsula">Macau Peninsula</a></b>. North of the Lisboa is a strip with many smaller casinos, a number of hotels and bars, and quite a few restaurants. This can be one of the more interesting areas of Macau; among other things it has quite a good Indian restaurant and several Portuguese ones. However, parts of it are also fairly sleazy, with lots of hookers and touts, so some caution is in order. New casinos have also opened in the area called NAPE south of Avenida de Amizade, including Wynn Macau and Sands Macau.
All this is going to be overtaken by the new development on the <b>Cotai Strip</b>, which is being made into "The Las Vegas Strip of the East". The biggest casino in the world, Venetian Macao, opened its doors in August 2007 and the not-much-smaller City of Dreams followed in 2009, with many more still to come.  There are also several casinos on Taipa, including the Crown Macau.
There are ATMs available at either casino as well as Forex facilities to change your money. Gamblers are required to be at least 21 years of age, as of 1st November 2012 to be allowed to play. Interestingly, local civil servants are not allowed to enter the casinos with the exception of the first three days of the Chinese new year.
For the full listing of casinos, see the respective district pages.
Another popular form of gambling in Macau is greyhound racing, where people bet on dogs in the same way that many people in other countries bet on horses. The minimum bet is 10 patacas and payouts can be made in both Macanese Patacas and Hong Kong Dollars.
Canidrome is your spot for great Greyhound racing. It is located on Avenida General Castelo Branco.
Greyhound races are held at Canidrome on Monday, Thursday and Friday plus weekends - racing starts at 7:45PM with 16 games each night.
$10 admission fee (redeemable when betting) to get in. Box seats are $80 for non-peak days and $120 for weekends and holidays. There is off-track-betting available for Canidrome at Jai-Alai Palace, Hotel Lisboa and Kam Pek Casino.
Currently reopened to public. As it has only recently reopened, most taxi will still say that it is closed and refused to drive there.
At a height of 233m, the bungy jump from Macau tower, maintained and operated by A. J. Hackett is the 2nd highest in the world. Along with the bungy, one can also try the Sky jump, that is somewhat like a jump but is more protected and doesn't involve a free fall, and a sky walk, that is a protected on a platform running around the circumference of the floor. Bouldering and sport climbing activities are also conducted at the tower's base. See the <a href="/en/Macau/Peninsula" title="Macau/Peninsula">Macau Peninsula</a> page for details.
Macau's two beaches - <b>Hac Sa</b> (é»æ² - <i>black sand</i>) and <b>Cheoc Van</b> (ç«¹ç£ - <i>bamboo bay</i>) - are located on the southern side of <a href="/en/Macau/Coloane" title="Macau/Coloane">Coloane</a> island. They are very popular and are frequented by locals and visitors, especially at the weekend.
Besides beaches, there are several public swimming pools all over Macau. All high-end hotels also have swimming pools.
There are opportunities for hiking and cycling on the relatively rural islands of <a href="/en/Macau/Taipa" title="Macau/Taipa">Taipa</a> and <a href="/en/Macau/Coloane" title="Macau/Coloane">Coloane</a>.
There is a bowling centre of international standard which was constructed in 2005 for the East Asian Games at the <b>Macau Dome</b> (æ¾³éè) in Cotai area.  There is also a bowling alley in Macau near the Camoes Garden/Protestant cemetery.
The official currency of Macau is the <b>pataca</b> (MOP), which is divided into 100 <b>avos</b>.  <i>Pataca</i> is the traditional <a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Portuguese_language&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Portuguese language (page does not exist)">Portuguese</a> name for the dollar and peso, and the $ sign is used.
The pataca is pegged to the Hong Kong Dollar (HKD) at 1.03 patacas to 1 dollar, and in practice the majority of cash transactions in Macau are made in Hong Kong dollars, which are accepted on an equal 1:1 basis by almost all businesses.
If you pay using Hong Kong dollars, you may receive patacas as change, or a mixture of patacas and dollars. You may find businesses refusing the HK$10 coin, due to the fear of counterfeits.
Although dollars and patacas may be used interchangeably almost everywhere, there are two main exceptions. Transactions made at government offices may only be made in patacas, and most casinos will only accept Hong Kong dollars.
Chinese renminbi (CNY) are also accepted in some businesses, often at a poor exchange rate, but they can easily be changed to patacas at bureaux de change and banks.
Getting money is quite easy as there are banks and ATMs (cash machines) on nearly every street. Holders of a debit card on the international networks will have no issues withdrawing money. Holders of Chinese <b>Union Pay</b> cards will not have trouble either withdrawing local currency from their accounts. ATMs usually dispense in patacas or dollars ($100 and $500 notes) and some will also dispense Chinese renminbi currency.
Changing to or from patacas outside of Macau is almost impossible even in Hong Kong, so any patacas should be spent or changed before leaving the country. The money changers at the Barrier Gate provide good exchange rates, however if you wish to change money before you arrive then change into Hong Kong dollars.
Visa and MasterCard credit cards are widely accepted in major restaurants, stores and the ferry terminal but some merchants may require a token minimum purchase amount, usually $100.
<b>Tipping</b> is generally not practised, though bellhops may expect about $10 or so for carrying your bags. In full service restaurants, a service charge is usually imposed and that is taken to be the tip. However, you should know that the 10% service charge does not go to the actual people who served you, rather it is used by the owners to pay the salaries of said employees. If you wish to give a tip, you should give it in cash directly to the person you wish to reward for their good service. Taxi drivers also do not expect tips, and would return exact change, or round it in your favour if they can't be bothered to dig for change.
Quite frankly, the shopping options in Macau don't hold a candle to Hong Kong. While the newer megacasinos have introduced Macau to the joys of sterile franchise-filled malls, the city center streets around the older casinos are still a bizarre monoculture of ridiculously expensive watch, jewelry and Chinese medicine shops (with an emphasis on herbal Viagra-type cures), all aimed squarely at liberating lucky gamblers from their winnings.  Finding tasteful souvenirs can thus be surprisingly challenging, although the touristy streets between Largo do Senado and the ruins of St. Paul's do have a scattering of antique shops.
Bargaining in the small shops can be done, but usually working on the principle of the shopkeeper quoting a price, the buyer making "hmmm" sounds and the shopkeeper lowering the price a bit. A full-fledged haggling match is quite rare, as most antique shops sell precisely the same thing at precisely the same prices.
Macau is famous for excellent restaurants, unique cuisine and mellow bars. Above all, the city is famous for <b>Macanese</b> and Chinese cuisines: .
Portuguese food (<i>cozinha portuguesa</i>), brought in by its Portuguese colonizers, is hearty, salty, straighforward fare.  While many restaurants claim to serve the stuff, fully authentic fare is mostly limited to a few high-end restaurants, especially the cluster at the southwestern tip of the <a href="/en/Macau/Peninsula" title="Macau/Peninsula">Peninsula</a>.  Typical Portuguese dishes include:
Macanese food (<i>comida de Macau</i>) was created when Portuguese and Chinese influences were mixed together with spices brought from Africa and South-East Asia by traders, and many restaurants advertising "Portuguese" food in fact serve up mostly Macanese dishes.  Seafood and barbecue specialist Fernando's on <a href="/en/Macau/Coloane" title="Macau/Coloane">Coloane</a>'s Hac Sa Beach is probably the best-known Macanese restaurant.
All that said, the food of choice in Macau is still pure <a href="/en/Guangdong" title="Guangdong">Cantonese</a>, and a few aficionados even claim that the <i>dim sum</i> and seafood here beat Hong Kong.  The streets of central Macau are littered with simple eateries offering rice and noodle dishes for under $30 (although menus are often only in Chinese), while every casino hotel worth its salt has a fancy Cantonese seafood restaurant where you can blow away your gambling winnings on abalone and shark's fin soup.
The greatest concentration of restaurants is in the Peninsula, where they are scattered throughout the district. Taipa is now a major destination for those going for Portuguese and Macanese food and there are many famous restaurants on the island. There are several restaurants in Coloane, which is also home to the famous <b>Lord Stow's Bakery</b>, which popularized the Macanese egg tart. Yummy!
Reasonably priced <b>Portuguese wine</b> is widely available.  A glass in a restaurant is around $20, while bottles start from under $100, and a crisp glass of <i>vinho verde</i> ("green wine", but actually just a young white) goes very well with salty Macanese food.  As elsewhere in China, though, locals tend to prefer cognacs and whisky.  <b>Macau Beer</b> is passable and widely available.  There is also a wine museum which you can have the opportunity to taste over 50 varieties of wine.
There is a buzzing nightlife in Macau. There are a variety of bars and clubs along the Avenida Sun Yat Sen close to the Kum Iam Statue and the Cultural Centre where you can have a good night out. Locals, especially among younger people, prefers meet up with their friends in western style cafes or places that serves 'bubble tea'. 'Bubble tea' are usually fruit flavoured tea served with tapioca balls and can be served either hot or cold.  The shops in town centre (near Senado Square) often open until late at night and are often crowded.  The casinos have also become a big hit for entertainment, offering performances of international level (advance booking advised) and comprehensive shopping malls for those less interested in trying their luck with the machines.  For those who want to pamper themselves after a shopping spree, there are Spas available in almost all respectable hotels. Note that these are different to "saunas", which are thinly disguised brothels (prostitution is legal in Macau), but these can be easily distinguishable by their shop appearance.
Macau is very backpacker unfriendly. Due to government regulations there are no hostels in operation and the one YHA requires special permission for lodging. Therefore if you are a backpacker then it is better to stay in Hong Kong and come to Macau for the day, unless you're willing to spend $190 per night for a bed with no facilities.
The bulk of Macau's hotels are on the Peninsula, although there are also many options - including high-end ones - on Taipa and, increasingly, the Cotai Strip, which is challenging the Peninsula to become Macau's premier casino area. Coloane, which offers fewer and much quieter options, has accommodation ranging from the famous Pousada de Coloane to Macau's two beach-side youth hostels.
Hotel rates are most expensive on Friday and Saturday nights, because demand is higher with tourists coming to Macau to gamble over the weekend. Try to make a booking through a travel agent, even if for the same day, as the rates can be substantially lower than walk-in rates. If you are coming from Hong Kong, book through an agent at the Shun Tak ferry pier for the best deals. Getting a package deal including return ferry tickets gives you the best price.
In the Inner Harbour area, many of the pensions and two star hotels are also the place of business for many of the mainland PRC prostitutes that work in Macau, and most hotel "saunas" are in fact thinly disguised brothels.
Hotel listings are in the individual district pages. <b>Budget</b> accommodation is one that carries a <i>2-star</i> rating or below, a <b>mid-range</b> place has a <i>3-star</i> rating, and a <b>splurge</b> place has a <i>4-star</i> rating or above.The cheapest hotels on a weekday are around $190.

Macau has 12 tertiary education institutions. Besides some smaller and more specialized schools (Security Forces School, Tourism School, European Studies Institute, etc), the ones of importance are:
Non-residents who wish to take up employment in Macau, including those from <a href="/en/Portugal" title="Portugal">Portugal</a> or <a href="/en/Mainland_China" title="Mainland China" class="mw-redirect">China</a>, need to obtain a valid work permit and are then issued the so-called <i>Blue Card</i> (officially called <i>Non-Resident Worker's Permit</i>). The process takes approximately a month to receive a work permit, at which time employment may begin, and another 1-2 months to receive the Blue Card.
As illegal employment has over the past decades been a problem plaguing Macau, the authorities do crack down severely on any offenders (both worker and employer) caught. Visitors are therefore advised not to engage in illegal employment.
There is a risk of <b>typhoons</b>, mainly between July and September. A system of typhoon warnings is in place that are issued by the Macao Meteorological and Geophysical Bureau <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.smg.gov.mo/">[36]</a> and are broadcast widely on television and radio:
The typhoon warning system is basically a copy of the system used in <a href="/en/Hong_Kong" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a>.
During a number 8, 9 or 10 typhoon everything in Macau shuts down. People stay home and it is not advisable to venture outside as there is the risk of injury or worse from flying debris.
It should be pointed out that compared to many other cities in the world, Macau is relatively safe to travel. The standard of living of the local Macau residents is generally good (one of the best in Asia). In addition, as a city geared towards tourism, the Macau government is keen to "clean up" the city and its image. For example, the police in Macau is now seen by the public as more effective than it used to be.
The following points should be noted when you travel to Macau.
One unexpected cause of sickness in Macau is the extreme temperature change between 35Â°C (95Â°F) humid summer weather outdoors and 18Â°C (65Â°F) air-conditioned buildings. Some people experience cold symptoms after moving between the two extremes often; it is not unusual to wear a sweater or covering to stay warm indoors, and it is therefore usually good advice to carry a long-sleeve item of clothing when expecting to visit air-conditioned places for extended periods of time.
Whilst tap water is technically safe to drink (taste aside), most locals boil or filter their water or buy inexpensive bottled water which you are also recommended to do so.
Because of the region's history battling SARS (as well as later dealing with avian flu (H5N1)), good personal hygiene is strongly advisable.
There have been some cases of Dengue fever in recent years. The government has pro-actively sprayed insecticide in areas where there is the potential of mosquito breeding, so this risk is largely contained. However it is best to avoid being bitten by using mosquito repellent and/or wearing long clothing, especially at dusk.
People in Macau are general friendly to foreigners (given the fact that Macau had hundreds of years of Portuguese colonial rule, the locals, even the older population are used to living side by side with Westerners). However, do not assume the locals speak English (or Portuguese) and a few essential Cantonese phrases are always helpful.
When visiting Chinese temples basic respect should be shown, but taking photos is usually allowed and you don't need to ask for permission as long as there isn't a no-photography sign posted.
Binge-drinking or drunken behavior is not tolerated in Macau.
Macau's international dialing prefix is <b>853</b>.
The tourist information offices on Largo do Senado and at the jetfoil terminal have maps, information on museums and events, helpful English-speaking staff, and at the Largo do Senado office free Internet access. You may have to queue for the Internet, since there are only a few machines.
Chinoy Express, Rua De Mercadores. A cheap and fast internet cafe ($5/hr) right near Rua De Felicidade.  Serves cheap snacks and right across the road is a Filipino bakery with cheap and tasty breads and very large bottles of San Miguel ($6).
Macau has excellent mobile phone coverage. Macau has both GSM 900/1800 and 3G 2100 networks. Check with your operator. Phone plans stemming from the Mainland require proper set-up for use outside of the Mainland.
Macau has extensive free wifi coverage throughout the city. It is known as the wifigo system. You can also use the encrypted service wifigo-s. The username is "wifigo" and the password is "wifigo"
