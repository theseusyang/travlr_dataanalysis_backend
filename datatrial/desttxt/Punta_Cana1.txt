<b>Taxis:</b> If you are not traveling with a tour operator, a number of taxi drivers are available just outside the Customs area to provide you transportation to the place of your choice.  All taxis operate with standard rates; most drivers carry a copy of these.  The best thing to do when hiring a taxi is to clarify your destination and the price in advance.  You pay upon arrival at your destination.  Most hotels have taxi stations on or near their property; in most cases a bellman or front desk clerk can order a taxi for you.  Taxi drivers accept dollars, pesos and euros.
<b>Local Buses</b>: For the more adventurous, the local bus lines operate on most of the roads of the area, for a minimal cost.  The downside to public transportation in the <a href="/en/Dominican_Republic" title="Dominican Republic">Dominican Republic</a> is irregular bus schedules, crowded vehicles, and potentially unsafe vehicles (689 casualties in 2007), drivers or passengers.  Although for the most part it is a safe and effective means of transportation, it is generally recommended to use one of the more frequented means of getting around.
<b>Rent-a-Car</b>: A number of car rental agencies like Europcar, Budget, Prestige Car Rentals <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.punta-cana.us/Car_Rentals__Rent_a_Car/page_2070443.html">[3]</a> and Avis offer service in the area of Punta Cana and <a href="/en/Bavaro" title="Bavaro">Bavaro</a>.  Many hotels have car rental concessionaries on their properties.  Keep in mind that their driving laws, habits and conditions may be different from the ones you are used to.  When renting a vehicle always take the maximum available insurance, keep a map of the area you intend to drive in, and make sure you are comfortable with the drive.
There is a complete list of some 25 excursions departing from the Punta Cana BÃ¡varo area at <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://puntacanatours.com.do">[4]</a> o <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://bavaroclick.com/joomla/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=126&amp;Itemid=175&amp;lang=en">[5]</a>
The local currency is the Dominican Peso. Its value fluctuates between 30-40 pesos per US dollar and 48-53 pesos per Euro. Although any currency can be changed into pesos, it should be noted that in some situations it may be difficult to exchange pesos back into your original currency.  We recommend exchanging only small amounts of money at a time to avoid any inconveniences.  Most banks exchange Dollars, Euros, and Traveler's cheques and can process cash advances on credit and debit cards.  Don't forget to bring proper identification, such as a driver's license or passport.  Please note that local ATM machines disburse only pesos, contact your bank for related service fees.
If you are planning a day tour to <a href="/en/Santo_Domingo" title="Santo Domingo">Santo Domingo</a>, you will find that everything is much cheaper than you would at the resort. Souvenirs, clothing, artwork, liquor, etc., will be about 1/4 to 1/3 the price at your resort. Also, in the area all shops, restaurants, bars, excursion companies accept US dollars, Euros, Canadian dollars, British pounds, but it is a bit cheaper to pay in Dominican pesos.
Do not exchange money outside a recognized bank or exchange house!
If you walk outside your resort to the city/area internet cafes will also be half the price (yet still pricey by ordinary Dominican standards.  For example, $8 per hour in the resort, $4 per hour in town in Punta Cana or Bavaro. In other parts of the DR, internet cafes are $2 per hour or often less!)
Make sure you spend the remainder of your Dominican pesos. It is next to impossible to convert your pesos back to US dollars or Euros.
There are a variety of shops that are along the beachfront of each resort.  These shops are owned and operated by the locals of the <a href="/en/Dominican_Republic" title="Dominican Republic">Dominican Republic</a>. Shopping outside of the resort complex in Punta Cana/Bavaro can be kind of an adventure. In most shopping plazas, you can expect to be accosted by hoards of Dominicans all pulling you in a differet direction The people of the Dominican Republic love to barter for the price of items. You can expect that once in one of their stores you will definitely be taken for a ride. You will initially be quoted  ridiculously outrageous prices.  It is imperative that you get the item for as cheap as you can. This can become quite an ordeal as the shopkeeper fights with you, insults you for your frugality, etc.  Often times, the locals will offer you a price for an item that is much more expensive the actual value of the product.
When walking along the beach also realize that the people at the shops will bother you to come buy something from them. It can often times become annoying because they will keep pestering you until you come and look at what they have to offer.  Realize though that all you need to do is tell them that you are not interested and keep walking. The best way of letting the locals know that you are not interested is to tell them that you have no money and they will leave you alone. The people of the Dominican Republic are very friendly and become offended when you walk right past them without at least acknowledging their presence. A simple "no thank you" may sometimes work, but in most cases, they will not take no for an answer and will continue to chase and harass you.
Do not buy dried animals (turtle shells, sea shells...etc) because A.) It is illegal, so you will not be allowed to bring them through customs, and may get arrested trying; and B.) It encourages the locals to kill these creatures.  Reef life should stay in the sea, so help to preserve these endangered animals by buying other types of souvenirs.
The all-inclusive resorts offer all kinds of great food. Make sure that you speak with your representative to book your preferred restaurant for dinner in advance. Many all-inclusive resorts have various types of restaurants.  Make sure you take advantage of all their cuisines by reserving a date and time.
Keep in mind that the standards even at the five-star resorts are not the same standards as North America or Europe. Try to eat peeled fruits and vegetables. Stay away from food that may have been sitting for a long time.

Highly recommended rums include Burmudez "Don Armando" and "Anniversario 1852" as well as Macorix "Eight Year".
Though in most Latin and Central American countries coffee is produced primarily for export, most of the coffee grown in the Dominican Republic is savored within its borders.  And Dominicans, like Europeans, enjoy their coffee strong and black. One useful phrase for tourists to learn when ordering coffee is "sin azucar" (no sugar) for the simple reason that the locals measure by tablespoon rather than teaspoon.
The resorts are low-rise and beautiful.  The grounds are lush and tropical with foliage, lagoons and palm trees along with peacocks, flamingos, ducks, parrots and other wildlife that stroll the resortsâ grounds.
