<b>Edinburgh</b> (Gaelic: <i>DÃ¹n Ãˆideann</i>; <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.edinburgh.org/">[1]</a>) is the capital of <a href="/en/Scotland" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> located in the <a href="/en/Central_Belt_of_Scotland" title="Central Belt of Scotland" class="mw-redirect">Central Belt</a> region of the country. With a population of approximately 450,000 (1 million in the city region), "Auld Reekie" (Edinburgh) manages to combine both ancient and modern in a uniquely Scottish atmosphere. Watched over by the imposing castle, the symbol of the city, Edinburgh combines medieval relics, Georgian grandeur and a powerful layer of modern life with contemporary avant-garde. In Edinburgh, medieval palaces rub shoulders with the best of modern architecture, Gothic churches with amazing museums and galleries. Scotland's throbbing night-life centre, Edinburgh, "the Athens of the North", is also a feast for the mind and the senses, playing host to great restaurants, shops and an unequaled programme of city festivals throughout the year. <b>Hogmanay</b>, the Scottish New Year, kicks off the festivities, which culminate in the high summer with the Tattoo, the International and the Fringe, amongst many others.
The <b>Old and New Towns of Edinburgh</b> were listed as <a href="/en/UNESCO_World_Heritage_List" title="UNESCO World Heritage List">World Heritage Sites</a> by UNESCO in 1995. In 2004, Edinburgh became the first member of the <a href="/en/UNESCO_Creative_Cities" title="UNESCO Creative Cities">UNESCO Creative Cities</a> initiative when it was designated a <b>City of Literature</b>.
In a 2009 poll by YouGov, Edinburgh was voted the <b>most desirable city to live in the UK</b>.
Edinburgh is on the east coast of Scotland's central Lowlands, situated on the southern shore of the Firth of Forth. Edinburgh's landscape is the product of ancient volcanism (both the Castle crag and Arthur's Seat are the eroded plugs of volcanoes) and more recent glaciation (carving out valleys south of the castle and the old Nor'Loch, presently the site of the Princes Street Gardens). Impress the locals by knowing that Princes Street is the <b>correct</b> spelling (dedicated plurally and not possessively for King George III's sons - hence the absence of an apostrophe). Don't make the mistake of pronouncing it Princess Street. And watch out for these two commonly mis-pronounced streets as well: Cockburn (coe-burn) and Buccleuch (buh-clue) are nearly always gotten wrong, to the amusement of the locals.
Edinburgh's historic centre is bisected by Princes Street Gardens, a broad swathe of parkland in the heart of the city. Southwards of the gardens is the castle, perched on top of an extinct volcanic crag, and flanked by the medieval streets of the <a href="/en/Edinburgh/Old_Town" title="Edinburgh/Old Town">Old Town</a> following the Royal Mile along the ridge to the east. To the north of Princes Street Gardens lies Princes Street itself - Edinburgh's main shopping boulevard - and the Georgian period <a href="/en/Edinburgh/New_Town" title="Edinburgh/New Town">New Town</a>, built after 1766 on a regular grid plan.
Edinburgh has been the royal capital of Scotland since 1437.
Edinburgh is noted as a long-lived literary capital of the English-speaking world.
The great Scottish historical novelist Sir Walter Scott was born in the city and has his great monument on Princes Street. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was also a native of Edinburgh.
More recently, Edinburgh has variously been the home and inspiration for such well-known modern writers as Muriel Spark (author of <i>The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie</i>), Irvine Welsh (author of the 1993 novel <i>Trainspotting</i>, set in the gritty district of Leith), Ian Rankin (a crime writer best known for the <i>Inspector Rebus</i> series, set in Edinburgh), Alexander McCall Smith (<i>The No. 1 Lady Detective's Agency</i> and several novels set in the Scottish capital) and J.K. Rowling of <i>Harry Potter</i> fame.
Edinburgh's climate is most comfortable for the traveler from May to September. That said, the weather in Edinburgh is always changeable and visitors should expect both sunshine and rain, whatever the season. Edinburgh tends to get windy while it rains as well, so be sure to pack either a raincoat or a sturdy umbrella! Many a tourist has abandoned an inverted umbrella due to the persistent, whipping winds. Summer, the main festival season, combines long daylight hours with lengthy evenings (being so far north, it rarely gets dark before 10 or 11 at night!). Winter can feel bitterly cold, with short daylight hours, however snow is rare and of a short duration, and most of Edinburgh's winter precipitation comes in the form of a chilly rain and sleet. Edinburgh has an abundance of indoor attractions and activities that make the cold winter days fly by. In other words, bring a coat big lad, will ya?
Do not worry about being cold in winter, because like many modern countries all buildings including the old ones are warm, dry and insulated.
Travellers should note that Edinburgh becomes overwhelmingly crowded (accommodation-wise) during the main festival periods of high summer (August to early September) and Hogmanay (around New Year's Day / 1 January). Visitors at these times should plan <i>well ahead</i> (even more than a year in advance!) for booking central accommodation and event tickets at these times.
<b>Edinburgh International Airport</b> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IATA" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:IATA">IATA</a>: <b>EDI</b>) (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICAO" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:ICAO">ICAO</a>: <b>EGPH</b>) <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.baa.com/main/airports/edinburgh/">[2]</a>, the busiest airport in Scotland, is situated some 10 miles west of the city. The airport offers a wide range of domestic and international flights to <a href="/en/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a> and <a href="/en/North_America" title="North America">North America</a>. Many visitors to the city arrive via a connecting flight from <a href="/en/London" title="London">London</a>.  Edinburgh Airport does, however, have a direct flight to and from Newark (UNITED, Twice daily May-October, Daily November-May), a 25 minute train ride or drive from New York City. Since July 2013 Edinburgh also has direct flights, operating during the summer months, to <a href="/en/Toronto" title="Toronto">Toronto</a>. In comparison to most Scottish airports,  Edinburgh's European flight network is well developed, with frequent scheduled flights to destinations such as <a href="/en/Amsterdam" title="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a>, <a href="/en/Athens" title="Athens">Athens</a>, <a href="/en/Barcelona" title="Barcelona">Barcelona</a>, <a href="/en/Berlin" title="Berlin">Berlin</a>, <a href="/en/Brussels" title="Brussels">Brussels</a>, <a href="/en/Budapest" title="Budapest">Budapest</a>, <a href="/en/Copenhagen" title="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a>, <a href="/en/Dublin" title="Dublin">Dublin</a>, <a href="/en/Frankfurt" title="Frankfurt">Frankfurt</a>, <a href="/en/Geneva" title="Geneva">Geneva</a>, <a href="/en/Hamburg" title="Hamburg">Hamburg</a>, <a href="/en/Istanbul" title="Istanbul">Istanbul</a>, <a href="/en/Krakow" title="Krakow" class="mw-redirect">Krakow</a>, <a href="/en/Madrid" title="Madrid">Madrid</a>, <a href="/en/Milan" title="Milan">Milan</a>, <a href="/en/Munich" title="Munich">Munich</a>, <a href="/en/Oslo" title="Oslo">Oslo</a>, <a href="/en/Paris" title="Paris">Paris</a>, <a href="/en/Prague" title="Prague">Prague</a>, <a href="/en/Rome" title="Rome">Rome</a>, <a href="/en/Stockholm" title="Stockholm">Stockholm</a> and <a href="/en/Zurich" title="Zurich">Zurich</a>. For a full list of destinations served to/from Edinburgh Airport see <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.edinburghairport.com/flight-information/destinations-and-airlines">[3]</a>.
A dedicated airport bus service, <b>Airlink Express</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.flybybus.com/">[4]</a>, service 100, runs from outside the terminal building to Edinburgh city centre (Waverley Bridge) at least every 10 minutes until 00.22, and then every 30 minutes from then until 04.45. The bus leaves from Waverley Bridge (opposite entrance to train station) for the Airport at the same intervals 24/7. Adult fares are Â£3.50 for a single, Â£6 for an open return and the journey takes an average 25 mins. The buses offer free wi-fi connection, sockets for charging electrical equipment, CCTV allowing top-deck passengers to monitor their luggage, and electronic "next-stop" information. The Airlink buses have a dedicated blue livery which makes them easy to distinguish from the rest of the Lothian fleet. From 00.22 to 04.45, Airlink passengers must use the <b>N22</b> nightbus to reach the airport, this leaves from Princes Street. The buses on the N22 service are normal Lothian Buses branded vehicles.
A cheaper alternative is the ordinary Lothian Buses service 35 <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://lothianbuses.com/find-your-bus/timetables/819-service-35.html">[5]</a>, which runs from the bus stance outside the arrivals building to Ocean Terminal via the Royal Mile/High Street. Although much slower (about 1h30) and with less provision for baggage than the 100, it is far cheaper at Â£1.40 a single and also allows the use of day tickets (Â£3.50) and other options that work on all Lothian Buses services, a great option for getting straight to the city if travelling lightly or on a budget. Do note that you must carry exact change with you onto the 35, as the driver can't give any back to you, so try and get this from within the airport, or just take the airlink!
<i>Wikitravel has a guide to <a href="/en/Rail_travel_in_the_United_Kingdom" title="Rail travel in the United Kingdom">Rail travel in the United Kingdom</a></i>
The main railway station in Edinburgh is called <b>Waverley Railway Station</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.networkrail.co.uk/aspx/807.aspx">[6]</a> and is an attraction in itself. First opened in 1846, Waverley Station was rebuilt 1892-1902. It lies between the <a href="/en/Edinburgh/Old_Town" title="Edinburgh/Old Town">Old</a> and <a href="/en/Edinburgh/New_Town" title="Edinburgh/New Town">New</a> Towns, adjacent to Princes Street, Edinburgh Castle and the Princes Street Gardens, where it serves over 14 million people per annum. Despite various refurbishments, the past still survives in the station's elaborate, domed ceiling where wreathed cherubs leap amid a wealth of scrolled ironwork.
Waverley Station is a major hub for the Scottish rail network, operated by First Scotrail <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.firstscotrail.co.uk/">[7]</a>. There is an hourly service to <a href="/en/Dundee" title="Dundee">Dundee</a> and <a href="/en/Aberdeen" title="Aberdeen">Aberdeen</a>, and two hourly to <a href="/en/Inverness" title="Inverness">Inverness</a>. Shuttle trains to <a href="/en/Glasgow" title="Glasgow">Glasgow</a> (Queen Street) run every 15 minutes throughout the day, dropping to 30 minutes on evenings and Sundays, and the journey takes 45-50 minutes. There are also services which operate via Bathgate and Airdrie to Glasgow Queen Street Low Level at a 15 minute interval. Stopping patterns differ on this route, meaning that every half hour, the service takes approx. 1 hour whereas every other half hour services take around 1 hour 15 minutes to complete the journey. Some services run to Glasgow Central instead, but run via Lanarkshire with many more stops.  Certain CrossCountry trains originating from Birmingham and the south west also continue to Glasgow Central - again your ticket will be valid on these services but the journey will take slightly longer than the shuttle.
The vast majority of train services to Edinburgh from London (and most of eastern England) are operated by East Coast (which replaced National Express on 14 November 2009) <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.eastcoast.co.uk/">[8]</a>; an hourly service leaves from London Kings Cross station throughout the day until 6PM. Journey time is between 4hrs 20min and 5 hours.  The cheapest tickets (Â£16 to Â£90) are advance single (one-way) fares for a fixed train time bought 2-12 weeks in advance, and the flexible Saver Ticket (roughly Â£100 single or return) is not valid at some times to/from London.  Virgin Trains <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.virgintrains.co.uk">[9]</a> operate a 2 hourly service from Birmingham New Street via the West Coast Mainline with an average journey time of 4hrs 4 mins.
For a different travel experience from London, try the Caledonian Sleeper service <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.firstgroup.com/scotrail/content/caledoniansleeper/">[10]</a>, which runs every night from London's Euston Station except Saturdays, and the journey takes approximately 8 hours. Bear in mind that if you are travelling alone you may have to share the sleeping compartment with a stranger of the same sex. Tickets can be booked in the usual manner at any main line railway station in Britain, and the cost of a return journey to Edinburgh from London varies from around Â£100 for two one-way "Advance" tickets rising to the full open return fare of Â£165. You can also travel for around Â£23 one-way in a seated carriage or Â£95 return (full fare). BritRail passes can be used to reserve tickets on the sleeper trains.
However, heavily discounted one-way tickets on the Caledonian Sleeper known as "Bargain Berths" are available for Â£19, Â£29, Â£39 or Â£49 depending on how early you book, but, confusingly, these cannot be bought from a railway station in the normal way but only from the First ScotRail website, and you will be emailed an e-ticket (similar to an airline), which you must print out and show to the conductor at the platform before getting on the train.
Trains to other English cities are operated by Arriva Cross Country (services via York, Birmingham and central England to the south coast and West Country) and Trans-Pennine Express (services to Manchester via Carlisle) from Waverley.
The "charged by the piece" left luggage service at Waverley railway station is much more expensive (Â£7 per item for 0-24 hours!) than the lockers a few blocks away at the Edinburgh bus station on St. Andrew's Square.
There is a second railway station in the centre of Edinburgh, Haymarket,  around a mile to the west of Waverley. If you are arriving from the north, west or southwest, Haymarket is a better station to exit at if you are heading straight for the airport, zoo, or modern art gallery or if your accommodation is on the west side of town as you will avoid the city centre traffic, and it is on the major westbound bus routes.
Both Waverley and Haymarket stations had ticket barriers installed in 2004 so you will need to purchase a ticket in order to enter or leave the platform area. If you get on a train at an unmanned station, you can purchase a ticket from the conductor on the train or a ticket inspector near the barrier gates: note that there is usually a long queue during the peak rush hour period. The barrier gates will retain single journey tickets so be sure to get a receipt if you need one. If you have the larger kind of ticket that does not fit in the barrier, you will need to go to the gate manned by a member of staff who will check your ticket and let you through. If you do not have a ticket, you will need to go to the ticket office behind the barrier (platform 14 at Waverley) to buy one.
Edinburgh Park is a new train station that opened in 2004, which is some way from the city centre, serves business parks and "The Gyle" shopping centre. As of December 2010, direct trains to and from Glasgow Queen Street Low Level began to serve Edinburgh Park, on the Airdrie-Bathgate route (or A2B) operating on a 15 minute interval. There services will take around an hour to get to Glasgow from Edinburgh Park.
By road, Edinburgh can be reached most immediately by the M8 motorway (from Glasgow and the west), M9 (from <a href="/en/Stirling" title="Stirling">Stirling</a> and the north-west), A90/M90 (from <a href="/en/Perth_(Scotland)" title="Perth (Scotland)">Perth</a>, <a href="/en/Dundee" title="Dundee">Dundee</a> and northern Scotland), the A1 (from <a href="/en/Newcastle_upon_Tyne" title="Newcastle upon Tyne">Newcastle upon Tyne</a> and north-east England) and A702/M74 (from <a href="/en/Carlisle" title="Carlisle">Carlisle</a> and north-western England).
From <a href="/en/London" title="London">London</a> the fastest route to Edinburgh is the M1 motorway, followed by the A1(M) and the A1 - a journey of 640 km (398 mi) and approximately 8-9 hrs driving time.
Edinburgh is not a particularly car friendly city (the worst city to drive in outside of London in the UK) with the myriad of one-way streets and the Old Town's medieval layout, and the dedication of parking wardens to ticketing anything that is not moving is legendary. In addition, the works to install the new tram line will be ongoing until 2014, and have caused numerous road closures and diversions throughout the City Centre and Leith. Finding parking can be difficult, though there are several multi-storey car parks in the city centre (Castle Terrace for the West End, try St James Centre or Greenside at the East End). It is often cheaper and quicker to use the new Park and Ride systems now in place on all approaches to the City, (National Park and Ride Directory is available online <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.parkandride.net/edinburgh/edinburgh_frameset.shtml">[11]</a>), so it's even easy to just abandon your car on the outskirts. For visitors arriving from the M8, follow directions for Edinburgh Airport to reach Ingliston Park and Ride; this facility is half a mile from the airport terminal.
The city is served by the major inter-city bus companies from around Scotland and England. Most long distance services start and end in the Bus Station in St Andrew Square. The left luggage lockers at the Bus station are much cheaper than the "charged by the piece" left luggage service at Waverly train station.
Edinburgh is a compact city - most of the sights and major tourist attractions are within the <b>Old Town</b> and <b>New Town</b> and are no further than a 15 minute walk apart. Walking along elegant or atmospheric streets is one of the pleasures of the city. There are however, a number of hills to be navigated; for example from Princes Street, up <b>The Mound</b> towards <b>Edinburgh Castle</b> requires some significant legwork, but it's worth it for the views en route.
The city's public transport system is relatively poor next to London and other major European cities - being heavily reliant on buses, which have to navigate the city's sometimes bustling traffic.  Congestion charging similar to that found in the English capital has been proposed but was defeated at a referendum. Equally, the suburban railway network is very sparse compared to that of Glasgow, although there have been some slow and steady improvements over the years with work begun on a tram system linking the city centre to Leith and to the airport.
Edinburgh has two main bus companies, <b>Lothian</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.lothianbuses.co.uk/">[13]</a>, which is majority-owned by the Edinburgh City Council, and <b>First</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.firstgroup.com/ukbus/scotland/sescot/home/">[14]</a>, a private operator. These two companies share the same bus stops, but the route numbers and tickets are not interchangeable and they operate different fare structures.
<b>Lothian</b> are the larger operator in the city itself whose distinctive madder-red (burgundy) and cream coloured buses had become as much a symbol of Edinburgh as its buildings. For some reason Lothian saw this as a negative and this livery was almost completely phased out in favour of Harlequin colours, which are predominantly white, with red and gold rhombuses of different sizes along the sides. Some of the more important routes also have different colours on the front and roof of the bus to help passengers spot their required bus. As of March 2010, they have started to repaint the fleet into the traditional "madder" livery. By 2012, the Harlequin livery will have been consigned to the history books, but in the short term travellers should be aware that both colour schemes will be in operation.
Single tickets for Lothian Buses are Â£1.50 (70p for under 16s) and are valid for <i>only one journey</i>. If you have to change bus, you have to buy another Â£1.50 ticket! Bear in mind that bus drivers will not give change, so save up those Â£1.00 and 20p coins.
More conveniently, Lothian offer an all-day ticket for Â£3.50 (as of March 2012) that covers all transport (except sightseeing, airport express and night services). The all-day ticket is a great way to see the city without the expense of the tour buses, as you can get on and off all Lothian buses for the whole day. Kids' day tickets are generously discounted to Â£2. You can buy these from any bus driver, or from Lothian Buses offices.
Lothian are in the process of rolling out their <b>BusTracker</b><a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.mybustracker.co.uk/">[15]</a> service. This provides "real time" bus service information. Electronic signs are being installed along major routes, showing the wait time for the next bus on each service at that stop. Online, it's possible to view the information for every bus stop in the city, not just those stops with electronic signs. Every stop has a unique eight-figure code, which are listed on the website and also displayed at the stop. You can access Bus Tracker via a mobile phone at mobile.mybustracker.co.uk. A free apps named "Edinbus" for iPhone and "My Bus Edinburgh" for Android provide similar information with route maps and a stop locator.
<b>First</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.firstgroup.com/ukbus/scotland/sescot/home/">[16]</a> buses mostly service farther-flung areas to the east and west of the city.
<b>Edinburgh Coach Lines</b> operate service 13 <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.service13.co.uk/">[17]</a>, a bus of use to many visitors as it is the only route serving the National Gallery of Modern Art and the Dean Gallery. Single tickets are in line with Lothian fares at Â£1.20 for adults and 70p for children (under 16). Lothian season tickets and day tickets are not valid on service 13.
There are also four companies that operate sightseeing buses <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.edinburghtour.com/">[18]</a>, all of which are now owned by Lothian Buses. All have a policy that a sightseeing ticket is valid for 24 hours, so you can get around central Edinburgh quite handily using the sightseeing buses. Each sightseeing bus follows a different route around the city, but they all start and finish at Waverley Bridge, adjacent to Waverley Station on Princes Street.
A small number of suburban rail routes run from Waverley station, most of the stations lying in the south west and south east suburbs of the city, and are useful for reaching the outer suburbs and towns of Balerno, Currie, Wester Hailes, Wallyford, Prestonpans, Musselburgh, South Queensferry, Newcraighall and a useful link to Edinburgh Park which is adjacent to the Gyle shopping complex.  Services to North Berwick, Bathgate, Fife or Glasgow Central will make stops at these various stations.  Note that standard National Rail fares apply to these trains - there are no credible daily season ticket options available.  Check at the station before you board!
The "charged by the piece" left luggage service at Waverly train station is far more expensive than the storage lockers a few blocks away at the Bus station on St Andrew's square.
Central Edinburgh is a nightmare to drive in, particularly the Old Town with its tangle of medieval streets with their associated one way systems.  The New Town fares slightly better, but the scourge "Blue Meanies" who mercilessly swoop on vehicles which may have only been illegally parked for a matter of minutes. Edinburgh operates a "controlled parking zone" - on-street parking is illegal within a large central area (see map <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.edinburgh.gov.uk/internet/Transport/Parking/Parking_permits/CEC_controlled_parking_zone__cpz__map">[19]</a>)  without a residents parking permit. Parking fines are Â£40 and vehicles parked in an obstructive manner are liable to be towed away with a Â£150 release fee to be paid for its retrieval. Even the suburbs (especially Morningside, The Grange, The Meadows) have little parking available (and on-street parking is illegal within the controlled parking zone). Take a bus and/or walk.  Leith seems to fare a bit better for parking, but there's no guarantee. Park and Ride facilities provide access to the city centre <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.parkandride.net/edinburgh/edinburgh_frameset.shtml">[20]</a>. Additionally, until (at least) 2012 drivers should take heed of tram construction taking place at various loctions throughout the city centre, Leith, and the west of the city.
Edinburgh is a beautiful city that's full of history.  There is no better way to see it than to walk.
There is a single tram line currently being built in Edinburgh that will link St Andrew's Square in the centre of Edinburgh to Edinburgh Airport on the west, passing through the New Town to the city centre. However, disputes with the main construction contractor and delays in construction mean that the project is now scheduled for completion in 2014. As it will link the airport, rugby stadium, both main train stations and Princes Street it may be helpful for some visitors to the city. However buses are likely to remain the main and most practical method of public transport in Edinburgh for the foreseeable future. If stuck for a topic of conversation with a local, be assured that almost anyone will have an opinion on the trams.
Like most major British cities, Edinburgh offers a choice between <i>Black Cabs</i>, carrying up to 5 passengers, which can be hailed on the street, and <i>minicabs</i>, which must be pre-booked. Black cabs display an orange light above the windscreen to indicate that they are available to hire. It's usually quite easy to find a cab in and around the city centre, and on the main radial routes running out of the centre. There are also Taxi Ranks dotted around the city, where black cabs will line up to be hired. Taxi Rank locations include:
The main taxi firms operating within the city are:
For the budget-conscious and/or avid sightseer, the  <b>Edinburgh Pass</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.edinburgh.org/pass/">[22]</a> is well worth bearing in mind, offering a maximum of Â£155 worth of entry to 27 of Edinburgh's top attractions, a 90-page guidebook, retail and restaurant offers and discounts. All this, as well as free public transport around the city and airport transfers. A one-day pass costs Â£29, two days Â£39, three days Â£49 (2011 prices). Can be purchased online or at Tourist Information Centres.
If you are staying in Scotland a little while, it might be worth getting a <b>Historic Scotland Membership</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/">[23]</a>. Passes last for a year, and cost about Â£40 for adults and Â£30 for concessions (including full-time students). They provide unlimited access to about 70 paying sites in Scotland, including Edinburgh's Castle and Craigmillar Castle. You also get a lot of discounts for their shops, a quarterly magazine, and 50% off all English, Welsh and Manx historical sites.

Edinburgh in the summer becomes "festival city" when a huge number of major national and international arts festivals are hosted by the city. Most of these occur virtually simultaneously in August. These cater for a wide variety of interests and include:
One important thing to decide when planning a trip to Edinburgh is whether you wish to go at festival time, which runs from early August through to mid-September. Hotel rooms in and around the city are noticeably much more expensive then, and you will need to book well (<i>at least</i> six months!) in advance.
Edinburgh in the winter festive season is also huge with various concerts and other activities taking place starting a couple of weeks before Christmas and running up to a week into January. Princes Street Gardens play host to a Big Wheel, outdoor ice rink and various festive markets. As in most of the rest of Scotland, <b>Hogmanay</b>, the New Year celebrations, are the main focus of the festive season rather than Christmas. On the night itself whole sections of central Edinburgh are roped off and accessible only by ticket for the Hogmanay street party <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.edinburghshogmanay.org/">[54]</a>, which takes place across several stages and is easily the largest in Scotland. Hogmany and Edinburgh fit together like hand and glove.
Edinburgh is host to a number of higher and further education organisations including 4 Universities. The following offer summer schools of a week or more on topics such as creative writing or printmaking:
<b>Colleges</b>
<b>Private schools:</b>
Edinburgh is a popular destination for language students, looking to learn English, or build on their existing English language skills. Most schools offer a "homestay" option where accommodation is with a local family, which can be a great introduction to Scottish life. Language schools in the city include:

Edinburgh is a great city for the food lover. There is a vast selection of eateries scattered throughout every part of the city, catering for all tastes, prices and styles - from fast-food to Michelin-starred grandeur. Just be careful around the castle and in the Grassmarket area, where many restaurants are tourist traps. 
Refer to the <a href="/en/Edinburgh#Districts" title="Edinburgh">District</a> articles for individual listings.
As well as the centre of Edinburgh,  it is also worth checking out Leith and the West End when looking for a place to eat.
Rose St, running parallel to Princes St is a pedestrian precinct that has a huge number of pubs offering a variety of pub fare food.
The Scots are well known for having a penchant for fried food which has resulted in such gastronomic delights as deep fried pizza, deep fried hamburgers, deep fried Black Pudding (a type of blood sausage), deep fried haggis and deep fried Mars bars. If you're up to it, be sure to drop by a <i>chippy</i> (fish and chip shop) and experience these Scottish delights.  Edinburgh chippys are unique in the UK for offering <i>salt'n'sauce</i> as standard in place of the <i>salt'n'vinegar</i> usually provided elsewhere in the country. The sauce is a kind of runny, vinegary version of <i>HP</i> or <i>Daddys</i> style brown sauce. Most chippys will provide vinegar on request if you prefer, but you really should try salt'n'sauce at least once!
There are establishments to suit all tastes scattered throughout every pocket of the city. Be careful, some of the more <i>local</i> pubs can be a little rough around the edges, especially in Leith.
For a non-alcoholic beverage give Scotland's second national drink a try - <b>Irn-Bru</b> . It's a great cure for hangover.
Edinburgh is a <a href="/en/Wikitravel:Huge_city_article_template" title="Wikitravel:Huge city article template">huge city</a>, so all individual listings should be moved to the appropriate <b><a href="#Districts">district articles</a></b>, and this section should contain a brief overview.

As for Scotland's first drink, you will find <b>The Scotch Whisky Heritage Centre</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.scotchwhiskyexperience.co.uk/">[65]</a> at the top of The Royal Mile, which offers an interactive "tour" of the history and practise of Whisky distilling, complete with a rather sedate barrel ride.  This is a good place to go if you want to sample whisky, as they have a very large selection (200+?) at a fairly reasonable price.  Older whiskys tend to cost more and the rarest on offer can cost up to Â£50.00 per measure!  The atmosphere is less pub-like than some might like as it tends to be fairly quiet - if you don't fancy the interactive tour and just want to try some whiskys then check the listings for some good whisky pubs but in any event, the majority of Edinburgh pubs tend to have a reasonable array of Scotch whiskys on offer.  The food at the Centre is reasonably priced and fairly good.
See the <a href="/en/Edinburgh#Districts" title="Edinburgh">district</a> articles for individual listings.
Edinburgh has been established as a tourist destination for centuries, and so there is a huge choice of accommodation available for travellers. If you're planning a visit during festival time (Aug), around Christmas and New Year, or on the weekend of a Scotland home game in the 6-nations Rugby <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.rbs6nations.com/">[67]</a> (Mar/Apr, 2 or 3 matches per year), then you will find that all types of accommodation get booked up well in advance, and a premium may be applied to the room-rate. It's not impossible to get somewhere to stay at short notice at these times, but you won't be able to be fussy and it will probably be expensive.  Note however that the average cost of hotel accommodation in Edinburgh is higher than anywhere else in Scotland.
For those on a budget, there are cheap youth hostels available with prices from Â£10 and above. The private/independent hostels centre around the Cowgate area, the lower Royal Mile and its side streets. The hostels of the HI affiliated Scottish Youth Hostel Association <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.syha.org.uk">[68]</a> can be booked on-line and are an especially good deal during summer, when the SYHA rents student accommodation as summer hostels: Single rooms in the city centre for a very modest price.
There are Guest Houses and small hotels dotted around almost every part of the city, however there are high concentrations in 2 areas, namely around Newington Road and Minto Street on the <a href="/en/Edinburgh/South" title="Edinburgh/South">South</a> side, and on Pilrig Street and Newhaven Road in <a href="/en/Edinburgh/Leith" title="Edinburgh/Leith">Leith</a>. Both areas are within a brisk 15-20 minute walk of the city centre and both have excellent round-the-clock bus services. If arriving in town without having booked accommodation, it may be worth heading for one or other of these areas and looking out for the "Vacancies" signs, though probably not during the festival or around Hogmanay.
Some of the Guest Houses and even hotels can be booked for as little as the hostels at certain times of year, while more upmarket accommodation ranges from boutique B&amp;B's, with just a few rooms, lovingly run by a family, to world-renowned large 5-star hotels.
Another good alternative for accommodation is self-catering holiday apartments. Edinburgh has a wide offer of short term holiday apartments steps away from its main tourist attractions. It is a great opportunity to experience the city as a local. Apartments can be booked on-line. For summer months, especially August, it is highly recommended to book well in advance as most tourists tend to make their bookings in February for this period.
Due to the excellent and frequent rail links between the two cities, savvy travellers can cut the costs by basing themselves in <a href="/en/Glasgow" title="Glasgow">Glasgow</a>, where deals in mainstream chain hotels are easier to come by - and you get the advantage of being able to "do" both cities - bear in mind of course when your last train leaves!
Multiple internet cafÃ©s and hotspot venues exist throughout Edinburgh (see <a href="/en/Edinburgh#Districts" title="Edinburgh">district</a> articles for details).
In general Edinburgh can be considered a <a href="/en/Staying_safe" title="Staying safe" class="mw-redirect">safe</a> destination for visitors, but like all other major cities, it pays to remain attentive and use some common sense.
In emergency, dial 999 (preferably from a landline, a free call from any phone including payphones), 112 also works. For advice on non-emergency medical problems, you can ring the 24-hour NHS 24 service on 0845 424 2424.
The <b>Western General</b> near Crewe Toll runs a no-appointment Minor Injuries Clinic between 8am and 9pm every day. <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.nhslothian.scot.nhs.uk/Services/Emergencies/MinorInjuryClinic/Pages/default.aspx">http://www.nhslothian.scot.nhs.uk/Services/Emergencies/MinorInjuryClinic/Pages/default.aspx</a>
During normal shopping hours (M-F 9AM-5:30PM, Sa 9AM-12:30PM), you won't have any problem locating a pharmacy as they are dotted all around the city. Any row of local shops will usually include one. Common brands include <i>Boots</i> (city centre branches in the <a href="/en/Edinburgh/New_Town" title="Edinburgh/New Town">New Town</a> at St James Shopping Centre, 11 Princes St, 101-103 Princes St and 48 Shandwick Pl; in the <a href="/en/Edinburgh/Old_Town" title="Edinburgh/Old Town">Old Town</a> at 40-44 North Bridge), <i>Alliance</i> and <i>Numark</i>.
Outside of these hours you will face more of a challenge. There are no 24 h pharmacies in the city. In the city centre the best option is probably the Boots branch at 48 Shandwick Pl (western extension of Princes Street), M-F 7:30AM-8PM, Sa 8AM-6PM, Su 10:30AM-4:30PM.
Some of the major supermakets include a pharmacy counter, but note that the pharmacy does not necessarily follow the same opening hours as the supermarket itself. The pharmacy counter within the <i>Tesco</i> supermarket at 7 Broughton Road in <a href="/en/Edinburgh/Stockbridge_and_Canonmills" title="Edinburgh/Stockbridge and Canonmills">Canonmills</a> is quite close to the city centre and opens M-Sa 8AM-8PM and Su 10AM-5PM.
For non-prescription medication, <i>Asda</i> are open 24/7 and have a handful of branches dotted around the outskirts.
