<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.christchurch.org.nz/"><b>Christchurch</b></a> is the largest city in the <a href="/en/South_Island" title="South Island">South Island</a> of <a href="/en/New_Zealand" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a> with a 2006 population of over 350,000, making it the second largest city in the country after <a href="/en/Auckland" title="Auckland">Auckland</a>. It is on the edge of the <a href="/en/Canterbury_(New_Zealand)" title="Canterbury (New Zealand)">Canterbury</a> plains and is a major stepping off point for touring the South Island.
Christchurch was established in 1850 by English settlers. Its English heritage shows in the older buildings, especially in the cultural precinct along Worcester Boulevard. The River Avon flows through the central city and disrupts the regular rectangular layout of the city streets.
Christchurch is known as the Garden City, a well-deserved name. Looking from a few floors up, one is struck by the number of trees that grow like a forest throughout the suburbs.
International tourism, especially foreign-student education for the Asian market, was a growing sector of the Christchurch economy, as is electronics and software development. Because of this there is a high concentration of cyber-cafes here.

The port town of <a href="/en/Lyttelton" title="Lyttelton">Lyttelton</a> is separated from Christchurch by the Port Hills. The early settlers had to walk over the <b>Bridle Path</b> - so named because the path was so steep that horses had to be lead by the bridle as they could not be ridden.  Today there is a road tunnel that links the port to the city.
Christchurch is mostly flat, so many people get around on bicycles. Special-purpose bicycle lanes have been recently added to many streets to help promote cycling.
Navigation by car or bicycle is generally simple due to the grid layout, but watch out for one-way streets and bus-and-taxi-only intersections in the central city. Parking in the city uses a pay and display system and costs $2.60/ hour. You can pay with coins, credit card (Visa, MasterCard or Amex) or with a mobile phone text message (the latter two attract a 50c surcharge) then display the ticket with the expiry time visible on the curbside dash.
Renting a car is recommended for ease of transport, although there are public bus services covering the whole city (and the areas of interest for a visitor that may lie outside the central city, such as Sumner and New Brighton Beaches, Lyttelton, Gondola, etc). However in some areas buses may be infrequent, particularly on the weekends when there may only be one or two buses per hour.
The bus service <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.ecan.govt.nz/Our+Environment/Transport/bus-services.htm">[14]</a> has been greatly improved in recent years. Buses interconnect through the temporary Bus Exchange in Tuam Street.  A standard bus fare is $3.20 cash or $2.20 ($4.20 maximum charge per day, $10 minimum initial purchase) with a MetroCard smart card. There is also a free diesel-electric yellow Shuttle that orbits the inner-city area every ten minutes, but often it can be quicker to walk such short distances.  It passes two malls and three supermarkets. (Bus shuttle is not currently operating).
The restored Christchurch Tramway <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://tram.co.nz/">[15]</a> (ticket $12.50, valid for two days) also runs in a smaller loop around the inner city, 09:00-21:00 summer, 09:00-18:00 winter. Please note: this is curretnly out of service.
Cheesemongers still operates from a modern building within its precincts.
10.15-16:00. Information centre open 10:15-16:00 daily summer, 11:00-15:00 winter. 30 hectares of exotic and indigenous plants and trees wrapped in a loop of the picturesque Avon River and linking to the 160-hectare Hagley Park. These put the "Garden" in the "Garden City", and the combined total with Hagley Park makes them the second largest inner city park in the world (after New York's Central Park).
Christchurch has the busiest program of annual festivals of any New Zealand city.
Christchurch's Asian district is mainly in the Riccarton/Upper Riccarton area.
Backpackers are safe, clean, cheap and cheerful. The cheapest option is a share/dorm room usually costing around $28 per night. Most offer single rooms, twin and double rooms and shared rooms. The standard of backpackers is very good in New Zealand.
Motels are a notch up. Low end around $79 per night. There are also many good quality B&amp;Bs in Christchurch and surrounding district.
Many of Christchurch's major hotels are inside the CBD Red Zone &amp; have no public access. Some are damaged other are not but cannot be accessed due to safety restrictions in the area.
Several of the backpackers hostels and most of the motels in Christchurch are located outside the damaged CBD &amp; are fully open for business, just check their websites for updates.

For travellers who want to stay a month or longer, there are a number of furnished flats for rent advertised in the papers. A local company called "Urban Rooms" <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.urbanrooms.co.nz">[54]</a> has a number of furnished rentals specifically for travelers, ranging from rooms in a shared house to self-contained flats with garages.
Christchurch has a problem with smog during the winter.  Although, conditions have improved over the years, due to the severe intervention of the city council, take care venturing out on calm frosty evenings if you have a breathing-related medical condition.
While violent crime is relatively rare, some people do have a tendency towards aggression when drunk, as with most cities. Linwood is considered the 'crime' area of Christchurch, but is still considered safe. As in any city, take care late at night, especially on Friday and Saturdays as levels of intoxication can lead to unwanted attention or unprovoked violence. Avoid dark alleyways and confrontations, and if in doubt, make haste to a populated area and call the police (dial 111).
Christchurch witnessed major earthquakes in 2010 and 2011. The city lies in an earthquake-prone area, but aftershocks have been decreasing in numbers and severity as time passes and are rarely felt.
Being the major gateway to the South Island, Christchurch is often the starting or finishing point for touring the whole South Island.
