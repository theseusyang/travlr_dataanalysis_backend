Discussion on defining district borders for Milan is in progress. If you know the city pretty well, please share your opinion on the <a href="/en/Talk:Milan" title="Talk:Milan">talk page</a>.
<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.milanoinfotourist.com/home.htm"><b>Milan</b></a> (Italian: <i>Milano</i>) is financially the most important city in <a href="/en/Italy" title="Italy">Italy</a>. It has the second most populous city proper in the country, but sits at the centre of Italy's largest urban and metropolitan area. While incorrectly not considered as beautiful as some Italian cities, having been partly destroyed by Second World War bomb raids, the city has rebuilt itself into a thriving cosmopolitan business capital. In essence, for a tourist, what makes Milan interesting compared to other places is that the city is truly more about the lifestyle of enjoying worldly pleasures: a paradise for shopping, football, opera, and nightlife. Milan remains the marketplace for Italian fashion â fashion aficionados, supermodels and international paparazzi descend upon the city twice a year for its spring and autumn fairs. Don't get fooled by the modern aspect of the city, since it's one of the most ancient cities in Europe with more than 26 centuries of history and heritage!
Milan is famous for its wealth of historical and modern sights - the Duomo, one of the biggest and grandest Gothic cathedrals in the world, La Scala, one of the best established opera houses in the globe, the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele, an ancient and glamorous arcaded shopping gallery, the Brera art gallery, with some of the finest artistic works in Europe, the Pirelli tower, a majestic example of 1960s modernist Italian architecture, the San Siro, a huge and famed stadium, or the Castello Sforzesco, a grand medieval castle and the UNESCO's World Heritage Site Santa Maria alle Grazie Basilica, containing one of the world's most famous paintings: Leonardo da Vinci's <i>The Last Supper</i>.
If <a href="/en/Rome" title="Rome">Rome</a> represents the "old" Italy, Milan represents the "new" Italy. Milan is the most modern of all Italian cities, and it still keeps most of its past history intact.
At first sight, Milan looks like a bustling and relatively stylish (with its shiny display windows and elegant shops) metropolis, with a good number of grand palaces and fine churches in the centre, but might seem like a slightly prosaic, soulless and business-orientated place. It can be quite rainy, grey and foggy, and some of the buildings, ancient or modern, have quite a severe appearance. Whilst there are a lot of parks, Milan looks as if it has very little greenery, and apart from the very well-kept historic part, many areas are indeed quite scruffy and dirty. However, Milan, unlike most usually historical European cities which throw the sights in your face, requires quite a lot of exploring - take it as it is, and you might enjoy its fashionable glitter and business-like modernity, but might find it not very "captivating". If you spend time, though, strolling through less well known areas such as the pretty Navigli, the chic Brera district, the lively University quarter, or some of the smaller churches and buildings, you'll find a forward thinking, diverse city filled in every corner with history, and with a plethora of hidden gems. Plus, with such an established history in theatre, music, literature, sport, art and fashion, there's really not much you can miss.
Milan, as many have noticed, doesn't fully feel like a part of Italy. Despite the similarities between typical Italian cities such as <a href="/en/Verona" title="Verona">Verona</a> or <a href="/en/Venice" title="Venice">Venice</a> with the city, it does have a different atmosphere. Milan feels more like a bustling, busy, fashionable business capital - where in several cafes, lots of people only stop to have a quick espresso at the bar counter, and where tourists at times seem even more laid back than the locals. Milan, unlike the traditionally red-terracotta roofed Italian cities, is quite grey, as many buildings are constructed using limestone or dark stones. Ancient buildings mainly have a sort of Austrian/Germanic neoclassical look with some slight French influences. However, with some cycling around in old fashioned bicycles, restaurant chairs and tables outside at summer filled with locals and tourists alike, and people strolling down the pedestrian avenues, licking an ice cream or carrying some heavy shopping bags, Milan does boast some "Italian flair".
These differences between Rome and Milan are evident from several proverbs, such as an Italian saying about the differences of the two cities which roughly translates,<i> "Rome is a voluptuous woman whose gifts are very apparent, while Milan is the shy, demure girl whose treasures are plentiful, but discovered in time."</i>
Milan, depending on how you want to tour the city, is a rewarding visit all the year. Keep in mind most places, including tourist destinations and museums, are closed on Mondays.
In autumn, the weather is warm/cool, and in later months can be quite rainy and foggy. At this time of the year, the city's inhabitants are very busy with work (just kidding), so, the only people you're likely to see wandering around are tourists. All the major venues and shops are open, since it is the working part of the year.
In winter, the city can become cold (often below or around zero degrees centigrade), and the weather is usually foggy and rainy if not snowy. However, the city, in the few weeks before Christmas, becomes delightful to visit - the main sights are all illuminated by stunning lights, a huge Christmas tree is set up in front of the Duomo, vendors and markets can be found everywhere, many shop and display windows are decorated and the streets become bustling with locals and tourists alike. However, the only downside is that it can become extremely crowded, noisy and busy.
In spring, the weather is similar to that of autumn. People go back to work, and the atmosphere becomes more quiet, yet serious unlike that of the winter. Parks become nice to visit, as trees blossom. The city is also quite nice to visit at Carnival, where people dress up and celebrate, and during Easter, where there are special services held in churches and some special events.
In summer, Milan can become extremely hot and humid, with the odd powerful rainstorm here and there. Whilst in July, apart from the weather, most shops remain open, in August, as many locals go off to take their summer holidays, many businesses and venues shut down (with the notice <b>Chiuso per ferie</b>, or shut down for vacation). The city may become quite empty with the odd tourist strolling around, and with several of the main sights shut down. Despite it's not the best time for shopping and the weather's not at all times very pleasant, it's good if you want to enjoy the city to yourself when it's quiet, and maybe want to stroll around, sipping at the odd open bar or at an ice cream, or walking in a silent park. Despite many businesses shut down, some still do remain open, and you will still be able to find some open shops, restaurants and museums. However, the staff may be unfriendly, as Italians do not like to work at this time of the year.
Milan has two main international air gateways, <b>Linate</b> airport and <b>Malpensa</b> airport. Sometimes referred to as Milan's additional airports, Bergamo's <b>Orio al Serio</b> airport <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.bergamo-airport.com">[1]</a>  (45 km East) and <b>Parma</b> airport (100 km South) mostly host budget airlines.
The main international airport is <b>Malpensa</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.malpensa-airport.info/">[2]</a> (Milan Malpensa, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IATA" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:IATA">IATA</a>: <b>MXP</b>). It's a large, modern, two-runway airport. The airport has two terminals, with Terminal 1 being the largest (international and intercontinental flights). Terminal 2 is used by a number of budget airlines, such as Easyjet, and has grown consistently in the last few years (2004-2008). 
The two terminals are connected by a free shuttle bus service (running approximately every 20 minutes). However, such shuttles are very small and the frequency is inadequate: long queues tend to form, which prompts several taxi drivers to station right next to the stop and pick up those passengers who don't want to or can't afford to wait. It is not uncommon for passengers to wait up to 40-45 minutes for the transfers: most shuttles are packed, forcing passengers to wait for the next one.
Some European or national flights arrive at <b>Linate Airport</b> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IATA" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:IATA">IATA</a>: <b>LIN</b>). This small but rather efficient one-runway airport is very close to the city centre (7 km). It is mostly serviced by airlines to domestic destinations and some European destinations. After the bankruptcy of the 'old' Alitalia and its merger with AirOne, the new airline abandoned Malpensa in favour of Linate.
Some budget airlines fly into <b>Orio al Serio Airport</b> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IATA" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:IATA">IATA</a>: <b>BGY</b>) <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.orioaeroporto.it/">[19]</a>. About 45km north-east of Milan near the city of <a href="/en/Bergamo" title="Bergamo">Bergamo</a>.  Ryanair refers to this as <b>Milan Bergamo Airport</b>. Public transport into Milan is slightly less convenient than Malpensa or Linate:
The station building is in itself worth a visit being a masterpiece of rationalist architecture.
The station area is not in a great part of town at night, though in the area there are a number of decent budget hotels (see "Sleep" below) and some business-oriented international brand hotels. In general the area south of the station (characterized by a few skyscrapers) is a business and local government center, pretty active during working hours but almost deserted at night. Should you need a few supplies for your trip, there is a supermarket in the west side of the station in the basement, as well as cafes and other small shops. Internet points in the main square overlooking the station. In 2008 the station is completing extensive renovation. At night, parts of the Central Station become a sleeping area for vagrants. Usually around the station there are children aggressively targeting tourist for pickpocketing, so pay attention to your bag.
The Central Station is served by <b>MM2</b> and <b>MM3</b> metro lines. Taxis stops directly in front of the station (on the sides during the renovation period), and ATM buses on the West side (IV November Square) and buses to Linate, Malpensa and Orio airports on the East side (Luigi di Savoia square).
Ferrovie Nord (FNM) and Trenitalia (FS) are two different railway networks, with different stations, different trains and different tickets. For example, if you need to go to Malpensa airport and you are in FS Greco Pirelli, you need to go first to Garibaldi train station, then take the MM2 metro to Cadorna train station and then the Malpensa Shuttle train to the airport. In some cases from Garibaldi station, you can take the <i>Passante</i> suburban commuter train link to Bovisa FNM station (these trains leave from the underground station below Garibaldi station and next to the MM2 underground station. Be sure that the train you take stops at Bovisa). From Bovisa you can get on the Malpensa shuttle train.
The main motorways linking Milan to the rest of Italy are:
The main highway operating company is SocietÃ  Autostrade per l'Italia <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.autostrade.it/">[27]</a>.
Because of heavy traffic, it is strongly recommended not to drive in Milan during working days. Driving is much better during weekends. A recommendation is to leave your car in one of the well-marked, huge <b>commuter car parks</b> near several exits of Milan's motorway ringroad; they're managed by ATM and are easily connected with Milan's underground metro lines, but they close around midnight. They're near highway exits in Cascina Gobba (East), Lampugnano (North West), Molino Dorino (North West), Bonola (North West), Rho-Pero (North West), Bisceglie (South West) and San Donato (South East). If you must drive in Milan during weekdays, then make sure you have an up-to-date map showing the one-way system.
<b>Traffic congestion fee</b> - Since January 1 2008, cars entering Milan's central area within the former walls of the city (<i>cerchia dei navigli</i>) must pay a fee (â¬2,â¬3, â¬5 or â¬10 depending on the engine and age of the car): there are cameras in all entrances to this area and all registration plates are recorded. Payment can be made by purchasing entrance cards at newspaper stands, online or by sms (call 020202 for information). Failure to pay within 48 hours from entering the area implies a fine of â¬75.
MM1 Lampugnano station is Milan's main Bus terminal.
The main national bus lines are operated by Autostradale <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.autostradale.it/">[28]</a>, but there are many other small companies offering even international travel <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://ibus.it/english/index_en.htm">[29]</a>.
You could also arrive in Milan, by <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.passaggio.it/carpooling/Milano.html">Carpooling Milano</a>.
<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.atm-mi.it/">Azienda Trasporti Milanesi S.p.A.</a> (<b>ATM</b>)operates a public transport network which is pretty efficient (especially the underground lines and the trams (streetcars)). Single tickets cost â¬1.50 and are available from news-stands, tabaccherie (tobacconist - look for large T sign), bars and automatic ticket machines in metro stations. 24 hr tickets cost â¬4.50,  48 hr â¬8.50 (as of Sep 2011), as well as a "carnet" of 10 single trips for â¬13.80. You must have a valid ticket before boarding a bus or tram. Tickets are not sold on board and you will not find a self-service ticket machine at bus and tram stop. You need to buy a valid ticket from one of the places listed above. Single tickets are valid for 90 min, during which you can use them on as many trams and buses as you like, for one metro ride and for one ride on the urban part of  a suburban train. Your time starts once you validate it by inserting it into a box which prints the date and time on it. These are found inside trams and buses and at the turnstiles at the metro. If you've first used a single ticket on a bus or tram, you must also validate it when you enter the metro or before taking the urban part of the suburban train. There still exists three different types of ticket machines on trams and buses. To validate the new-style paper with magnetic strip tickets (these should be the only ones that you will ever be sold) you need to use the orange and yellow machines. If you have a new magnetic credit-card type ticket, you should validate it every time you board on a new bus or a tram as well.
The <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.atm-mi.it/ATM/eng/">Metro</a> (short for Metropolitana) has a big white <b>M</b> on a red background as a logo and has three lines, each commonly identified by a colour as shown below, and is the best way to get around Milan. The lines are: MM1, red (<i>rossa</i>); MM2, green (<i>verde</i>); MM3, yellow (<i>gialla</i>). Lines MM4 and MM5  are under construction to be completed by 2015, as many other extension of existing lines. The subway network is rather extended (lines split into different sections and its 72 stations cover most areas of town). Trains run every 1-3 min, 06:00-23:59 (02:00 on Saturday nights).
(Streetcars) run above-ground on rail lines running through the streets. Milan is par excellence the city of trams, and it's the second city in the world for tramway lines extension. They're everywhere, and they are a true symbol of Milan, just like red double decker bus is for London. Being above ground means you get a view of what you're passing, so if you don't need to go far, they're convenient and fun. Some tram lines are operated by the ultramodern 'jumbo' green tram, others are run by yellow or orange antique traditional carriages (similar to the ones in San Francisco) with wooden panelling inside and glass chandeliers. There is also a restaurant tram and a party tram with disco music. Many tram stops have electronic information panels with indications on how many minutes to wait before the next available service. These are known as trams and an Italian (or non-American foreigner for that matter) will have no idea what you are talking about if you ask them where to find a 'streetcar'. Many trams are really museum pieces, which makes of Milan a sort of an open air transportation museum. The most important historical trams are the "serie 1500" type, dating back as far as 1929! They survived even to the WWII bombings and are still now in perfect conditions. Since their historical value, no retirement option is even considered for these tram types.
Buses should probably be your third public transport option. Equally comfortable, rather punctual and clean with many routes to choose from. ATM tram and bus services stop around 02:00. However, some lines end their service earlier and some do not have a night service at all. In any case check your route and timetable in advance if you want to travel late at night.
Several buses connect suburban cities and towns surrounding Milan. Some are managed by ATM. You can travel on most of them with an inter-urban ticket (biglietto interurbano) which are sold in two forms: including travel in Milan or without. In the <i>without</i> form you can only go to the end of the line, while with the cumulative version you can transfer to any ATM line. There are several rules and distance limits which apply, so be aware of them when you purchase your ticket.
Many bus stops have electronic information panels with indications on how many minutes to wait before the next available service.
20:00-02:00 a special shuttle service is operated by ATM, called <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.atm-mi.it/ATM/Muoversi/Radiobus/">Radiobus</a>, an on-call bus accessible only by pre-booking on +39 2 4803-4803 at least 20 min in advance (a couple of hours is better). The bus will stop at a dedicated place (these have an hexagonal panel with blue writing <b>RADIOBUS</b> and telephone number on white) and will leave you virtually any place. Memorize the pick-up location. The driver will wait for ladies to enter the home door as a courtesy. Costs â¬2 per person. You may buy the tickets in advance, or pay on the bus.
The <b>Suburban Railway System</b> or <b>S-lines</b> (the logo is a big green <b>S</b> on a blue background) includes a special line known as <b>Passante ferroviario</b> (railway link), considered Milan's fourth subway line (although trains run every 6-15 mins), and has eight more lines, each identified by a number (S1, S2, S5, S6, S10 trough Passante Ferroviario and S3, S4, S8, S9, S11 trough other railways), connecting metro area towns with Milan.  Suburban trains run less often than Metro trains (depending on the line, they range from 1 to 4 per hour) but, as some lines share tracks and stations, you can expect as many as 10 trains per hour in central Milan between Lancetti and Porta Vittoria stations. Suburban Railway 'S' Lines are usually marked in blue on subway maps. The Passante is not heavily used by the Milanese and in non-peak hours stations can be deserted so would not be recommended for lone (and particularly female) travellers.
Taxis can be expensive and drivers are allowed to pick passengers up from designated taxi ranks, through phone bookings and directly from the  street. The main taxi companies can be reached at 02.40.40, 02.69.69 or 02.80.80, or alternatively, from a land line dial 848.814.781 to be connected to the nearest taxi stand. If you book a taxi by phone you'll start paying from the moment the driver accepts the call and comes to pick you up. Local law define some fixed fee trips: Milan to Malpensa Airport â¬70, Malpensa Airport-Rho Fair â¬55, Malpensa Airport-Linate Airport â¬85, Linate Airport-Milan Fair â¬40. All fees are intended for a one-way, non-stop trip; taxi waiting time and booking are extras. A surcharge will apply in the evenings so don't be surprised if the meter has â¬6+ on it when you enter, even if at a taxi-stand.
Definitely not a good idea to get into the city centre. Like most major cities traffic is a considerable problem, not to mention the hassle of parking. During working hours traffic is often blocked, inside the city as well as on the highway ring surrounding it. It is much better at night, but you'll probably have problems finding a place to leave the car near enough to nightlife attractions. And a <b>Congestion charge</b> will be applied anywhere from â¬2 to â¬10 per day to enter the second city ring (<i>i Bastioni</i>) in accordance with how much your vehicle pollutes. The charge is only applied on weekdays, 07:30-19:30. Drivers will have to buy a ticket either on-line or from key points in the city.
Walking is definitely a possibility, and although Milan is a large city, many of the main tourist attractions are within an easy and pleasant walk from one another. In recent years, several tourist hot spots, such as the Corso Vittorio Emanuele or the Via Dante have been made pedestrian, so walking shouldn't be a problem. No matter how hot the day, one will see elegantly dressed people of both sexes in timeless fashion without a drop of sweat. There are many places to sit, apart from the ubiquitous cafes, especially in the parks. Get a decent map of the city before setting out though, as the roads do not always maintain a straight line, and the various piazza can be confusing to the newcomer. In the many parks, there are dog only areas, but one should always be careful when walking as the two things one will see on the ground in the streets are cigarette ends and dog faeces.
Bikes are available through the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.bikemi.com">BikeMI bike sharing service</a>. You can register for annual or temporary subscriptions at any BikeMi station. If you register for a temporary subscription (weekly or daily), a user code, along with your password, will be sent to the e-mail address, chosen during your registration. Your codes are active as soon as you receive them. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.bikedistrict.org">BikeDistrict</a> is a website that offers cycling directions to get around safely in the city. Entering the departure and destination addresses, BikeDistrict finds the best itinerary for bikes, avoiding as far as possible cobblestones, tram rails, busy streets and the routes which are potentially dangerous for cyclists. The suggested route is displayed on a map and colored according to the cycling level of every street, together with real-time information about bike sharing stations and with the location of cycling-related services, such as bike repair shops.
There are lot and a huge variety of things you can see in Milan - from fine churches, old palaces, excellent museums, world class theatres and opera houses, cultural gems, striking buildings, sleek modern architectural works and lovely streets and squares. But remember, not all of them are right in the absolute centre - some of the most wonderful gems can be found near the outskirts or even outside of Milan.  Note, though, that most museums are closed on Mondays.
Milan offers the visitor a large variety of art museums, mainly of Italian Renaissance and Baroque.
Other Museums:
Milan has the oldest churches in Italy (yes-- older than the ones in Rome because Milan was the capital of the Northern part of the late Roman Empire). Milan has more ancient and monumental churches than any other European city outside of Italy. You can see a very complete collection <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.skyscrapercity.com/showthread.php?t=1497363">here</a>.
Some of the most beautiful churches one can see in Milan are:
Despite not having as much greenery as some cities, Milan offers several parks and gardens, scattered all over the city.
Milan is a great city to walk around and see the sights and people.
Milan has 8 universities and the largest number of students in Italy.
Almost every Milan university has several facilities around the city and some of them also have secondary centres in other areas of Lombardy and Italy, so if you need something specific you'd better ask before getting there. Every university has its own students' residences, which are much smaller than they should be, so they can satisfy only a small portion of demand for them. If you're not able to get a room in a residence, every university has an ISU, a Studying Right Institute, that can help you find a room or an apartment for rent.  Renting a room or an apartment can be very expensive, starting at â¬400-500 /month for a room. <b>MeglioMilano</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.meglio.milano.it/">[59]</a> is an association that is now experimenting a project to help non-Milanese students find a home and retired old people find somebody to help them in everyday life. The project is called <b>Prendi in casa uno studente</b> (Bring a student home), you can ask for information by email (<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="mailto:meglio.segreteria@meglio.milano.it">mailto:meglio.segreteria@meglio.milano.it</a>) or by phone on (+39) 02 76020589.
Milan, being a worldwide trendsetter, is a fashion shoppers' paradise.
There is pretty much every form of shopping in this city that one can imagine: from the designer's prestigious emporia, retail giants' outlets, small entrepreneur's tiny and funky boutiques, to second-hand average shops.
The main shopping area is the so-called Fashion Quadrangle (<i>quadrilatero della moda</i>), a set of neoclassical blocks roughly between Duomo Square (Piazza Duomo), Cavour Square (Piazza Cavour) and San Babila Square (Piazza San Babila). Here in Montenapoleone Street (with prime brand shops), Della Spiga Street, Vittorio Emanuele Street, Sant' Andrea Street, Porta Venezia avenue and Manzoni Street, it contains the most prestigious boutiques and showrooms in the world. Everything reeks of ostentation and the splendor of a chic, fashionable lifestyle. Shop windows shine, exhibiting the trendiest shoes, coolest glasses, funkiest dresses, most glamorous clothes, and most luxurious crystal chandeliers.* <span class='vcard' id = 'Via_Montenapoleone_has_a_dedicated_site'><span class="fn org">Via Montenapoleone has a dedicated site</span>,  (<span class="note directions">Metro: Via Montenapoleone</span>),  (<a class="email" href="mailto:info@viamontenapoleone.org" rel="nofollow">info@viamontenapoleone.org</a>), <a class="url external autonumber" href="http://www.viamontenapoleone.org/eng/home.php" rel="nofollow">[60]</a>. <span class="description">Shop Directory and Shop infos available</span> &#160;<a class="listing-edit" href="#Via_Montenapoleone_has_a_dedicated_site" onclick="editListing('Via_Montenapoleone_has_a_dedicated_site', 'buy', 'Milan');return false;" title="click to edit Via Montenapoleone has a dedicated site" rel="nofollow">edit</a></span>
Located near MM1 <i>San Babila</i> or MM3 <i>Montenapoleone</i> subway stations.
For people wanting to spend a bit less while still buying beautiful pieces, other areas are better. One of these is Vercelli Avenue (MM1 <i>Pagano</i>, MM1 <i>Conciliazione</i> subway stations), another one is Buenos Aires Avenue (MM1 <i>Porta Venezia</i>, MM1 <i>Lima</i>, MM1/MM2 <i>Loreto</i> subway stations), reputed as being the longest shopping street of Europe.
Corso Buenos Aires connects Porta Venezia to Piazzale Loreto, and is even more commercial: here you can find Calzedonia, Alex Fashion, Luisa Spagnoli, Furla, Brian &amp; Barry and Nara Camice.
The Brera district (<i>Lanza</i>, or <i>Montenapoleone</i> metro stops) is also not to be missed for trendy and young, yet stylish, boutiques. The Brera district is great for other things, such as browsing through ancient rare art stores and galleries, sipping a hot drink at a refined-air cafe, attending a funky disco, or looking for exotic furniture. However, today, there are a lot of young designers who have up-and coming boutiques, which are slightly less expensive than their Montenapoleone counterparts, but are quite fashionable and of high quality. The Brera district is great because it combines chic, old-air shops, with zeitgeist, modernist and youthful ones. Jewelry stores include Papic oro e argento or Alcozer &amp; J. Bijoux, fashion shops include Accessori or Laura Ashley, and furniture stores include Zohar or Lucitalia.
Let us not forget, the Piazza del Duomo, Via Dante, Piazza San Babila, Galleria Victor Emanuel and the Corso Giacomo Matteoti, which are excellent shopping places. In the Galleria, you get brand fashion stores, two bookstores (Rizzoli and Libreria Bocca) and a sliverware store called Bernasconi plus a Gucci cafe (and many, many more!). In the Corso Giacomo, you can find Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, in Piazza del Duomo you have Grimoldi, Ruggeri, Donna and La Rinascente department store, in Piazza San Babila you can find Upim, Eddy Monetti, Guess and Valextra, and there are loads of shops in the Via Dante, so there are really heaps of shopping opportunities in this area.
For hipsters, there's the elongated Porta Ticinese area, especially on Saturday, when the flea market <b>Fiera di Senigallia</b> takes place near the Darsena (2008: currently that area is closed and Fiera di Senigallia has been moved to a place near Porta Genova MM2 subway and train station). This is a great place to wander and browse, and save money if you've somehow survived Milan's high end boutiques. Sort through new and second-hand clothes, old furniture, fake art nouveau lamps, perfumed candles and every kind of essence, books, comics, records, videos and DVDs. In the Corso Ticense, several shops, such as Diesel, RVM Orologi, Dress, Energie, Colors &amp; Beauty, Tintoria La Boutique, Blu Max, Le Jean Marie, Brazilian, Ethic, L'Uomo outlet, Les Tropezziennes, Atelier cucine e ..., Panca's Show Room, or Cinius (and loads more) are present. There are also several banks and post offices, such as the Banca Popolare and Poste Italiane, and a CTS Viaggi travel agency. Thus, with so many shops, you can keep your shopping bags full, and browse even further.
The other market in Milan is the Mercatone del Naviglio Grande. This takes place along the Alzaia Naviglio Grande on the last Sunday of each month. Dedicated to antiques, the market has over 400 exhibitors, so you're certain to find something that catches your eye.
If outlet shopping is your thing, the shopping outlet in Serravalle Scrivia (a town roughly an hour's drive from Milan <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.mcarthurglen.it/serravalle/home/home.php">[69]</a> is a good bet. Tour company-operated buses, including one that leaves from near the Castle, will take you there and back (roughly â¬20 for the round-trip as of early 2008). Reputed to be the first designer outlet in Italy and the biggest in Europe. Over 180 stores stock clothing, footwear and accessories, and it has a parking with 3,000 parking lots, a children's playground, bars and restaurants. In central Milan, you also get some good outlets too, such as Vestistock, D Magazine, or 10 Corso Como (and several more) which all have designer clothes and other interesting features. Corso Buenos Aires is the best street in the city for outlet shopping, since it contains many of the big shopping centres or department stores.
Although Milan is a city that changes its mind as quickly as fashion trends come and go, it remains one of the strongest bastions of traditional Italian cooking, where homemade elements are still very much praised and appreciated. There are trattorias, enoteche (wine bars) and restaurants (including luxury ones) everywhere that offer traditional Milanese and Italian dishes to eat. This city's traditional cooking is based on filling dishes like osso buco (braised veal shanks) and risotto alla milanese (chicken-broth risotto made with saffron).
Dining times tend to be a shade earlier than in Rome or Florence, with lunch generally served between 12:30PM and 2:30PM and dinner from 7:30PM to 9:30PM. Dinner, and sometimes lunch, are usually preceded by that great Milanese institution, the aperitivoâa glass of sparkling wine or a Campari soda in a sophisticated hotel bar.
Chinese restaurants are mainly located around via Paolo Sarpi, the heart of Milan's Chinatown.
Avoid the restaurants around the Duomo, they tend to be tourist-only spots, with low quality food at inflated prices. Be aware that most restaurants charge an extra "serving tax", approximate 2 Euros per consumer. Also avoid restaurants or cafes around the central station, where it has been reported that hidden serving tax can be up to 5 euros per person with cheap quality food.
The city also features an excellent cafe called <b>Brek</b> with several locations throughout Milan, including one near Piazza San Babila. The food is very good, the prices are fair, and it's a good place to stop for a quick bite.
For an artistic dining experience, try <b>Lacerba</b> on via dei Orti, 4, which serves dishes inspired by the early 20th century art movement, Futurism.
In the last several years, Milan has established a local version of the Aperitivo or Happy Hour. Italians drink very moderately and "happy hour" is not a drinking, but a social event.
Roughly from 7PM to 9PM, many bars offer drinks and cocktails at a fixed price (â¬5-8 each), accompanied by free all-you-can-eat buffets with snacks, pastas, and many other small appetizers. But be careful not to confuse "aperitivo" with "free dinner". It's a snack to be enjoyed with a drink. Italians will immediately see you as a buffoon- and it's seen as tacky to fill up on finger food for dinner, although it's common to spot them doing so.
A great place to go is the Straf Hotel <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.straf.it/concept_eng.htm">[70]</a> near the Duomo. A whole lot of these places can be found in the area near the Colonne di san Lorenzo and Corso di porta Ticinese, or close by in the Navigli area (subway: MM2 <i>Porta Genova</i> Station).  You can also take the #3 tram to "Ventiquattro" stop.  From Porta Ticinese (the large archway), head west into the canal area of Navigli.  There are great restaurants for aperitivo in this area, including:
La Ringhiera: Ripa di Porta Ticinese, 5
Slice: Via Cardinale Ascanio Sforza, 9
Mas: Ripa di Porta Ticinese, 11
Another great area for aperitivo, not far from Duomo, is <i>Corso Buenos Aires</i>.
Around this area you can find cool cocktail bars like:
<b>b:free cocktail bar</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.bfreecocktailbar.com">[71]</a>: Via Lecco, 21 (close to Porta Venezia metro stop)
The Eat-Mi guide available on www.eatmi.it is useful for tourists that want to taste typical Italian cuisine.
At the Osteria del Gnocco Fritto, the â¬4.50 cover charge includes baskets of fried hand-size pastries (similar to sopapillas) accompanied by meats, cheeses, or jams (â¬8 to â¬11). Osteria del Gnocco Fritto has two locations: at Via Pestalozzi, 16, 02 8912.2631 and off the Grand Canal at Via Pasquale Paoli, 2, 02 5810.0216.
The Osteria dei Formaggi on the Grand Canal (Alzaia Naviglio Grande, 54, 02 8940 9415) serves all manner of excellent cheese dishes in an intimate dining room heavily decorated with cows.
In bars you can enjoy great caffÃ¨ espresso, cappuccino and a brioche for as little as â¬2. At bars in the Duomo and San Babila areas, breakfast can be very expensive if you sit down. If in doubt go to the bar and eat there, you'll pay what the Italians do- and they will admire your audacity too.
Milan, as a big city, is filled with several different forms of fast-foods, from the foreign giants and national chains, to independantly-owned take-aways and sandwich bars. Most fast-food restaurants are found in the Duomo, Buenos Aires and central station areas, as these are the most crowded and busy ones in the city. In the Piazza Duomo and Galleria, one can find international fast-foods such as <b>McDonald's</b> and <b>Burger King</b>, but Italian chains such as <b>Autogrill</b> are found too. Such Italian fast-food chains, such as <b>Spizzico</b>, <b>Ciao</b> and Autogrill can be found all over the city. There are several Ciao outlets in places such as no. 12 Corso Europa or no. 54 Via Montebianco, and for McDonald's, you get a restaurant in the Piazza del Duomo and Galleria, and also some in the Corso Buenos Aires, plus some others in places such as Corso Vercelli or Piazzale Lotto. Other fast-foods which can be found in Milan include <b>Garbagnati</b> (<i>Cordusio</i> metro station) which is a self-service restaurant and bakery, which has several vegeterian courses, or the <b>Luini</b> (<i>Duomo</i> metro station) which is a restaurant which is famous for making Southern Italian-style pieces of dough with mozzarella and tomatoes inside.
Although Milan cannot claim to be the birthplace of pizza, (that claim belongs to Naples), you can still find good pizzas in Milan. The best areas for pizza are near Marghera street, at the end of Vercelli Avenue, and on the Navigli, on Brera. Expect to pay â¬8-15 for a pizza and a beer.
If you are in the Northeast area, there are many little pizzerias on viale Fulvio Testi (the northern extension of viale Zara) in the Greco area, of which an excellent choice is Pizzeria De Pino. Ask for John Luca, and don't miss the lasagne. Here you may also get homemade Mirto (as you can at many other places). The prices are very reasonable in these establishments; expect to pay about â¬4-5 for pizza and â¬3-4 for beer. These places are where the locals eat, they are very friendly and helpful but few speak anything but Italian. Take the phrase book with you.
Another restaurant on the viale Fulvio Testi that is a real recommendation is Pizzeria De BassiÃ©. They offer really good homemade pizzas and especially their special "Adriano" pizza is a really good option!
In Milan, pizza is often eaten with a knife and fork, but of course eating with one's hands is possible and welcome. Most people do both.
Watch out for frozen pizza in Milan (it usualy states it on the menu). Always check the restaurant has a wood burning oven and that they are using it.
Pizza Fashion near the Centrale train station is good choice and they also do takeaway dessert if you're running to catch your train.
In summer enjoy gelato, an excellent Italian ice cream. The quality mark "gelato artigianale" indicates gelaterias that produce their own ice creams, without industrial processing.
Bakeries are open every day, you can enjoy great and inexpensive bread-related food, such as pizza and focaccia. You can find a bakery almost everywhere in Milan, even in the Duomo area, and is a good alternative to bars for a fast lunch.
There is much confusion regarding tipping in Italy. Italians do not typically leave tips any more at restaurants. In touristy locations there will often be a line (a recent trend) left blank for a tip to be added. Just draw a line through it and leave a few Euros. Never leave tips at bar counters.
There are plenty of bars and cafÃ©s in Milan of all kinds - from fancy old-fashioned ones, where you can enjoy a formal hot drink, to avant-garde modern places, and youthful spots for a happy hour/late-night drink. Some also offer some food too. These are only a few of the places where you can stop for a drink:
Milan has a great variety of places where you can have fun. A great starting point is Como Avenue (<b>Corso Como</b>), near Garibaldi Station, full of bars and glamorous clubs. In the summertime, this street is packed with young and attractive people.
Another place where you can go is <b>Navigli</b> quarter, near Porta Ticinese Avenue and XXIV Maggio Square, where you can find a lot of small pubs, open air cafes and restaurants by the water canals (<i>navigli</i>). In many pubs and bars you can find a free booklet named <b>Zero2</b> which is a guide to Milan Nightlife: if you don't know what to do or where to go, do grab one!
Other popular night spots with bars and people are viale Monte Nero (on Wednesday it's packed with people in the piazza in front of a bar called "Momo"), Piazzale Susa (and Citta' Studi area). Nights are overwhelmingly crowded at the <b>Colonne di San Lorenzo</b> (not far from Navigli quarter), and in the cozy Latin-quarter of <b>Brera</b>. Another good spot is the pedestrian part of Corso Sempione near the "Peace Arch" (<b>Arco della Pace</b>).
There are bars and clubs open all week long but usually few people go out at night on Mondays or Tuesdays, the vast majority prefer to have fun on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays. However, Wednesday night appears to be one of the coolest to go out in stylish VIP-frequented clubs.
Milan has an alternative club scene, with a few crews making electronic music parties outside clubs. Ultracheap, every time in a different location (lofts, warehouses, farms, pools, city parks) those kind of parties attract people aged 20-28. The biggest one is called RESET! <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.wearereset.com">[90]</a>and attracts 1500-2000 people once a month
Although Milan has a variety of bars, clubs, restaurants and venues for gay and lesbian travellers, many only operate one night a week. Choosing from one of the "mainstays" below and asking anyone where to go should lead you in the right direction. 
Also, venues are not concentrated in one area of town, but rather spread throughout the city. 
Foreign travelers are often confused by the ARCI card regime that is required for entry into many clubs. It's a relic from the times of police raids that has now conferred tax benefits on these private club owners. No need to fear-- just show up and purchase one at any of the clubs. You MUST bring some ID or you cannot purchase one.
Cruising clubs such as the "Flexo" and "Depot" are hugely popular in Italy, perhaps even more so than saunas. 
The best saunas in 2008 include Metro (via Schiaparelli near the Central Station, subway: MM2 and MM3 <i>Centrale</i> Station) and Royal Hammam (near BinarioUno club, via Plezzo, subway: MM2 <i>Lambrate</i> Station), mostly packed during the weekend especially at night as they are open 24 hours. 
Open air meeting places such as Parco Nord, the gardens behind Cadorna station or Ortomercato are not recommended (criminals and hustlers). The safest way to cruise is to take the late night metro and get into the second-last coach, which is usually occupied by the gays and lesbians.

However, the campsite itself has a bar, a restaurant and very good shower facilities. This is definitely an option for students or people who would rather spend money in Milan, instead of accommodation.
<b>Hostels</b>
<b>Hotels</b>
All these have ensuite facilities, shower, bath, WC, TV in room, 24 hour lobby.

The nearest underground stop is at 100 metres from the Residence (Caiazzo stop, green line MM2) while Stazione Centrale stop is at 300 metres (yellow line MM3). Excecutive Apartament for one week from â¬770.
Unless you venture into the dangerous suburbs, Milan is a rather safe city. Certain areas near Loreto, Central station, and Porto di Mare (Southern end of the yellow metro line) can be unsafe in the night. At the station, do not seek help from any random person offering to help with the booking machines / ATMs or under any other pretext. After they have helped, they will pursue you to get as much money as possible for their "help". Or they can pretend to be helpful, cheating instead. A possible scenario: they guide you through the interface of the ticket machine in a metro station, and advice you to pay using notes instead of coins (allegedly the ticket machine wouldn't accept coins). If you insert a 20 euro note, the machine would give it back after a few moments. However, before it happens, they will grab your attention saying that the ticket should appear in the bottom of the machine, and simultaneously an old beggar with body odour will appear begging for money. You wouldn't notice it but the beggar will collect the 20 euro note that the machine would give  back to you. The "helper" would then show to you that the maximum amount of change given by the machine is less than 10 euros.
Beware of the migrant vendors in the streets: most of the merchandise they sell is imitation/fake luxury goods. Even at a fraction of the cost of the original merchandise, the quality is spotty, and the goods are not well maintained in storage.
They may also try giving you "free" friendship bracelets (sometimes calling them 'a gift').  After you take the bracelet, a coloured piece of string, they will hit you up for money and relentlessly pursue you until they get as much as they can.
They will be forceful, physically tying the bracelet to your wrist, or laying it on your shoulder as you try and walk away. This is especially true in the tourist areas around the <b>Duomo</b> and <b>Castello Sforzesco</b>. They usually first ask "Where are you from?"
Just ignore them. In empty places, watch for strangers directly approaching you. Try to be with other people like in a bus station or a shopping mall.
Beware of people hanging around the square outside Duomo: they will walk up to you and forcefully give you corn on the hands to feed the pigeons on the pretence that they are free. All the pigeons in the surrounding area will then fly to you. The people will then relentlessly pursue you and ask you for money.
Stay away from the area around the central railway station at night.
Be careful crossing the street: drivers don't usually respect pedestrian crossings unless there is a red light for them to stop.
