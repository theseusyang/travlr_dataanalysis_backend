<b>Izmir</b> is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of around 3.7 million, the second biggest port after <a href="/en/Istanbul" title="Istanbul">Istanbul</a>, and a very good transport hub.  It is a rapidly growing city on the <a href="/en/Central_Aegean" title="Central Aegean">Central Aegean</a> coast of <a href="/en/Turkey" title="Turkey">Turkey</a>.
Once the ancient city of <b>Smyrna</b>, Ä°zmir is now a modern, developed, and busy commercial center, set around a huge bay and surrounded by mountains. The broad boulevards, glass-fronted buildings and modern shopping centers are dotted with traditional red-tiled roofs, the 18th century market, and old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere more of Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The history of Izmir stretches back to around 3000 BC when the Trojans founded the city in Tepekule in the northern suburb of Bayrakli. This was the birthplace of Homer, who was thought to have lived here around the 8th century BC. The Aeolians, the first Greek settlers, were eventually taken over by their Greek rivals the Ionians. The Ionians were followed by the Lydians who destroyed the city around 600BC before a brief recovery following Alexander the Greatâs arrival in 334 BC.
After his death, Alexanderâs generals followed his wishes and re-established Smyrna on Mount Pagos in Kadifekale, and the city then prospered under the Romans. It was destroyed by an earthquake in 178 AD but later reconstructed and became a major commercial port during the Byzantine Empire. After the Byzantines, the city had a turbulent time under the Arabs, Seljuks, Crusaders and Mongols, until Mehmet I incorporated it into the Ottoman Empire in 1415. Under Suleyman the Magnificent, Smyrna became a thriving and sophisticated city and a huge trading center, despite its frequent earthquakes. It was a cosmopolitan city , with a Greek Orthodox majority along with Armenians, Jews and Muslims. Numerous languages could be heard in the streets, spoken by locals and visiting traders.
Following World War I and the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, and on the basis of the majority Greek population in the area, Greece was granted a mandate over Izmir from the Allies. Athens took control over the whole of the Aegean region.
Rising tensions led the outbreak of war as the Greeks purshed further into the heart of Anatolia in an attempt to unite the Greek communities of Asia Minor. Led by Kemal Ataturk the Turkish army launched a counter-attack and seized the city. Soon thereafter 70% of the city burned to the ground by the Turkish forces. The 'Great Fire' ended multinational authority of the city and the Greek and Armenian populations were expelled.
Ataturk formally took Izmir on 9 September 1922, which is celebrated as the day of the city's liberation.
Dry and sunny <b>summers</b> in Izmir are so infernally hot and sticky that, unless there is an air-conditioning in your room, you will most likely have trouble falling asleep at least on your first night, no matter whether the windows are wide open or not. However, a mild breeze coming in ashore from the sea (locally called <i>meltem</i>) may refreshen the evenings, at least in locations close to the waterfront. Temperature can drop down to freezing point (0&#176;C/32&#176;F) in mostly windy and rainy <b>winters</b>, however snowfall is some sort of curiousness in these latitudes, which happens once or at most twice a decade, if at all.
Izmir has two railway stations: <b>Basmane</b> in the city center serves regional trains and the Metro, and <b>Alsancak</b> in the north serves intercity trains and the IZBAN.
The main intercity services include: <a href="/en/Ankara" title="Ankara">Ankara</a> (<i>Mavi Tren</i> is the fastest at 14 hours), <a href="/en/Denizli" title="Denizli">Denizli</a> (3 express trains daily, 5-6 hours) and <a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Isparta&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Isparta (page does not exist)">Isparta</a> (9 hours). Trains for <a href="/en/Istanbul" title="Istanbul">Istanbul</a> connect with a ferry at <a href="/en/Bandirma" title="Bandirma">Bandirma</a>.
Basmane station is linked by metro (which has a seperate station than the train one) to Konak in the west and to Bornova in the east.
The weekend ferry from Izmir to Istanbul has been suspended (2009), one or two weekly ferries between Izmir and <a href="/en/Venice" title="Venice">Venice</a> (67 hours). All ferries dock at the Alsancak Ferry Terminal, 2km north of the city center.
Cruise ships call on the port of Izmir all year round at Alsancak<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.whatsinport.com/Izmir.htm">[1]</a>.  The center of town, Konak, is about 2 km south of Alsancak.  When you exit the pier area, turn right at the waterfront and follow the Kordon to Konak, about a 25 minute stroll.
Adnan Menderes Airport (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IATA" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:IATA">IATA</a>: <b>ADB</b>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICAO" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:ICAO">ICAO</a>: <b>LTBJ</b>), 16 km south of the city center, has several daily flights to <a href="/en/Istanbul" title="Istanbul">Istanbul</a>, <a href="/en/Ankara" title="Ankara">Ankara</a>, and <a href="/en/Antalya" title="Antalya">Antalya</a>. There are also regular flights from many <a href="/en/Europe" title="Europe">European</a> cities.
Iz Air <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.izair.com.tr">[2]</a> is a local carrier operating out of Adnan Menderes and offers many domestic connections.
From the airport, you have three public transport options into the city:
Tickets can be bought at manned booths ("gise"). There is a local transport card for residents but you can also prefer "3-5 Bilet" <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.eshot.gov.tr/Content.aspx?MID=126&amp;Menuadi=3-5%20Bilet&amp;SayfaTip=1&amp;Sayfa=4">[4]</a>  (3-5 Tickets) for short term stays. Price depends on how many trips you will make. It costs 6,5 TL and 15,2 TL for 2 and 5 trips respectively. (October 2013) Please note that you cannot buy one way 3-5 Bilet as the minimum fare covers two trips.
The bus station, or <i>otogar</i>, is 6km north east of town although there are plenty of <i>dolmuÅ</i> that make the journey there from the centre. The bus station is huge and has an internet cafe, plenty of facilities for food and drink and a large number of agencies selling tickets for coaches which, if departing imminently, they will be shouting out the destinations of. It also has pay toilets.
Buses to <a href="/en/Istanbul" title="Istanbul">Istanbul</a> take 9 hours (including a brief trip on a ferry) and travellers are provided with water, hot drinks, snacks and regular stops for toilets and food all for free on the better services for fares around 50TL per person one way.
Due to the Great Fire of 1920s, there is a relative lack of historical sights in Izmir, especially when considered how old the city really is (more than 5000 years old).
You can go to Konak Pier, a small mall along the Kordon with a cinema and with local and other known brands.
Another mall is called Forum, in Bornova. Forum is a very big mall with all brands and a supermarket in a Mediterreanean style one floored houses in open air. <b>KemeraltÄ±</b> (in the city center) offers great deal of souveniers in a nice traditional athmosphere.
Join the nightlife on KÄ±brÄ±s Åehitleri Caddesi in Alsancak, and go find the Gazi Kadinlar Street. Wednesdays, Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays are when the street is liveliest.
In Izmir there are many hotels which are suitable for all tastes and budgets. Hilton, Swissotel and Movenpick are just a few minutes away by foot from Cumhuriyet Meydani (Republic Square) Hotel Ibis is very close to the city center, located nearby Alsancak Railway Station. Also there is Crowne Plaza, which is about 30 min. from center.
Izmir is a relatively safe city for its size, however it does have its "shady" areas. The city center as well as populated suburbs are generally safe during the day. Use common sense if walking at night, avoid dark and narrow alleyways (found mainly in Alsancak and Konak). Avoid the streets around the main port as well as the streets around the railway junction (Hilal, Halkapinar). Also avoid booking hostels around Basmane that is not safe even in the daylight. Kadifekale, which is one of the city's main landmarks is located in arguably the city's most dangerous area. It is not advised to go there alone; if you go travel by car. It is not advisable to travel on foot in the neighborhoods on the south side of the train tracks near the city center at any time of the day. 
Use common sense and you will be relatively safe. If you find yourself in any situation don't be afraid to call the police (155).Izmir Police Department has a "tourism police" section where travellers can report passport loss and theft or any other criminal activity, they may have become victims of. The staff is multilingual and will speak English, German, French, and Arabic.
