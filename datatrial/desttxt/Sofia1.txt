<b>Sofia</b> (Ð¡Ð¾ÑÐ¸Ñ) is the capital of <a href="/en/Bulgaria" title="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a>. It is also the biggest city in the country with about 1.4 million citizens (including suburbs). Today, Sofia is a dynamic Eastern European capital, distinguished by its unique combination of European and Communist-style architecture as well as many beautiful orthodox churches. Furthermore, it claims to be one of the few European capitals with beautiful scenery and a developed ski-resort so close to it - the Vitosha mountain.
When planning a visit to Sofia, keep in mind the major national holidays (Christmas, Orthodox Easter, 1st, 6th and 24th of May, 6th of September). During this period the city is getting empty as most citizens take advantage of the long weekend and travel on vacation. Most small shops and galleries stay closed.
Sofia was founded around 2,500 years ago. Over the centuries, it has been given several names - Serdica , Sredetz and the remains of the old cities can still be viewed today. Because of its strategic location in the middle of Balkans for a while it had been selected for a new capital of the Roman Empire.
Near Sofia is the Boyana church, one of the most valuable memorials of Bulgarian and European culture. The church has frescoes, acclaimed by specialists as âthe best examples of Eastern medieval art during its twelve century historyâ.
The decline of Sofia during the Turkish Ottoman Empire was followed by the rejuvenation after the Russian liberation in 1878, when Sofia was chosen as the capital of Bulgaria at the First National Constituent Assebly, and followed by a brisk and straight-forward period of construction.
Sofia has a humid continental climate with an average annual temperature of 10.2 Â°C (50.4 Â°F).
Winters are cold and snowy. In the coldest days temperatures can drop as low as -15Â°C or even lower, most notably in January. Foggy conditions are frequent, especially in the beginning of the season. On average, Sofia receives a total snowfall of 90 cm (35.5 in) and around 60 days with snow cover.
Summers are warm and sunny. In summer, Sofia generally remains slightly cooler than other parts of <a href="/en/Bulgaria" title="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a>, due to its higher altitude. However, the city is also subjected to heat waves with high temperatures reaching or exceeding 35Â°C in the hottest days, particularly in July and August.
Springs and autumns in Sofia are short with variable and dynamic weather.
The city receives an average annual precipitation of 591 mm (23.27 in), reaching its peak in the beginning of the summer when <a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Thunderstorms&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Thunderstorms (page does not exist)">thunderstorms</a> are common.
Sofia Airport <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.sofia-airport.bg/">[1]</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IATA" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:IATA">IATA</a>: <b>SOF</b>) (<a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Template:I&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Template:I (page does not exist)">Template:I</a>) is the busiest airport in Bulgaria and it was built around 1930. Its Terminal 2 is now the active one and was constructed in 2009. The airport is located only 10 km from the city center, in the eastern part of the capital.

There are a few domestic flights, from <a href="/en/Varna" title="Varna">Varna</a> and <a href="/en/Burgas" title="Burgas">Burgas</a>, including some charter flights.
Make sure you check the terminal that you are arriving at or departing from carefully.
Terminal 1 (T1) is used by budget airlines like EasyJet, Germanwings and Wizz Air; and by charter flight operators.
Terminal 2 (T2) handles all 'traditional' carriers, and serves as a hub to Bulgaria Air, the national carrier.
Terminal 1 (T1) has postal and banking services, a news stand, two coffee shops and one duty-free shop.
Terminal 2 (T2) is larger and has more duty-free shops, three coffee shops with some food offers. Before passport control there is only one coffee shop and a news stand.
Funded Airport Terminal 2 has one Moneyexchange Office in the public Area with rates that are acceptable for an airport (Feb 2012). There is also an ATM next to it. There is also one small and very expensive Money Exchange Office in the Arrival Area, after Passport Control and before Baggage Claim, but with horrible Rates!!!
There is a white shuttle bus running every 30 minutes between the two terminals, you should ask at the information about it. It is free. There are a few kilometers between the two terminals and they are not in a walking distance. Be aware that even if you decide to walk, you may get lost as the path is not marked and it could take you 20-30 minutes.
From the airport you catch bus #84 and get off at the Pliska bus stop (it's a popular place, just ask someone in the bus, there is a building called Pliska). Then from the Pliska bus stop you should catch one of those buses: 404, 305, 413, 214, 213. Any of them will take you to the central bus/railway station.
<br />
The Central Bus Station (Centralna Avtogara/Ð¦ÐµÐ½ÑÑÐ°Ð»Ð½Ð° Ð°Ð²ÑÐ¾Ð³Ð°ÑÐ°) <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.centralnaavtogara.bg/">[8]</a> is located near the city center. The website gives a listing of all domestic and international departure &amp; arrival times and costs. Bear in mind that there are three other bus stations for minor destinations.
Timetable of International bus by major bus company MATPU 96: <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.matpu.com/bg_international_lines.php">[9]</a> in Bulgarian.
International trains provide a large number of routes to Sofia, arriving from such places as <a href="/en/Kiev" title="Kiev">Kiev</a>, <a href="/en/Istanbul" title="Istanbul">Istanbul</a>, <a href="/en/Vienna" title="Vienna">Vienna</a>, <a href="/en/Belgrade" title="Belgrade">Belgrade</a>, <a href="/en/Bucharest" title="Bucharest">Bucharest</a>, <a href="/en/Moscow" title="Moscow">Moscow</a> and other common cities.
Trains from Istanbul are temporarily under renovation and thus, will not be made available until the end of 2013.  Check with the latest news on trains from Istanbul, into mainland Europe, including Sofia.
The primary trains from <a href="/en/Bucharest" title="Bucharest">Bucharest</a> to Sofia, and back, run twice daily through the border cities of <a href="/en/Giurgiu" title="Giurgiu">Giurgiu</a> and <a href="/en/Rousse" title="Rousse" class="mw-redirect">Ruse</a>. For example, recent trains are scheduled from Bucharest to Sofia in the daytime departing 12:16/arriving 21:33 and a night train departing 20:04/arriving 06:00. From Sofia to Bucharest there are also two trains: a) Sofia 07:45 - Bucharest 17:19 and b) Sofia 19:30 - Bucharest 05:44. One way ticket is 140 Romanian Leu. Discounts are available for under 25s. Passport control and customs takes place in Giurgiu (RO) and Ruse (BG), approximately mid-trip. Check local train stations for more up to date information.
Unfortunately trains to Greece are discontinued (March-2012)
From Belgrade: 10h, one overnight train. Return ticket cost â¬41.20 and â¬6 for couchette reservation.
To Istanbul, the train costs 70 leva, the train departs at around 18:30 and arrives at 9:00.
All services are operated by the Bulgarian State Railways <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.bdz.bg/">[10]</a>, whose schedules are available on the internet in English.
The main railway station (<i>Tsentralna Gara</i>) can be somewhat confusing. Domestic departures go from the main terminal and that is where you can buy tickets for domestic travel. If you want to travel to an international destination, on entering the station from the front, turn to your left, walk past the heated waiting room on  your left (and some small shops) and go to the office at the end of the wide corridor with "RILA" on it. It is straight ahead of you. They speak some English and to book a ticket, you will need your passport. They take credit cards.
Platforms can be accessed from the main floor down the escalators at the far left corner. Platform numbering is somewhat confusing: Roman numerals indicate the platform number (I to VI), and Arabic numerals (1 to 12) indicate the actual track. Each platform is divided into East and West. Departures and arrivals are indicated on reliable electronic panels, but, beware, they indicate the track number, not the platform! In any case, leaving by train is mostly recommended if you want to travel overnight to destinations on the Black Sea, since trains for Varna and Burgas will leave late in the evening and get you there in the early morning (a couchette to Varna is 16 leva).
The rail travel and ticketing in Bulgaria is unique. If buying round trip ticket you have to obtain a second stamp on your ticket at the cashier before boarding the train on the return journey. Otherwise you will have to pay a fine to the conductor or be kicked off the train to get the stamp.
For example during our visit in April 2013 we bought round trip tickets at the Sofia train station to visit Plovdiv. The cashier stamped the ticket in Sofia and explained this was a round trip ticket (Sofia-Plovdiv-Sofia) at 14.40 Lev per person. Unfortunately after we boarded the return train, the conductor informed us we failed to obtain a stamp in Plovdiv to return to Sofia (even though the ticket was stamped in Sofia where it was purchased) and had to pay a fine of 14 Lev per person or exit at the next station
Access to Bulgaria's Capital is via several entry points:
1. From the North &amp; South via E79/A6  
2. From the East - via Thrace Highway E80/A1-A3  or from the old road paralelling the E80 Highway - Zlatitza - Pirdop - Pazardzhik route.
3. From the West - via A1/E80 Liking the city and the Bulgarian-Serbian Border point of Kalotina.
Otherwise coming from Greece the road E79/A6  is in very good shape, so the 300 km from Thessaloniki are done fairly fast if you don't happen to fall into Friday/Sunday traffic jams in the area of Sofia or Pernik.
Coming from the Republic of Macedonia, via Kiustendil the roads are relatively good but driving within speed limits would avoid you much hassle caused either by traffic police, or road conditions. From Central Europe you can drive almost the whole length on highways (via Slovenia-Croatia-Serbia or Hungary-Serbia), with only the last 100 km between NiÅ¡ in Southern Serbia and Sofia being heavily trafficked mountain roads around the Nishava ravine in not the best shape.
Sofia has a well-developed and efficient public transport system (<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.sumc.bg/en/">[11]</a>) that consists of buses, trolleys, trams, subway. The public transport operates from 5AM to about 12AM. Taxis are the only transport option at night.
<br />
<br />
If you are traveling by public transport with a large suitcase or backpack, be sure to buy a separate ticket for your bag/case (larger than 60x40x40 cm) or you might be fined! You don't need an extra ticket for luggage on the metro. The fine for not having a ticket is 20 BGN. If you don't have a ticket for yourself and a big bag that would be 40 BGN...
There are 15 tram lines, 9 trolley lines, 93 bus lines and two metro lines. Some of the buses cover the area outside the city center including neighboring villages. Useful routes are bus #84 from both terminals of the airport to the center; from the train/bus station to Orlov most - bus #213 or #214 or tram #1, #7 and #18 to Vitosha Street and Nedelya Square, #1, #6, #7 to the National Palace of Culture, #18 to Slaveykov square or #6 to Macedonia square.
<br />
The subway (metro) in Sofia has two lines - Red (M1) and Blue (M2). The Red line (Lulin, Obelya) goes through the city center to the southeast (Tsarigradsko shose), where it will eventually connect to the airport. The Blue line goes through the city center as well connecting Nadezhda r.d. (Lomsko shose), Central Train Station with city center ending at Lozentz r.d (James Bourchier). Both lines meet at the Serdika station where one can transfer using a single ticket. One of the main stations in the center of town is called "NDK" or "National Palace of Culture" (ÐÐÐ/ÐÐ°ÑÐ¸Ð¾Ð½Ð°Ð»ÐµÐ½ ÐÐ²Ð¾ÑÐµÑ Ð½Ð° ÐÑÐ»ÑÑÑÐ°ÑÐ° in Bulgarian) - keep in mind that both names refer to the same station.
The ticketing system is simple. The whole city belongs to the same tariff zone, including the suburbs and the neighboring villages, where a public transportation from Sofia goes. The only exceptions are the lines 103 and 66, where tickets are bought from the driver only, and act as an attraction lines.
There are several kinds of tickets and cards in Sofia. The single ride ticket costs 1.00 Lev - 0.50 Euro, and is valid for a single ride, without limitation of time or distance. After buying the ticket, you must stamp it inside the vehicle with the yellow stamp-machines (perforators). Another option for multi-travelling is buying a court of 10 tickets, the principle is the same with the rides. Such court of 10 tickets costs 8 Leva - 4 Euro. Beware that one such court cannot be used by two or more people on the same time, and the 10-th ticket must always be preserved and shown upon request to the ticket inspectors (this is to make sure that you are not using a punched ticket that you found on the bus).
Tickets for the subway are only obtainable from the ticket machines or kiosks inside the stations. The normal tickets for buses or trams are not valid there. Also the ticket for the subway is valid only for 30 minutes after buying it (you cannot buy a few subway tickets in advance to use later)!
If you are planning a stay in Sofia, it is best to rely on single-day-cards. Such card costs 4 Leva - 2 Euros, and is valid for all buses, trams, trolleybuses and the subway. The card is stamped by the kiosk seller so you don't have to worry about stamping it inside the vehicles. It is valid after stamped until the closing time of the transport, so around 23:30 - 00:00. Just find a kiosk where this card is sold, and buy every single morning such a card, and travel as much as you like. The card is valid for a single person only!
For the subway, you can buy an electronic card that costs 1 BGN then charge it with ten trips for the price of 8 BGN. When you return the card, you get your 1 BGN back. This is recommended if you are going to use the metro at least ten times, as you don't have to queue to buy a ticket every time (and it is also 20% cheaper).
Streets have adequate tiled pavements, especially in the city centre. However, they are frequently uneven and potholed, and walking is further made difficult by parked cars, street vendors and cafes. Except for areas in the very centre, pavements rarely have slopes for wheelchair access or designated lanes for bicycle riders. Pedestrian crossings are numerous and are relatively respected by drivers. Use pedestrian underpasses to cross large intersections, though avoid ones in the suburbs as these are usually derelict.
Mini-buses (marshrutki) stop if you just wave a hand and usually are fast way to go somewhere without need to change the car. You pay to the driver when you get on the car. Prices are 1,50 leva (about 0,75 euro). You need to tell the driver if and when you want to get off.
Taxis in Sofia are yellow. Taxis can be caught on the streets or can be ordered by phone, they arrive fast and are reliable. A drive inside Sofia will rarely exceed 10lv and a trip from the airport to the city center between 8 lv and 15 lv. There are many companies offering taxi services, some of them are OK Supertrans taxi (973 2121), â¬1 Taxi, "962-22-26", Yellow Taxi (91119) and Radio CV Taxi (91263) with fares around 0,70 leva (0,35â¬) per kilometer. Please check the phone number and the prices before you board, because there are some taxis trying to imitate the most popular ones, but having outrageous prices (up to 5,90 leva (3,00â¬) per kilometer) on them and usually hang around hotels and tourist spots picking on unsuspecting customers, its the top line for the per km fares and bottom line for time you need to look at. The general rule is that if a taxi driver comes to you and offers you a drive, never accept it because they will try to rip you off.
Renting a car is possible, but not necessarily a good idea if you are not used to driving here. Be prepared for traffic jams and disorganized traffic. Parking is a major problem. To park you can use tickets for parking in the so-called Blue Zone (sinya zona/ÑÐ¸Ð½Ñ Ð·Ð¾Ð½Ð°) and Green Zone (zelena zona/Ð·ÐµÐ»ÐµÐ½Ð° Ð·Ð¾Ð½Ð°). These tickets can be purchased from the people wearing bright green jackets, hanging around the parking lots. The tickets should be clearly marked with pen and placed on the dashboard so they are clearly visible. The price is 2 leva per 1 hour for the Blue Zone and 1 lev per hour for the Green Zone. The easier and more convenient way is to text the vehicle registration number from a Bulgarian mobile phone to "1302" - Blue Zone and "1303" - Green Zone. Five minutes before the prepaid time is up you will receive a warning SMS. You can either send another message for another hour or move your car. Zone parking is valid Mon - Fri 8AM-7PM, Sat 8AM - 2PM.
Pay attention to this traffic rule: "If a tram, bus, or trolley stops and is on the left side of your car you must stop in your lane and behind it, ie. public transportation vehicle should be on your left side and in front of your car." It is because tram rails are in the middle of the road and tram station is on the pavement so passengers will exit the right side of the vehicle into the road. Even buses have bus stops in the middle of a road.
Sofia is one of the greenest capitals in Europe, with the big park zones ideal for biking. Slow traffic in downtown is perfect for cycling. On a bike you will save time and will enjoy sport activity. Sofia also has the few bike paths around the downtown area and districts such as Mladost, Nadezhda, Hipodruma. Rent a bike (<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.sofiabike.com/">[12]</a>)  Bike rental operates from 10AM to about 8PM (April to November). Discover Sofia by bike map or joint to an experienced bike guide.
Sofia is one of the oldest cities in Europe with ruins spread across the city center. It was founded because of the quality of its mineral waters. In the city alone there are 7 independent <b>mineral water springs</b>. One of the springs is in the central area of the city and is accessible for everybody - cross the square behind the mosque, next to TSUM (the intersection of Iskar and Ekzarh Yosif streets).
In the administrative center of Sofia the streets are covered with a specific yellow pavement. It was laid in the beginning of the 20th century and were a present to the Bulgarian Tsar Ferdinand for his wedding from the Austria-Hungarian royal family.
<br />
<br />
<b>The National Palace of Culture</b> regularly hosts various events, exhibitions and fairs. Check its portal at NDK.bg <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://ndk.bg/program">[54]</a>
The currency in Bulgaria is the Lev, plural Leva. You will also see the abbreviation lv. (Ð»Ð².) or the ISO code - BGN. 
The currency exchange rate is fixed at 1 EUR = 1.95583 BGN. Exchange rate to USD is not fixed directly, but published by the Bulgarian National Bank <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.bnb.bg/bnb/home.nsf/fswebindex?openframeset">[55]</a> and is used for a benchmark in the exchange offices and banks.
Currency exchange offices and most banks offer a buy rate of 1.95 BGN and a sell rate of 1.96 BGN to 1 EUR.  However, at the airport and train station the rates may differ substantially. During business days, it is strongly advisable to use banks for exchanging money. Although there are some really good exchange stalls giving you up to 1.955BGN/EUR, be aware of those who switch the digits giving you 1.59BGN/EUR. It's also possible to change money 24/7 in casinos where rate is good, but you are required to play even some. ATMs on all major credit card issuers (Visa, Mastercard, Amex, Diner's, etc.) are widely available, although you have to watch for your daily withdrawal limit imposed by your card-issuing bank. 
Credit cards are widely accepted, but in small souvenir stores or restaurants; you will definitely need to carry some cash.
<b>Souvenirs</b> can be bought many small shops in the subways in front of the old Party House and in the metro station at the Largo. The Ethnographic Museum has a small shop tightly crammed with souvenirs of all kinds from all over Bulgaria (on the right, just as you enter the main entrance). Antiques and souvenirs can also be found in Alexander Nevski square, in stalls just opposite the church.
You can easily find take away food in Sofia. For less than 2 leva you can get a slice of pizza, a hot-dog or a sandwich. You can get more traditional Bulgarian food in bakeries, offering banitsa  and other kinds of pastry. This food is often consumed with ayran  or boza . Another possibility is to get a katma, which is a big pancake filled with cheese, ham, jelly or chocolate.
Pizzeria-type restaurants and snack bars can be found all over Sofia. Although many are very uninteresting for the traveler looking for a meal with a local flavor, some include excellent Bulgarian dishes.
The soup-trend in Sofia started in 2009 and suddenly everyone was into it. The soup-places usually have daily menu of 4-5 different soups, nice interior and reasonable prices. These places are popular for a luncheon during the working days but there are also a few soup-restaurants that stay open 24/7 and are great for party people to have something to eat in the morning after the long night out.
<br />
Many cafeterias and bars are located on Vitosha Street. Most of them are open air places with cozy atmosphere and are very popular in summer. Due to some noise regulations all bars and restaurants in the city center have to close their gardens after 10 pm and guests are encouraged to move indoors. Fines are serious and neighbours would call the police to complain of the noise, so do not be surprised if a waiter or waitress tells you that they are closing the bar at 10 pm, normally they mean that just the garden is closing. This is another reason why sometimes bartenders may refuse to give you a drink if you want to drink it outside the bar.
<br />
The largest discos in Sofia are concentrated in Students' town (Studentski grad) in the southern part of the city and can be reached by buses #94 (from Sofia university and Culture palace), #280 (from Sofia University, Orlov most) and #102. The last bus to Studentski grad departs from the city center at about 11.30 PM  (from Sofia University and Culture Palace).  The entrance fee for most discos is between 1 and 5 leva (â¬0.5 - 2.5). Discos that can be visited there include: Jim Beam, Plazza, Maskata, Stroezha.
It is a good idea to book your hotel/hostel from websites such as booking.com. Here some suggestions for good hotels. The majority of hotels in Sofia have ver high standards so it doesn't matter much where you go, as long as it is situated in safe and secure area.
If you have a car, you are recommended to park it in a paid guarded lot. Parking in the center is difficult; although you can find free spaces, the Bulgarian police tends to behave harshly towards foreign license plates. Even though the other cars appear to be parked legitimately, double check that there are no signs or pavement markings prohibiting it. If you drive out of the city (or enter the country by road) you must have a vignette (Ð²Ð¸Ð½ÐµÑÐºÐ°) on every high-way. Buy it right away at the border (even though no one will tell you to and there may not be signs) or before leaving Sofia(rental car) from any fuel station. The price (2011) is 10 leva for one week - this is the shortest period available, also one-month and one-year vignettes are available. You must place it on the front window, in the bottom right corner. The fine, if you forget the vignette, is about 200 leva.
Car lights are compulsory at all times.
Pedestrians should be careful since Bulgarian drivers do not yield right of way to those on foot. In the recent years the majority of the cars stop at pedestrian crossings, however not always, so keep this in mind! Since 2011, however, the situation in Sofia is getting better, as the fines for not stopping at crosswalks rised, resulting in more and more cars stopping for passers-by.
Generally at night, you should avoid the area around the Bus and Train Station, Maria Luiza Blvd, the Parks (around the Palace of Culture and Borisova) and the Lions' Bridge (Lavov Most). This is especially true for single women and girls. Junkies get high there, prostitutes (both female and transsexual) offer their "services", some people might want to tempt you with touts of contraband (stolen, illegal, etc.) and/or then try to mug you. These areas are also frequented with the homeless and the drunk. If your hotel is in the area you'll be alright, just don't hang around it unnecessarily. Try to act like you are familiar with the area (and farmiliarize yourself during the day) and look like a local. As long as you avoid the poorly lit areas, the centre is okay, stick to the well-lit areas such as Vitoshka, the Largo, the Sheraton hotel, the Ivan Vazov theater and Voennia Klub (Military Club). It is wise to choose a hotel/hostel in a better location, such as the ones listed above.
Do not get into conflict with locals especially if they seem aggressive or drunk. Avoid football fan groups, they tend to be drunk and aggressive. Avoid wearing football shirts or scarves of the Sofia-based football teams, especially on match days.
On top of it all there are strong allegations of deep-rooted corruption in the Bulgarian justice system. Foreigners may find themselves in serious difficulty if they get into any legal trouble.
There are many other reports of violence on foreigners in Sofia, although all of them were 'aggravated' cases such as a person trying to illegally buy documents or drugs.
Be careful with taxis, make sure you check the prices first before you get in (the fare is per kilometer and it should be something like 0.79 during the day and 0.90 during the night, avoid cabs that display their fare as above 1.20), also make sure the cab has the driver's card on the front with his name. If arriving at the Sofia International Airport - Terminal 2 or 1 - and you need a taxi, order it only from the stands inside the Arrivals zone - there are two stands, one for OK Supertrans and one for 91280 Taxi companies, with people who will escort you to your ordered taxi. Do not pay attention to all taxi drivers standing near the exits, offering "Taxi to the city centre" (Taksi do Centara), as they will rip you off with the bill, which could come more expensive than the flight to Sofia! Just ignore them and go straight to the taxi stands inside the Arrivals Hall. A normal trip to the city centre will cost you around 5 Euro - 10 Leva, or a trip to the Central Train Station will cost you around 8-10 Euros - 16 - 20 Leva. Also never stop one of the cruising around the terminals taxis - they all are overpriced!
If you want to use the public transportation from/to the airport or anywhere in Sofia, be aware that in Sofia tha luggage is charged with a single ride ticket after exceeding a specific size! The size, which is carried free of charge, is 60x40x40 cm, all luggage exceeding it must be charged with additional ticket! The fine for missing, invalid or lost ticket is 20 Leva - 10 Euros! Be very careful with the ticket inspectors at the airport, as they tend to try getting a fine of 20 Euro from the tourists and thus ripping you off with 10 Euro! Tickets can be bought at kiosks or by the bus drivers, however be aware that the most kiosks close at 16:00 and many drivers have already sold their tickets by this time as well. The best way to buy the tickets are the ticket offices, you will find a full list <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.sofiatraffic.bg/en/transport/tarifa-i-prevozni-dokumenti/42/biura-za-izdavane-zarezhdane-i">here</a>. At the airport tickets are best to buy from the small supermarket on the right side inside the Arrivals Hall, you will see the sign "Tickets" pointing to it. Beware, however, that not all ticket sellers speak English, so in doubt you could ask a local to help you - the majority of the youngsters speak freely English and are helpful.
Also, be wary of money exchange shops. Some of them exchange money for generally lower rates than displayed on the exchange rate panel. Go to banks, otherwise you can easily become a victim and if you want your money back the security guard might intimidate you, rough you up or physically abuse you. One such change shop is on Maria Louisa as you walk towards the Lion's bridge (ÐÑÐ²Ð¾Ð² Ð¼Ð¾ÑÑ) just after Halite (Ð¥Ð°Ð»Ð¸ÑÐµ) and Ekzarh Yosif street (you'll recognise it by the misspelling of currency, spelled 'currensy'). If possible, try exchanging money also in the exchange bureaus at the large shopping centers when available - one good example is Tavex Exchange Shop at The Mall shopping centre. Never exchange currency on the street!
Sofia has a major problem with the homeless dogs. Although the majority don't disturb passers-by, there are recently some cases of attacked people in certain neighborhoods. It is best to avoid sidewalks near abandoned buildings or dark alleys in the parks as it is sure there will be homeless dogs to find. In the unlikely event of getting attacked or bitten, call immediately 112 and visit the nearby hospital, as these dogs could carry diseases.
It is also wise to avoid crossing certain underpasses during the night - especially be very careful with the underpasses near the Central Train Station, near the Opalchenska Subway station, all underpasses along Bulgaria Blvd. At best don't use them at all, and cross the street at a place, where many people are to find.
When visiting a night club or disco be very careful with the crowd. It is wise to avoid the Pop-folk discos, the majority of which are in Student's Town, as the visitors there tend to become very aggressive when getting drunk, thus resulting in starting a fight. Visit the discos in the City Center, which are a bit more expensive, but play decent music and are safe to visit. In case of a fight, never get involved, stay away or signal to the police.
Sofia has a large number of mostly free wireless hotspots in bars, restaurants, and cafÃ©s. You may find also in hotels and public areas, like "Park Zaimov". The airport has a free public wireless hotspot for use in Terminal 2. So does the entire central train station in Sofia.
