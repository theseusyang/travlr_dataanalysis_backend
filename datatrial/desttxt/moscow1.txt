<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.moscow-city.ru">Moscow</a> (<a href="/en/Russian_phrasebook" title="Russian phrasebook">Russian</a>: <i>ÐœÐ¾Ñ ÐºÐ²Ð°</i>) is the 860 year-old capital of the <a href="/en/Russia" title="Russia">Russian Federation</a>. A truly iconic, global city, Moscow has played a central role in the development of the Russian state and indeed the world. For many, the sight of the Kremlin complex in the centre of the city is still loaded with symbolism and history - Moscow was the capital of the former <a href="/en/Soviet_Union" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> and signs of its previous life are very visible even now. Yet, there's more to Russia and its capital than just memories of the USSR. Architectural gems from the time of the Russian Empire are still dotted throughout Moscow, whilst signs of modern Tsars (or at least people with similar levels of wealth) abound.
Moscow is the financial and political centre of Russia and the former Soviet Union, with a population of around 13 million, and covers an area of around 1,080 kmÂ². One-tenth of all Russian citizens live in the metropolitan area. Moscow is in GMT+4 time zone.
For many years since the break up of the Soviet Union, the economy has improved, and the modern era has brought upon a wide variety of construction projects, modern architecture and quasi-modern transport systems.
Moscow's long time mayor, Yury Luzhkov initiated these changes during his time in office, but was fired in September 2010 for allegedly insulting the president through a scathing letter.
His successor, Sergei Sobyanin, has begun to gradually relax Luzhkov's construction plan, and a majority of Luzhkov's plans have been stopped or abandoned.
Moscow is a large metropolis on the Moskva River, which bends its way through the city. Most of the main sites are on the northern bank of the river. The other major waterway is the Yauza River, which flows into the Moskva east of the Kremlin.
<br />
Much of Moscow's geography is defined by the numerous 'Ring Roads' that circle the city at various distances from the centre, roughly following the outline of the walls that used to surround Moscow. With Red Square and the Kremlin forming the very centre, the innermost ring road is the Boulevard Ring (<i>Bulvarnoye Koltso</i>), built in the 1820s where the 16th century walls used to be. It runs from the Christ the Savior Cathedral in south-west central Moscow, to the mouth of the Yauza in south-east central Moscow.
The next ring road, the Garden Ring (<i>Sadovoe Koltso</i>), derives its name from the fact that landowners near the road in Tsarist times were obligated to maintain gardens to make the road attractive. In Soviet times, the road was widened, and currently you will find no gardens there.
The recently constructed Third Ring is not much use for tourists but is a heavily used motorway which absorbs a bit of Moscow's traffic. It roughly follows the outline of <i>Kamer-Kollezhsky val</i>, the customs and passport boundary of Moscow between 1742 and 1852. The outer edge of Moscow is largely defined by the Moscow Ring Road (widely known by its abbreviation: MKAD-Moskovskaya koltsevaya avtomobilnaya doroga), a motorway which is 108 km long and encircles the entire city (similar to London's M25 and Paris' <i>PÃ©riphÃ©rique</i>). A Fourth Ring was planned to be built between the Third Ring and the Moscow Ring Road, using in places the right-of-way of the freight rail loop, but the new mayor's administration announced the project was abandoned.
If you need a visa to go to Russia, Moscow is no exception; there's no specific Moscow visa - once you have a valid Russian visa, you can go to Moscow as well as any other place in Russia. See <a href="/en/Russia#Get_in" title="Russia">Russia#Get in</a> for details.
Moscow (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IATA" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:IATA">IATA</a>: <b>MOW</b>) has three main airports:
If you are a Gazprom functionary or a business traveller with a private jet, you may also find yourself landing in <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://ostafyevo-airport.com/"><b>Ostafyevo Airport</b></a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICAO" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:ICAO">ICAO</a>: <b>UUMO</b>).
Moscow is by far the main air traffic hub of Russia and will continue to be as both Sheremetyevo and Vnukovo are undergoing major development plans.
During the years 1980-1991 all international flights to Moscow landed at Sheremetyevo International Airport, commonly called Sheremetyevo II, which was recently renamed "Terminal F". The home base of Aeroflot's international services, Sheremetyevo II was built for the 1980 Summer Olympics. Sheremetyevo I (now "Terminal B") was built in 1960s as the then's international terminal, but after 1980 was "downgraded" to domestic service. Today Sheremetyevo also has four new terminals - A (business aviation), C, D and E. Aeroflot operates in terminals D, E and F.
In mid-2000s, Sheremetyevo was eclipsed by Domodedovo, which underwent a renovation and has always had a direct commuter rail link to the city. Many international carriers, including British Airways and Lufthansa, switched to Domodedovo and since 2005 it has catered to more passengers than Sheremetyevo. Aeroflot's biggest competitors S7 (Sibir) and Transaero, along with a slew of minnows, are based at Domodedovo.
In the last years, the third airport, Vnukovo, has launched a major reconstruction project as well and has managed to attract a number of airlines including Turkish Airlines and Lufthansa. UTAir, a major domestic airline, has operated its network from Vnukovo for decades.
If you prefer to go to the airport by car, it is best to call a taxi agency and book a cab. There are many agencies that can provide this service, and the cost ranges from â‚¬30-50 or more. Be sure to check the list of official taxi operators on the official websites of airports. <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.domodedovo.ru/en/main/getting/taxi/">[1]</a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://svo.aero/en/transport/#taxi">[2]</a>. With telephone or online pre-booking you will be able to get a taxi for a cheaper price. All airports also have taxi kiosks where you can get yourself a driver at a fixed price, but a bit higher than if you book taxi online or by phone in advance. Don't listen to people jumping at you in the terminal as soon as you clear customs with offers of a taxi in several languages - at best it will get you a major rip-off, and may be unsafe to boot. For public transportation see below:
<b>Sheremetyevo International Airport</b>, (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IATA" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:IATA">IATA</a>: <b>SVO</b>) <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.svo.aero/en/">[3]</a> has terminals A (business aviation), B, C, D, E and F on both sides of the runway  <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.svo.aero/en/map/">[4]</a>. You can walk between terminals A, B and C; or between terminals D, E and F; but you have to take a shuttle bus <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.svo.aero/en/between-terminals/">[5]</a> or a taxi to go between the two sites. Sheremetyevo I is the old name for Terminal B, and Sheremetyevo II is the old name for Terminal F.
International flights depart terminals C, D, E and F. Domestic destinations are operated out of terminals B and D. Aeroflot has concentrated most of its flights to the newly built Terminal D (was known during the construction time as "Terminal 3" or "Sheremetyevo III"), though some flights are operated from E and F.
Sheremetyevo, north of the city centre, is about as close to downtown Moscow as Vnukovo, but the major road leading to it, Leningradskoye Shosse, is one of the busiest in the city and is normally a giant traffic jam most of the day.
The quickest way to get to Sheremetyevo is to take an <i>Aeroexpress</i> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.aeroexpress.ru/en/">[6]</a> train from Belorussky Railway Terminal (see below). These depart from a dedicated terminal (3d or 4th entrances) from 5:50AM to 11:30PM every 30 or 60 minutes (check their website before you go, there is a 2-hr "window" in the schedule between 11am and 1pm from the city terminal, and from 10:30am to 12:30pm from Sheremetyevo), and now connect directly to SVO-2/D/E/F, with a shuttle bus service to SVO-1/B/C. The journey takes 35 minutes and costs 320 rubles one-way (as of June 2013). Keep your paper or mobile ticket for the whole of the Aeroexpress journey. In contrast to many other airports, Sheremetyevo isn't served by a mixture of express and suburban trains, and the Aeroexpress is the only rail link to it.
If you are not in a hurry (particularly if you are going from the airport to the city), you can get to the airport by local transport. Bus 851 departs from Rechnoy Vokzal subway station (North of the green line), bus 817 departs from Planernaya (North of the purple line). The station in the airport is near the exit of terminals E, F. The cost is equal to the cost of a normal bus journey inside the city (single-ride tickets cost 25 RUB at the vendor kiosks, 28 RUB from the driver). Mind that the buses might be stuck in a traffic jam.
For leaving a car near the airport for the length of your trip outside Moscow, there are numerous (non)official parking lots between SVO1 and SVO2; rates start from 200 rubles/day and up.
Most flights from/to Sheremetyevo II are operated either by Aeroflot or by its partner international carriers, mostly members of the SkyTeam alliance. Check-in starts two hours before departure time (three hours for U.S.-bound flights).
If you fly economy and there are several people in your group, for check-in it's better to have someone to stand in business class queue, especially if you arrive before registration starts: business-class clerk opens first and may take on economy class passengers if there's none (or at least not too many) business-class customers.
Ground-floor is the arrivals level, with departures being one level above.
Driving in to Sheremetyevo II area (going behind toll bar) is hugely overpriced and should be avoided whenever possible. In addition to entry charge of 100 rubles/hour (rounded up to the next hour), after entering the toll bar, there is an extra charge taken, from 100 rubles/hour to 300 rubles/hour, depending on the distance from entrance and the comfort of parkingâ€”with an unofficial option of an unlimited-time stay for 300 rubles.
In the pre-check-in area on the departures level, there's only TGI Friday plus six to eight no-name cafes/bars/coffee shops. TGIF can make your coffee to go, but charges about 360 rubles for mid-sized latte and serves it in Coca-Cola-branded paper cups. They also have free Wi-Fi which can be used outside of the restaurant as well. The TGIF serves the same menu as in America, which may come in handy on your way out if you have grown tired of salty smoked fish and warm drinks. There's a cheap self-service cafeteria two levels up (use the elevator or the stairs), where all the airport workers eat, and a more formal 1980's Soviet-retro-chic restaurant above it. Both have nice view of the tarmac.
Most cafes and restaurants beyond passport control are faceless and overpriced. Club Bar boasts Ronnefeldt teas and decent pancakes however. Note that you have to clear customs before check-in so there's practically no going back after you check-in to the cafeteria or the restaurant upstairs.
The airport has banking and currency exchange offices, and ATMs are available in both the arrivals and departures areas. Remember to change your rubles into Euros or USD before departing Moscow, as almost no other country will cash in your rubles for you. Duty-free shops operated by Aerofirst Moscow Duty Free <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.dutyfree.ru/default.aspx?lang=en">[7]</a> cover a large space, but merely repeat the same choice in five or six outlets. As elsewhere, only the most popular local souvenirs are sold, still with a huge margin. This terminal also has a hairdresser, pharmacy and a medical office as well as at least two travel agencies. Business and first class lounges are in upstairs.
For transit passengers <b>without a Russian visa</b> a possibility exists to stay the night at Novotel hotel just outside the airport. Report to the 'Transfer/Transit without visa' desk upon arrival. You'll be escorted to the hotel in a private bus and stay in a corridor with personal security guard. Rooms are spacious (two queen size beds) and comfortable. You'll be picked up by Aeroflot staff about one hour prior to departure and the bus will bring you directly to the departure gate. Cost of this service is around RUB 6700 for a room.
The information desk is in the main hall and sometimes you are lucky enough to get someone who speaks reasonably good English. The number is +7 495 956-4666.  You can also call an Intourist representatives (available in Terminal 2) who can provide tourist information at +7 495 578-5971.
<b>Domodedovo International Airport</b> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IATA" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:IATA">IATA</a>: <b>DME</b>) <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://domodedovo.ru/en/">[8]</a> is south of the city center and is the main hub of S7 Airlines and Transaero, large domestic airlines in Russia also serving numerous international destinations. Many international carriers, including British Airways, Lufthansa and budget airline easyJet, also use Domodedovo and since 2005 it has catered to more passengers than Sheremetyevo.
The railway station is located directly inside the airport and is served by the non-stop <i>Aeroexpress</i> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.aeroexpress.ru/en/domodedovo.html">[9]</a> train as well as commuter trains, both running to the Paveletsky Rail Terminal in central Moscow. The Aeroexpress runs every 30 minutes and takes 45-50 minutes to the centre and costs 320 rubles, whereas the commuter train runs 10-11 times/day, takes 65-70 minutes and costs 99 rubles.
A shuttle bus runs from the Metro station at Domodedovskaya to the airport every 15 minutes, taking around 30 minutes for the trip and costing 100 rubles.  The bus is actually a very comfortable coach service with plenty of luggage space (luggage is included in the price).  Domodedovskaya is around 20 minutes from Paveletsky, and if you are getting the metro at the end of your trip it may work out a simpler and cheaper journey than the Aeroexpress.  The shuttle bus is numbered 308, and departs from the bus parking on the left around 30 metres in front of the terminal building.  At Domodedovskaya take the exit to the south (downtown side) turn right in the underpass, and follow it to the end, then take the stairs.  There are crude stencilled signs on the pillars to guide you.  The bus stop is immediately at the top of the stairs.
<b>Vnukovo International Airport</b> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IATA" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:IATA">IATA</a>: <b>VKO</b>) <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.vnukovo.ru/eng/insex.wbp">[10]</a> is southwest from the city centre and is served by such airlines as UTair, Transaero, Yakutia, Lufthansa, Germanwings etc. The new Terminal A was opened in December 2010 and offers both domestic and international flights. Terminal D is used for domestic arrivals from North Caucasus only. You can take an <i>Aeroexpress</i> train <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.aeroexpress.ru/en/schedule/vnukovo/">[11]</a> from Kievsky Train Station, which departs 07:00-24:00 every 60 minutes in peak hours (with intervals of about four hours for off-peak hours). The journey takes 35-45 minutes and costs 320 rubles one way. There is an express bus connection between Domodedovo and Vnukovo airports, which departs about every 90 minutes. 
Another convenient and fast way to get to Vnukovo is the local transport. Take the subway to Yugo-Zapadnaya station (the last one on the red line). 
Then you can take the small mini-busses next to the exit of the subway. These mini-busses depart every ~10 minutes, and the journey doesn't take more than 30 minutes since the road is usually not heavily congested. This way it costs 25RUB for the subway and 50 RUB for the bus. A little bit unconfortable if you travel with many or big luggages.
<b>Ostafyevo International Airport</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://ostafyevo-airport.com/">[12]</a> is located south from Moscow in Podolsk district, about 3 km to the west of Scherbinka railway station, from where you need to take a taxi, and is the home of GazpromAvia airlines. It caters mainly to business aviation.
Moscow is the principal railway hub of Russia, from here you can reach almost all corners of this vast country and far into <a href="/en/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a> or <a href="/en/Asia" title="Asia">Asia</a>. A side-effect of this is that it's often easier for a someone going cross-country to change trains in Moscow, even if it's a little out of the way, as the choice of direct trains is limited compared to the ones going to the capital. This means, unfortunately, that main train stations are always crowded with transients, and are generally about the most unsafe places in the city.
This said, and even with proliferation of large and small air carriers in the post-Soviet Russia and the price of plane tickets coming down considerably (and the price of rail tickets creeping up year after year), train travel still remains the predominant mode of middle- and even long-distance transportation for the majority of Russians. In a day and a night a traveler based in Moscow can cover a significant part of the Eastern Europe; two nights and the intervening day will find you the second morning as far south as the Black Sea and as far East as Ural Mountains.
Most long-distance trains are operated by <b>FPK</b> (Federal Passenger Company, a subsidiary of Russian Railways <b>RZD</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.rzd.ru">[13]</a>), tickets can be bought both at stations and on-line if you can read Russian. Notice that tickets bought on-line still needs to be validated at a counter or a ticket machine. At the major stations there are often counters with English-speaking personnel.  Sometimes these are marked, and sometimes you will be directed by the first person you speak to another counter with an English speaker.
<b>From Saint Petersburg</b>
With the launch of high-speed <i>Sapsan</i> trains <a href="/en/Saint_Petersburg" title="Saint Petersburg">Saint Petersburg</a> is now just four hours away. There are seven depatures daily at 6:45AM, 7AM, 1:30PM, 1:45PM, 3PM, 7:25PM, and 7:45PM, with some trains stopping at <a href="/en/Tver" title="Tver">Tver</a>, Vyshniy Volochek, Bologoe, and Okulovka. Fares vary but usually land somewhere around 3,000 rubles.
Overnight trains are still very popular however and there are plenty of them, 13 in total, not taking in account those passing in transit. The most famous is the <i>Red Arrow</i> (ÐšÑ€Ð°Ñ Ð½Ð°Ñ Ñ Ñ‚Ñ€ÐµÐ»Ð°), departing Saint Petersburg daily at 11:55PM while the song Hymn to the Great City plays.
<b>From Europe</b>
The newly-launched <i>TransEuropeanExpress</i> traverses Europe, making the run <a href="/en/Paris" title="Paris">Paris</a>-Moscow up to four times a week via <a href="/en/Frankfurt" title="Frankfurt">Frankfurt</a>, <a href="/en/Berlin" title="Berlin">Berlin</a> and <a href="/en/Warsaw" title="Warsaw">Warsaw</a> amongst other cities. The train boasts a luxury carriage apart from the normal first and second class and national railways provide restaurant cars. Travel from Paris takes 38 hours, fares are quite high with second class tickets at â‚¬330.
Several other European cities have direct carriages to Moscow including; <a href="/en/Amsterdam" title="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a> (36 h), <a href="/en/Basel" title="Basel">Basel</a> (38 h), <a href="/en/Bratislava" title="Bratislava">Bratislava</a> (42 h), <a href="/en/Budapest" title="Budapest">Budapest</a> (37 h), <a href="/en/Nice" title="Nice">Nice</a> (49 h, Thursdays) <a href="/en/Prague" title="Prague">Prague</a> (34 h) and <a href="/en/Vienna" title="Vienna">Vienna</a> (34 h). The Amsterdam carriage was discontinued in December 2012. See seat61.com for details.
<b>From Eastern Russia and Asia</b>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<i>See also: <a href="/en/Trans-Siberian_Railway" title="Trans-Siberian Railway">Trans-Siberian Railway</a></i><br />
Moscow lies at the western end of several great train journeys across the Trans-Siberian Railway, the main line runs between Moscow and <a href="/en/Vladivostok" title="Vladivostok">Vladivostok</a>, the principal Russian city along the Pacific Coast. Branded train <i>Rossiya</i> runs every second day and takes seven nights. Stop-overs are made in many important cities in eastern and central Russia including <a href="/en/Irkutsk" title="Irkutsk">Irkutsk</a>, <a href="/en/Krasnoyarsk" title="Krasnoyarsk">Krasnoyarsk</a>, <a href="/en/Novosibirsk" title="Novosibirsk">Novosibirsk</a>, <a href="/en/Omsk" title="Omsk">Omsk</a> and <a href="/en/Yekaterinburg" title="Yekaterinburg">Yekaterinburg</a>. Additional trains are of course available from these cities too. Prices hover around 20,000 rubles for second class.
More common to travellers is the other route, between Moscow and China. There are two weekly trains from <a href="/en/Beijing" title="Beijing">Beijing</a>, the <i>Trans-Mongolian</i> via <a href="/en/Ulaanbaatar" title="Ulaanbaatar">Ulaanbaatar</a> and <i>Vostok</i> via <a href="/en/Manchuria" title="Manchuria" class="mw-redirect">Manchuria</a>. Both journeys take six nights but the one via <a href="/en/Mongolia" title="Mongolia">Mongolia</a> offers more scenery. Tickets for this route can not be bought on-line and travel agencies often pre-book whole compartments and then re-sell them. This means that unless you're lucky and can buy a ticket early you have to book though an travel agency which can be expensive, up to $800 for a one-way ride.
<b>Train stations in Moscow</b>
Moscow has nine train stations, eight of them offering long-distance and local train services (Savyolovsky Station offers local train service only). All are located relatively in the center of Moscow and have metro stations nearby. Be prepared for enormous queues trying to enter or exit the Metro at peak times, as people are getting off or on the commuter trains.
Three of them; <i>Leningradsky</i>, <i>Yaroslavsky</i> and <i>Kazansky</i> are all located on one huge square, informally known as the "Three Stations' Square". A running joke among Moscow taxi drivers ever since the Soviet times is to be able to pick up a fare from one of them to the other, taking the unwary tourist on an elaborate ride in circles.
The direct way to drive from <a href="/en/Germany" title="Germany">Germany</a>, <a href="/en/Poland" title="Poland">Poland</a>, or <a href="/en/Belarus" title="Belarus">Belarus</a> is along the E30 road. However EU or American citizens have to get Belarussian visas to pass through Belarus, so it could be more convenient to go via Latvia (the nearest border crossing between EU and Russia on this direction) using the E22 which starts in <a href="/en/Riga" title="Riga">Riga</a>.
Easy access from <a href="/en/Finland" title="Finland">Finland</a> through <a href="/en/Saint_Petersburg" title="Saint Petersburg">Saint Petersburg</a> and <a href="/en/Novgorod" title="Novgorod">Novgorod</a> is along the E18 road. This route is also known as Russian Federal Highway M-10. Traffic on the M-10 is heavy and driving less relaxing.
Foreign cars &#8211; especially expensive ones &#8211; <i>might</i> attract unwelcome attention, and there is cumbersome paperwork involved.
Many entry points to Moscow - that is, the overpasses carrying the major highways over the Ring Road and into the city - feature rotating roadblocks, where teams of traffic police may stop a vehicle. especially if it is not featuring Moscow plates. You may be stopped and questioned; you'll be allowed to proceed if you have all the proper documents.
Intercity buses to Russian and some former Soviet Union cities depart from the intercity bus station (Ð°Ð²Ñ‚Ð¾Ð²Ð¾ÐºÐ·Ð°Ð») at Shelkovskaya Metro station (the last station of the dark blue line, in northeast Moscow). This is the only place in Moscow from which public transportation is available directly to <a href="/en/Suzdal" title="Suzdal">Suzdal</a>. Also, some intercity buses depart from Komsomolskaya, Tushinskaya, Yugo-Zapadnaya, Vykhino, and Domodedovskaya Metro stations.
Moscow used to be served by regular passenger ships. A system of navigable channels and locks connects the Moskva River with Volga River, which in turn, through the Volga-Baltic channel, provides a way to the <a href="/en/Baltic_Sea" title="Baltic Sea" class="mw-redirect">Baltic Sea</a> (using the Onega, Ladoga and Neva rivers) and further from Ladoga Lake through the White Sea channel to the White Sea; to the south through the Volga-Don channel to the Don river and the Azov and Black Sea; while Volga itself flows into the Caspian Sea. In the Soviet times this allowed the official propaganda to refer to Moscow as "a port on the five seas". There is no scheduled passenger traffic anymore on any of these routes.
There are 2 river terminals in Moscow, on each end of the series of major bridges over the river; these are not capable of being drawn up, and not all of them are of sufficient height to allow large ships to pass. The North Station, in Khimki neighborhood, provides berths for cruise ships to Saint Petersburg, as well as Astrakhan, Rostov-on-Don and other cities along the Volga. The South Station (closest Metro: Kolomenskaya) ceased to be used commercially, since the Oka River, of which the Moskva is a tributary, has silted to the point of being impassable.
Central Moscow is best to be explored on foot, but as the distances are huge, it's easiest to use the famous <b>Metro</b> system <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://engl.mosmetro.ru/">[14]</a>. It is comprehensive, boasts some great architecture, and is relatively cheap.
Since April 2013, Moscow introduced the new ticket system. There are three types of paper tickets, one of them ("TAT") with magnet stripe could be used only in on-ground transportation (buses, trams and trolleybuses), another ("Ediny") is a samrt-card and could be used in metro as well. These kinds of tickets are of pay-per-ride type. Payment does not depend on the length of the trip. Third type of tickets is "90 minutes ride" tickets, they are also paper smart-cards, but allow one ride in metro and unlimited rides in buses etc. for 90 minutes since first validation. By the way you have not to finish your ride within 90 minutes, you have only to make your ticket last validation. "Ediny" and "90 minutes" tickets are sold at manned booths ("kassa") or ticket vending machines within the stations.  The vending machines at most stations sell one or two trip tickets only. The ticket machines have buttons in English as well as Russian.  A convenient way to avoid queuing is to buy a multi-trip ticket for 5, 10, 20 or 60 trips valid for 90 days, or a monthly pass for up to 70 trips; the latter costs almost the same as 60x pass, but is valid for a calendar month, <i>not</i> the 30 days from the date of purchase. One ride with "Ediny" ticket costs 30 RUB, with "90 minutes" costs 50 RUB. The most convinient way to ride all kinds of transportation in Moscow  is "Troika" e-wallet. It's a plastic smart-card which can be refuelled and reimbursed (the deposit is 50 RUB). This e-wallet is smart. First ride on metro will cost 28 RUB, next on-ground ride within 90 minutes will cost only 16 rubles, rest on-ground rides will be free. If you start with on-ground transportation, first ride will cost only 26 RUB, second 18 RUB. Note what you can make only one ride in metro for reduced price within 90 minutes. Transfer from metro to monorail and vice versa is free within 
Details of prices and multiple purchase discounts are on the official website <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://engl.mosmetro.ru/pages/page_0.php?id_page=8">[15]</a>.
24 hours unlimited ticket costs 200 RUB. You can also buy smart-cards for a period from one month up to one year. However, if you lose it, you will not get any refund or replacement.
You can easily find any station you need on the map <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.mosmetro.ru/documents/10871/moscow_metro.pdf">[16]</a>.
Rule of thumb for trip time in Metro is usually to take about 3 minutes for every station you pass.  However, some parts of the metro are very deep, and some transfers are very long.  In the city centre it can save time to go directly to the above-ground entrance of the line you want to take, rather than to enter at a connecting station and transfer underground.  The metro webpage estimates travel times between any pair of stations.  Some escalators are a two minute ride as the stations in the city centre are very deep. On the escalators, stand on the right.
The Metro is open from 5:30 a.m - 1:00 a.m. Station entrances are closed at 1:00 a.m., this is also the time, when last trains start from all of the termini stations of the lines. No one is allowed to start their journey by metro after 1:00 a.m., although trains are still running. Service on the ring line extends for crossing passengers to 1:30 a.m., though entrances are still closed at 1. Short-length escalators and all escalators,  running down, are also locked at 1:00 a.m. (although crossings are not closed while there are trains running) and passengers have to step them. However, long escalators running up work to the last passenger. Before 7:00 a.m. and after 9:00 p.m., the Metro is rarely busy. Between these times on workdays, however, it can be a real squeeze, especially within the ring.
The colors on the signs in the metro don't necessarily correspond to the ones on the maps, so the green line is not necessarily indicated by a green sign (that could be the sign for the gray line).  Use the numbers rather than the colours to avoid any ambiguity.  There are almost <b>no English signs inside</b> so have your itinerary ready beforehand or learn to recognise your station in Cyrillic.  Each metro carriage has a map in latin script, and there is one near the entrance to each platform. Do not intimidated by the huge masses of jostling, rushing, cross people. The Russians also take their time to study the tiny signposts to see where to change trains or which exit to take. To find out in which direction a train is going, look at the signs at the platform or in the <b>front</b> window of the train - the one in the rear window may show the opposite direction. Avoid the Metro if you are claustrophobic since the air is thick, especially at rush hour. Most of the older train cars are not air-conditioned nor heated, so in the winter it might get quite chilly on several stretches where the track is above the ground.
The most interesting stations in terms of decor are <b>Komsomolskaya</b>, <b>Novoslobodskaya</b> and <b>Kievskaya</b> on the ring line, <b>Kropotkinskaya</b> on the red line, <b>Kievskaya</b>, <b>Arbatskaya</b> and <b>Ploschad' Revolyutsii</b> (there are lot of sculptures on sides of this station) on dark blue line, <b>Mayakovskaya</b> on the green line (watch out for the mosaics on the ceiling). The last one is also one of the deepest, which allowed it to be used as a makeshift assembly hall for a Party meeting marking the anniversary of the Revolution during the German bombardments in the winter of 1941.
Pay attention that there are several pairs or even triples of stations with same names located on different lines and connected by transfers. But there are also unique two pair of stations called <b>Smolenskaya</b> and <b>Arbatskaya</b> and they are <b>NOT</b> connected at all. Those on light blue line are among the first built 
stations in Metro (they were opened in 1935 with first Metro line).
Also you can take a look at architecture of ground entrance building of mentioned <b>Arbatskaya</b> station on light blue line (it's built like red star in plan) and <b>Krasnye Vorota</b> station on red line (it's like a giant portal protruding from underground).
Also there is an unique station in Metro that is located at bridge crossing Moscow River. This bridge also carries traffic road on higher level. There is beautiful view through transparent sides of station. This station is called <b>Vorob'evy gory</b> and located on red line. Great observing point around Moscow is located nearby on Vorob'evy hills.
Lomonosov Moscow State University main building is also located next to the
observation point.
The Metro is relatively safe, although pickpockets are a problem, as they are in any environment where a lot of people are pressed together. Opportunistic petty crime, such as snatching someone's mobile phone and jumping out just as the doors are closing, is also commonplace. Take the usual precautions at the night hours, when the crowds recede to avoid being the only passenger in a car with a gang of inebriated teenagers looking for an excuse to beat someone up.
There is no train guard or conductor, so the first car near the driver may be the safest.  Every car is equipped with an intercom to the driver's cabin; they are beige boxes with a grill and a black button near doors, and mostly work, unless visibly vandalized. If you find yourself in a dangerous situation, press the button and wait for the driver or his assistant to reply. The employee might not understand you but will know that there are problems and will pass the information on. At the next stop, someone (it could be even a bored on-duty policeman) might check in on the commotion.
Every large street in the city is served by at least one bus route. Many of these routes are doubled by the trolleybus routes. Also every large street of Moscow has trolley wires over it. Moscow buses and trollebuses go from 5:30 a.m. till 1:00 a.m. The average distance between bus stops is about 150 m (500 ft). <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.anaga.ru/travel/moscowtrans.htm#1">[17]</a>
As Metro stations outside the city centre are far apart in comparison to other cities, up to 4 km (2.5 mi), an extensive bus network radiates from each station to the surrounding residential zones. Even though they have one, buses and trolleybuses usually don't operate on a fixed schedule, mostly due to large Moscow jams, but there are always plenty of them around. Timetable can be observed better in out-of-jam hours, but beware, that in Russia even without any reason, being 5-10 ahead or behind schedule, or completely cancelling some trips at certain times, is common, especially late in the evening. In some directions, the amount of public transport may considerably reduce after 9pm though. Timetable for almost all routes of buses, trolleybuses and trams can be found here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://mosgortrans.org/pass3/">[18]</a> (in Russian), unfortunately this site is rarely updated and often contains out-of-date information (it is largely out-of-date as of September 2011). However it can give a feeling of frequency of various routes at different times of the day.
One trip costs 25 rubles, if you buy yellow "TAT" ticket at the booth at the bus stop. You can buy "TAT" tickets for 5, 11, 20, 40 or 60 rides for reduced price (valid for 90 days since purchase).  At the booth you can also buy and use "90 minutes" ticket (see "Metro" section for details). You can use "Ediny" and "Troika" e-wallet to pay for on-ground ride.   Tickets for bus, trolleybus and tram are unified. The information about the ticket costs is available here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://troika.mos.ru/tariffs/table/">[19]</a>. Note that driver sells only 4-ride "TAT" tickets for 100  RUB (valid 90 days) and green "90 minutes" tickets for 50 RUB. To validate magnet strip ticket (yellow TAT) insert it into validator as shown, to validate smart-card just put it on the validator's mark.
In early 1900s Moscow had an extensive electric tram system, which had firstly been opened in 1899. However as Metro was opened (May 1935) and the trolleybus appeared (November 1934), the tram network was radically reduced and the most of the tram routes became to be served by the trolleybuses. In particular, the B tram route to run around the Garden Ring, was changed by the B-trolleybus-route.
Now tram daily usage by the Muscovites is low (about 5%), although it still remains vital in some districts for those who need to get to the nearby Metro station. Tram fares are same as bus and trolleybus fares.  The tram routes and their time-table: <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.anaga.ru/travel/moscowtrans.htm#2">[20]</a>.
Marshrutka is a jitney-like mode of transport that falls between private transport and conventional buses. You will often find Marshrutka's following the same routes as conventional buses, and will follow the same numbering pattern. The role of the modern Russian marshrutka is basically similar to the minibus in other countries. It is similar to German Sammeltaxis, Mexican Peseros and American dollar vans. Trip costs can be different, depending on marshrutka line. Usually one trip costs 30 rubles. You give money to the driver after entering the minibus. If you need to get off, you have to shout: "ÐžÑ Ñ‚Ð°Ð½Ð¾Ð²Ð¸Ñ‚Ðµ Ð·Ð´ÐµÑ ÑŒ!" (Astanaviti zdes, meaning "Stop here!")<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.anaga.ru/travel/moscowtrans.htm#3">[21]</a>. You should shout it as loudly as possible, because the motor roar and the music sounding from the driverâ€™s audio system muffle the passengers' voices. Sometimes the marsrutkers hang out an inscription: "Ð¢Ð¸ÑˆÐµ Ñ ÐºÐ°Ð¶ÐµÑˆÑŒ â€“ Ð´Ð°Ð»ÑŒÑˆÐµ Ð²Ñ‹Ð¹Ð´ÐµÑˆÑŒ", meaning "If you speak quietly, you'll travel far".
You should shout it in Russian, because generally the Marshrutka drivers speak only Russian, and since many of them came to Russia from Central Asia, they often even speak Russian poorly.
Generally marshrutkas go a little faster than buses: however they may be operated by reckless drivers and thus become dangerous. Unless you're in a hurry, more convenient buses/trolleys/trams are a safer option.
<b>NOTE:</b> Beware of unofficial taxis that like to hang around tourist areas. They use a taxi meter, however their meter goes by some made-up, unofficial rate. A 10 minute ride can easily cost between RUB2500-3000(close to $100), instead of RUB400.
<b>Make sure to negotiate on a fixed price beforehand. Or have your hotel order taxis for you.</b> There are now also a few apps for smartphones that allow you to order official taxis by your GPS location. Yandex Taxi and GetTaxi are popular ones.
<br />
In Russia and Moscow, the difference between hailing a cab and simply hitch-hiking is blurry. It is an old Russian tradition for drivers to offer rides to strangers, for a fee. For many Russians, it is like a second job {such drivers are usually called "Ð±Ð¾Ð¼Ð±Ð¸Ð»Ñ‹" (bombers)}. Generally, wherever you are, at any time of day or night, you can get a 'cab' in a matter of minutes or seconds by holding out your hand. Hold your hand out low by your hip, not up high as they hail cabs in American films.
Normally, you tell the driver where you're going and negotiate an amount with you naming the first price. For many locations, giving the closest Metro stop is the best plan of attack. If you don't like the amount one guy is charging, you'll doubtlessly find another driver in a minute or two. Sometimes when you tell the driver where you're going, he'll decide he's not going in that direction and drive off. Keep in mind, though, that very few drivers will speak English. It is not recommended to get in the car if the driver asks you "Dorogu pokazhesh?", meaning that he doesn't know the way himself (nevertheless it won't stop him from charging you a greater price).
The "bombers" staying near bus stops and subway stations usually charge higher prices than an accidental driver (as it's their job), however they seem to be a bit safer. Picking up and transporting passengers for a fee by non-taxi cabs is illegal in Moscow since April 2012 (however, it's the driver that gets nicked).
You should be able to get between most destinations within the Garden Ring for 200 rubles or less, unless it is a national holiday or when the metro is not working. For example, a typical charge for a New Year's Eve is not less than 500 rubles.
There are several taxi services operating in Moscow, the most noticeable on the streets being The New Yellow Taxi (<b>Novoye Zholtoye Taxi</b>). The cars are yellow Fords or Volgas (Russian car brand). They will charge the minimum rate of around 250 rubles no matter the distance. It is, however, possible to negotiate the price with the driver as well as he will basically switch off the meter and pocket the fare.
You can call a cab over the phone, too, but most Muscovites will do it only at night or to get to an airport. On some rare occasions phone taxi may be as bad as illegal as a street ride, but if you take your time researching in internet, you will find many registered taxi companies that offer completely safe and sound western-like services, some will even refuse to drive you if you don't wear seatbelt. Most western embassies will provide you with a list of tried and tested legit taxi companies that will send a cab to pick you up 24/7 anywhere in Moscow in a safe way at a decent price.
If you're not good in Russian, there are several English-speaking taxi services operating in Moscow.
If you do use a car to arrive in Moscow, it can be very time consuming and stressful to get around. The street system was never designed to accommodate even a fraction of the exploding population of vehicles; the traffic jams on the Sadovoye Ring often do not clear between the morning and the evening rush hours. Most roadways are in a constant state of disastrous disrepair. You will have to compete for every inch of space on the road (quite literally; the proper distance between the vehicles for a Muscovite is close to zero) with seasoned drivers in dented "Ladas" who know the tangle of the streets inside out and will not think twice before cutting you off at the first opportunity.
The drivers of the ubiquitous yellow "marshrutka" route taxis can seem to be nearly suicidal, and account for a significant percentage of all accidents, while buses stop, go and barge in and out of traffic at will, blissfully unaware of the surroundings. One bright spot is the relative dearth of the large 18-wheeler trucks on Moscow roads; they do ply the Ring Road, however. From time to time all traffic on major thoroughfares may be blocked by police to allow government officials to blow through unimpeded, sirens blaring. Another problem is parking.  There is very little of it. Even if there are cars parked, it doesn't mean its always legal; this would mean finding upon return a hefty fine (3000 rubles) or your car being towed ("evacuated"). Park as soon as you can at a safe place (your hotel, for example) and use public transit.
But if you managed to have driven in <a href="/en/Rome" title="Rome">Rome</a> or <a href="/en/Athens" title="Athens">Athens</a> before, then it's not that hard to get accustomed to Moscow traffic. Just don't try to cross the city during rush hours or you can be stuck for as long as 8 h in traffic jams. In the middle of the day it may take as long as 2-3 h to cross the city (and only 1 h by metro).
The safest and easiest time to drive, when the roads are relatively empty and you can reach your destination quite easily, are the following:
<b>Traffic jam information</b> Anyway, before planning the car trip in Moscow, it's always recommended to check one of the many traffic jam information websites. This way you can immediately see if it worth going by car or if it's better to use a metro. The most popular ones are Yandex Probki <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://probki.yandex.ru">[22]</a> and Rambler Probki <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://probki.rambler.ru">[23]</a>.
<b>Gas stations</b>: BP, Lukoil, Gazpromneft, Rosneft gas stations all have good quality gasoline.
The famous "Raketa" speed ferries, departing to destinations at the suburban beaches, were unfortunately decommissioned following the 2007 season.
There still exists the "river bus" system, in the fashion of the Venetian <i>vaporetti</i> - in the warmer months, of course, since the river is ice-bound most winters. The only regular route has 7 stops <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.russia-welcome.com/index.php?id=141">[24]</a>, from the quay near the Kievsky rail station, downstream through the centre, terminating at Novospassky bridge (about half a mile from Proletarskaya Metro), and back. Ferries (passengers only) depart about once hourly, every day; the fare is RUB400 <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://translate.google.com/translate?prev=hp&amp;hl=en&amp;js=n&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cck-ship.ru%2Findex.php%3Fcon_id%3Dcity&amp;sl=ru&amp;tl=en&amp;history_state0=">[25]</a>. The ride is a pleasant diversion on a hot summer day, as you float past the Kremlin walls and under the bridges, but don't rely on it for transportation.
Since 2009 you can make a trip across the Moskva River on the snow-white yachts of the fleet "Radisson Royal Hotel, Moscow"<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.radisson-cruise.ru/index_en.php">[26]</a>. New yachts-restaurants ("Ferdinand", "Bon Voyage", "Selebrity", "Capella" and "Skarlet") unlike other tourist yachts on the Moskva River do not stop navigation in winter: they can move on ice very smoothly so that the waiter can easily pour champagne in crystal glasses on a table. The huge panoramic windows protect passengers from bad weather and city noise. Typical river trip starts from Ukraina Hotel embankment and takes a cruise with duration of 2.5-3 hours with english/russian audio guide onboard.
There is also a short monorail line, running from VDNKh to Timiryazevskaya metro stations. The system is unified with metro since April 2013. The Moscow monorail is slower and does not run as frequently as the Metro (every 6 min at peak hours, 16 min rest of the time), opens later, and closes earlier. It is useful to get to the Ostankino Tower, or to get to the VDNKh exhibition centre from the Metro Silver (9) line.
A convenient way to get around the center is the newly opened (2008) <b>Hop On Hop Off</b> tour bus service operating in the historic city center of Moscow.  Buses go every 30 min in a loop around Moscow and stop in front of most of the major hotels. Live English speaking guides on board will answer all your questions. The price is 750 rubles for a ticket valid for 24 h, and you may board and disembark at any stop along the route as many times as you like.<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.hoponhopoff.ru/">[27]</a>
Less essential sites, but very worthwhile if you have the time, include:
A great way to orient yourself when you arrive in Moscow is to take the newly launched <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.freemoscowbus.com">Free Moscow Bus Tour</a> â˜Ž +7 916 564 4274  email: info@freemoscowbus.com  This is a free tour sponsored by local Moscow businesses, volunteers and supported by the city of Moscow. Reserve on-line well in advance as it can fill up fast.
Moscow has many attractions, but many of them are not friendly to a non-Russian-speaker. English-language newspapers like <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.themoscowtimes.com">The Moscow Times</a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.elementmoscow.ru">Element</a>, <i>Moscow News</i> and others can help navigate towards English-language friendly attractions and services.
Moscow has two <b>circuses</b>, the Nikulin circus on Tsvetnoi Bulvar (metro Tsvetnoi Bulvar), and the new circus near the University. Tickets can be bought for as little as 200 rubles, and even these seats are good. Touts may be selling tickets outside and can save you a lot of queueing, and they'll speak more English than the ticket office. Sometimes they are selling tickets at the cover price, and sometime at twice the price. Ask and make sure before parting with your cash.
The <b>Obraztsov Puppet Theatre</b> at the very north part of the Garden Ring has performances during the winter in the evening. Everything is in Russian and meant for children, but the stories are simple and quite understandable even if you don't understand Russian. There is a small box in front of the building where a puppet appears every hour and does a performance. At 12 midday all of the puppets appear for a short but entertaining appearance.
The <b>Novaya Opera</b> (new opera) in the Hermitage gardens features operas mainly in Russian most evenings, starting at 19:00. Tickets are normally available from 200 rubles. Ticket office is open 12:00-15:00 and then again 16:00-19:00.
Make sure you visit a <b>Russian bathhouse</b> <i>(banya)</i> while in Moscow, as it's an important Russian tradition and Russians, especially 40+, go at least once a week. Have a hot steam, followed by a good whipping with birch branches. While its not the most pleasant experience, the benefits you'll receive afterward will enable you to understand why Russians are loyal to their banya. Most famous banya is the Sanduny (or Sandunovskaya banya).
Like any city with snowy winters, Moscow is a great place to go <b>ice skating</b>. Gorky Park is most famous but overcrowded and ice is not always in ideal condition; Bosco rink on a Red Square is glamorous and easy, although bit costly and not too favoured by advanced skaters. Luzhniki has arguably the best ice, although service can be tough and open hours are not always convenient. The winter rinks at Chistye Prudy or Izmaylovsky Park can be other alternatives.
An alternative way to explore Moscow is to get to know it from the inside, by walking and talking with locals and trying out local activities. Local residents can tell you a plenty of stories, show you some secret places (as roofs, courtyards, funcy eateries etc.) and will treat you as a friend.
Moscow remains the educational center of Russia and the former USSR. There are 222 institutes of higher education, including 60 state universities &amp; 90 colleges. Some of these offer a wide-spectrum of programs, but most are centered around a specific field. This is a hold-over from the days of the USSR, when Sovietwide there were only a handful of wide-spectrum "universities" and a large number of narrow-specialization "institutes" (mostly in Moscow &amp; St.Petersburg). Moscow offers some of the best business/management, science, &amp; arts schools in the world. Moscow is also a popular destination for foreign students to learn Russian.
You will need a work visa which is not an easy process. The visa needs to be arranged well in advance of travelling.
It is possible to work in Moscow, you just need to find a good company to support you.
Credit cards usage is becoming more and more widespread, but many cheaper stores and restaurants won't accept them, so cash is a necessity. Be sure to break your 5000 or 1000 RUB notes where you can, as the smaller merchants, street vendors and even many metro clerks will likely refuse them. While you are able to get some smaller vendors to accept U.S. dollars and Euros, it is always best to change currency, which is not a problem as currency exchange spots are everywhere, displaying the daily rates in large yellow letters. Read the terms carefully; even if the offer seems attractive, there may be a fixed-sum commission on top of it, or the advertised rate might apply only to large transactions (US$1,000 and up), while a less favourable one is in effect for smaller ones. Don't forget to check the change returned to you (the most common scam is to let a banknote "stick" inadvertently to the back of the little turnstile which the clerk is using to pass the money back and forth) and do not simply say yes to what you do not understand. A good approach to exchanging currency is to use bank ("Ð‘Ð°Ð½Ðº" in Russian) offices. There are lots of them in the centre of city (broadly defined as the inside of the Garden Ring). Better yet, use your own bank card from home at an ATM to draw money directly from your checking account, as the machines are almost all compatible with major Western money systems (Cirrus/MasterCard and PLUS/Visa) - not only you'll get a decent fixed bank rate, but also often a screen menu in friendly (albeit somewhat broken) English.
Buying souvenirs can be quite a chore if you do not stay in the centre of Moscow. You can get cheaper souvenirs from Izmaylovskiy Market in Izmalylovo Park. Walking out in the middle of a bargaining session will most likely NOT get you the price you want.
Generally, you can find different sized fully featured malls near almost every metro station, especially in residential areas.
There is a online shopping aggregator, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://market.yandex.ru">Yandex Market</a>, where it is possible to find lots of other goods.
Most tourists will find that going out to eat in Moscow is quite expensive. It does not have to be that way, it's just that the options most visible for the foreigner generally are.
There are a number of American franchise restaurants, such as McDonald's and TGI Friday's; it's a familiar, if boring eat at a reasonable price.
A huge and quickly growing range of restaurants, with a matching range of prices, has developed in Moscow. The average cost per person for a middle to top class restaurant will be $30 to $200 (more if one goes for vintage wines). A quick 'canteen' style meal in a 'Stolovaya' can cost about $3 and is generally underground, near famous monuments and subway stations. These large food courts sometimes also contain a small mall. They will usually include toilets but be prepared to pay around $1 to use them.  Lately a lot of new "middle-class" restaurants have opened, filled with families on weekends. The omnipresent McDonald's have outlets near many metro stations.
Non-chain restaurants and cafes promising "European and Caucasus cuisine" are equally bad in either one most of the time; seek a specialist single-region venue instead (Georgian, Russian, Italian, French etc).
Many small restaurants within the Sadovoye ring are now offering prix-fixe "business lunches" at around RUB200-250, for the teeming hordes of white-collars populating the neighbourhood during the day. These deals are valid in the middle of the day (12:00-15:00) and include a cup of soup or an appetizer, the main dish of the day (a smaller portion than if you order a la carte; sometimes there's even a limited choice), bread (no Russian eats anything without a slice) and a beverage (soda or coffee/tea; beer costs extra); it is a reasonably priced, freshly cooked quick meal in the middle of your wanderings which will tide you through to the evening.
Wait staff in Russia are not as dependent on tips for a big chunk of their pay as, say, in the US, so the expected amount is correspondingly less, and you generally will not be looked at with hidden malice even if you take all of the change brought back to you, but tipping is still encouraged. If your total is under 500 rubles, round it up to the nearest fifty; under 1000 - to the nearest hundred; from 1,000 to 1,500 a hundred-bill is appropriate. If you are going above that, 10% would be reasonably generous; in really swanky places, though, all bets are off. Don't tip in cafeteria-like settings, where you travel along the counter with a tray and pay at the cash register. Throw a couple of tens into the tip jar for baristas. Note: there is no way to leave a tip on the credit card - when you receive the slip for signature, there isn't a place to write the extra amount in, so keep enough small bills in your wallet.
<b>Azerbaijani</b> â€“ Azerbaijani cuisine is probably the most popular in Moscow.You can find Azerbaijani restaurants everywhere in Moscow.It is strongly recommended if you want to try delicious food in Moscow.
<b>Armenian</b> - Similar to Turkish and Azerbaijani cuisine but with an exciting twist to it. Try out their mouth watering charcoal grilled kebabs and fish dishes. Many good restaurants available around Moscow and many of the chefs are actually natives from Armenia, which adds to the authenticity of the food. Try out Restaurant Gavan at the address: â€œulitsa Rossolimo 7, gorod Moskvaâ€ . Take metro to Park Kulâ€™tury station, also not far away from the famous Gorky Park.
<b>Georgian</b> â€“ Besides Russian cuisine, one variety of ethnic food that is strongly recommended while in Moscow is Georgian. This cuisine is generally spicier than Russian food, and there are a number of reasonably priced Georgian restaurants in Moscow.
<b>Japanese</b> â€“ Muscovites have been obsessed with sushi since late 1990s, and the boom is not over yet. Japanese restaurants are probably most popular among young Russian women, easily competing with Italian and French restaurants.  The picture menus are a great help when ordering, and the names of items are basically just Japanese transliterated to Cyrillic. Don't expect a proliferation of raw fish, though; the most popular rolls contain cooked items.
<b>Thai</b> cuisine can be found only in few restaurants, and its authenticity is debatable.
<b>Vietnamese</b> and <b>Chinese</b> cuisines are not popular with Russians, but can be found if you search for it.
Free-standing street food is well represented with hot dogs/sausages, meat pastries and doner kebab (shawarma) kiosks (dwindling in numbers, though, as part of the mayor's quest for limiting immigrant businesses under the guise of sanitary enforcement). The latter are tasty, if not entirely authentic, but can be risky; pack Pepto-Bismol.
There are also several chains of outdoor stand-up food vendors, usually located in clusters around Metro stations.  A few to look for are:
Muscovites are also fond of their ice cream, consumed in any weather, even (proudly) in the dead of winter, cheap and usually of superior quality; kiosks can be found all over the center and near all Metro stations.
In these you take a tray, move along a counter with food (either taking the dishes yourself or asking the staff to give you a bowl of soup, a plate of vegetables etc.) and pay at the cash register at the end of the counter. <b>By far, this is the best choice of eating out on a budget in Moscow.</b> You eat fresh healthy food (and not hamburgers or any other fast food), you <b>don't</b> have to ponder how much tips is enough (because there's no one to tip, you just pay a fixed price at the cash register) and you don't need to be starving for 40 minutes while the chef is cooking your food (everything is cooked already).
<span class='vcard' id = 'Moo-Moo'><span class="fn org">Moo-Moo</span> (<span class="nickname"><span class="non-latin">ÐœÑƒ</span>-<span class="non-latin">ÐœÑƒ</span></span>), <a class="url external autonumber" href="http://www.cafemumu.ru/" rel="nofollow">[57]</a>. <span class="description">30+ restaurants of this chain offer decent canteen food, with English menus. Typical open hours are 10:00-22:00, but they differ in different restaurants of the chain, and a couple of them work virtually round clock (with only a break from 3:00 am to 5:00 am). A soup is 75-85 rubles ($2.5-3), many mains are less than 100 rubles ($3.5, but do look at the price tags -- there are much more expensive dishes as well). If your are wise enough not to drink (drinks are relatively more expensive here) and to look at the price tags, you will be full for 200-250 rubles ($7-9). <i>The author of these lines has lived in Moscow for 15 years, and eats in Moo-Moo himself when too lazy to cook at home (which is often), usually leaving around 200 rubles for a dinner without a drink.</i></span> &#160;<a class="listing-edit" href="#Moo-Moo" onclick="editListing('Moo-Moo', 'eat', 'Moscow');return false;" title="click to edit Moo-Moo" rel="nofollow">edit</a></span>

Another cheap option is fast food, a growing trend in Moscow. The likes of <b>McDonald's</b> and <b>KFC</b> are seen near almost every shopping mall.
There are several chains of restaurants that are now very widespread, and again are usually located near metro stations. The 1990 opening of <b>McDonalds</b> was an international event, and now it has over 70 outlets in Moscow.
There are several bars in central Moscow worth visiting.
<br />
Moscow has a good selection of tea saloons. Beyond them, high-quality infusion teas like Newby, are widely available in cafes, both packeted and loose.
Asking to add boiling water to the tea you ordered earlier is a practice that some cafes don't welcome, but normally it's acceptable. However, initiative from the waiter is really rare in this respect.
According to Vedomosti (March 2009), best coffee can be found in:
Other places:
There is a big need for mid-range accommodations in Moscow, and the curious traveler can find some good ones -- with a little diligence.
Moscow historically enjoyed a low crime rate. However, Moscow is a booming metropolis, so common sense should be used. Avoid dark alleys - like you would anywhere else.  Check the advice from your Foreign Office for entry requirements, health, safety, local laws and customs.
Do keep in mind, that while traveling in Moscow, as in the rest of Russia, you must always have your passport with you. If you look non-white, your papers may get checked more often than usual.
Usually, the police will demand to see your papers to check if you have been registered within seven business days (used to be three business days up to March 25th, 2011) of your arrival into Moscow. Always remember that if you stay in a hotel then you are automatically registered and will be handed a confirmation paper at a time of check-in, so no worry in this case. Most policemen do not speak a word of English, but they will let you know if your papers are not in order and you must go with them to the police precinct. In any case, if you are a decent looking person (regardless of race and nationality) odds to be asked to show documents are minuscule, and the police are usually looking for migrants from Central Asia.
Also note that in winter months, streets in Moscow can get very slippery. Take a pair of grippy shoes or, even better, boots (to prevent twisted ankles) and a waterproof raincoat. Take care as ice patches are often hard to spot, even when they appear to have been cleared or melted. Wearing non-grippy shoes could result in injury.
Downtown Moscow is very brightly lit, and a lot of the wide roads have underground pedestrian walkways.  Those are well lit too - so you shouldn't worry about going down inside them.  But of course, like anywhere else, do use common sense, and keep an eye out for pickpockets.  Use the pedestrian crossings to cross the street, as traffic can get pretty crazy sometimes.
In Moscow there are three main GSM operators (MTS, Beeline, Megafon), and they often have offers that give you a SIM card for free or at least very cheap. If you are planning to stay a while and to keep in touch with Russian people, then you should consider buying a local pay-as-you-go SIM card instead of going on roaming. Almost any European phone, and those from the U.S. which work on a GSM network (T-Mobile, or AT&amp;T), carry the "tri-band" or "World phone" designation and had been unlocked, should work on the Russian standard (if yours is not one of those, a basic new candybar will still run you considerably less than $40 without a contract). If you buy a SIM card from a shop you'll need your passport for identification. It only takes five minutes to do the paperwork and it will cost less than $10. You will receive a number in the "mobile" area code, starting with 9, which has more expensive rates for calls to and from landlines (and from abroad; in compensation, the tariffs for calls to phones on the same network are usually reduced), and your card will be preloaded with a small initial minute allowance. Incoming calls are free. Top off at the stores of your chosen company, at shops selling phones, or at newer automated kiosks which accept utility payments (they look like short, squat ATMs with large touchscreens, and display, among others, logos of the mobile operators); the latter charge a small commission fee and accept cash or (rarely) credit cards. Be careful when entering the number: it is possible to add airtime to any phone, not only your own.
For calls abroad there are different inexpensive pre-paid cards (e.g. Arktel), which you can find at many shops and kiosks throughout the city or in any post office.
BeelineWiFi (former GoldenWiFi, acquired by Beeline ) is the largest network of Wi-Fi access points, available almost everywhere within a Third Ring Road and a Garden Ring, less frequently outside it. Most of them are free (paid by the venue, e.g. a cafe or mall) - whenever you are at a cafe, ask your waiter for a free WiFi pass slip if your device doesnt connect automatically. Very few require an account. Rates are 50 rubles for an hour, 100 rubles for 24 hours, 500 rubles for 30 days; if you have a credit card, it's a fairly simple process completed entirely online - you are presented with the payment choice screen as soon as you connect. Airports are flooded with the paid access, so as to drown the (few) free choices. In some places, pre-paid cards can be acquired at the cashier's desk (e.g. Starbucks) or in outlets selling mobile phones.  Gorky Park also has free Wi-Fi access points.
McDonalds has free (as in a 30-minute voucher with every meal) Wi-Fi in nearly every other of their locations in the city (and in most of them within a Garden Ring)â€”operated also by BeelineWiFi.
Look out for "Free WiFi" sign in most of the malls. At least one free-for-all WiFi spot is located in "Respublika" bookstore on Tverskaya near Mayakovskaya metro - you can use it without limits as long as you're about 15 meters from the store's entrance. Benches are provided and often packed with people.
Free Wi-Fi is also available on the Ring line (Brown) of the Moscow metro.
There is also a 4G LTE provider called Yota <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.yota.ru/en/">[120]</a> available in Moscow and some other cities. You can buy their USB modem in almost every outlet selling mobile phones (Euroset, Svyaznoi, I-on etc.) as well as in any computer related store. The price of the modem is 2900 rubles. You can use it for free for 7 days, after you should select your tariff on their site (<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://my.yota.ru/">https://my.yota.ru/</a>) suggested in English as well. To switch the language, click "EN" on the top. The advantage of this operator is that you can change your tariff at any time without paying. You just choose another tariff using the scroll bar, and the amount of days will be changed according to your current payment, the speed will increase. Also Megafon currently offers 4G (LTE) connections.
The 3G(HSDPA) coverage is also available in most areas provided by MegaFon, MTS, BeeLine. There is also a CDMA (EV-DO rev. A) wireless internet available provided by Skylink <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.skylink.ru">[121]</a> but you have to buy their hardware (450Mhz) like USB modem for 1890 rub to use it (runs at 450MHz and it's not compatible with CDMA equipment used in the U.S. etc.).
Moscow is one of the global diplomatic capitals, competing with <a href="/en/Berlin" title="Berlin">Berlin</a>, <a href="/en/Paris" title="Paris">Paris</a>, <a href="/en/London" title="London">London</a>, and <a href="/en/Washington,_D.C." title="Washington, D.C.">Washington D.C.</a>. Most countries have embassies in the city.
Since Moscow is the biggest transportation centre in Russia and one of main the points of entry for the foreign tourists, it is a convenient starting point for exploring much of European Russia. Even travelling through Moscow to Ukraine and some Caucasian and Central Asian countries (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan etc.) could be cheaper than direct flights from Europe/North America. Travel deals to Moscow are not rare and ticket prices are often pretty low within the former USSR.<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.moscow-city.ru">Moscow</a> (<a href="/en/Russian_phrasebook" title="Russian phrasebook">Russian</a>: <i>ÐÐ¾ÑÐºÐ²Ð°</i>) is the 860 year-old capital of the <a href="/en/Russia" title="Russia">Russian Federation</a>. A truly iconic, global city, Moscow has played a central role in the development of the Russian state and indeed the world. For many, the sight of the Kremlin complex in the centre of the city is still loaded with symbolism and history - Moscow was the capital of the former <a href="/en/Soviet_Union" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> and signs of its previous life are very visible even now. Yet, there's more to Russia and its capital than just memories of the USSR. Architectural gems from the time of the Russian Empire are still dotted throughout Moscow, whilst signs of modern Tsars (or at least people with similar levels of wealth) abound.
Moscow is the financial and political centre of Russia and the former Soviet Union, with a population of around 13 million, and covers an area of around 1,080 kmÂ². One-tenth of all Russian citizens live in the metropolitan area. Moscow is in GMT+4 time zone.
For many years since the break up of the Soviet Union, the economy has improved, and the modern era has brought upon a wide variety of construction projects, modern architecture and quasi-modern transport systems.
Moscow's long time mayor, Yury Luzhkov initiated these changes during his time in office, but was fired in September 2010 for allegedly insulting the president through a scathing letter.
His successor, Sergei Sobyanin, has begun to gradually relax Luzhkov's construction plan, and a majority of Luzhkov's plans have been stopped or abandoned.
Moscow is a large metropolis on the Moskva River, which bends its way through the city. Most of the main sites are on the northern bank of the river. The other major waterway is the Yauza River, which flows into the Moskva east of the Kremlin.
<br />
Much of Moscow's geography is defined by the numerous 'Ring Roads' that circle the city at various distances from the centre, roughly following the outline of the walls that used to surround Moscow. With Red Square and the Kremlin forming the very centre, the innermost ring road is the Boulevard Ring (<i>Bulvarnoye Koltso</i>), built in the 1820s where the 16th century walls used to be. It runs from the Christ the Savior Cathedral in south-west central Moscow, to the mouth of the Yauza in south-east central Moscow.
The next ring road, the Garden Ring (<i>Sadovoe Koltso</i>), derives its name from the fact that landowners near the road in Tsarist times were obligated to maintain gardens to make the road attractive. In Soviet times, the road was widened, and currently you will find no gardens there.
The recently constructed Third Ring is not much use for tourists but is a heavily used motorway which absorbs a bit of Moscow's traffic. It roughly follows the outline of <i>Kamer-Kollezhsky val</i>, the customs and passport boundary of Moscow between 1742 and 1852. The outer edge of Moscow is largely defined by the Moscow Ring Road (widely known by its abbreviation: MKAD-Moskovskaya koltsevaya avtomobilnaya doroga), a motorway which is 108 km long and encircles the entire city (similar to London's M25 and Paris' <i>PÃ©riphÃ©rique</i>). A Fourth Ring was planned to be built between the Third Ring and the Moscow Ring Road, using in places the right-of-way of the freight rail loop, but the new mayor's administration announced the project was abandoned.
If you need a visa to go to Russia, Moscow is no exception; there's no specific Moscow visa - once you have a valid Russian visa, you can go to Moscow as well as any other place in Russia. See <a href="/en/Russia#Get_in" title="Russia">Russia#Get in</a> for details.
Moscow (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IATA" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:IATA">IATA</a>: <b>MOW</b>) has three main airports:
If you are a Gazprom functionary or a business traveller with a private jet, you may also find yourself landing in <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://ostafyevo-airport.com/"><b>Ostafyevo Airport</b></a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICAO" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:ICAO">ICAO</a>: <b>UUMO</b>).
Moscow is by far the main air traffic hub of Russia and will continue to be as both Sheremetyevo and Vnukovo are undergoing major development plans.
During the years 1980-1991 all international flights to Moscow landed at Sheremetyevo International Airport, commonly called Sheremetyevo II, which was recently renamed "Terminal F". The home base of Aeroflot's international services, Sheremetyevo II was built for the 1980 Summer Olympics. Sheremetyevo I (now "Terminal B") was built in 1960s as the then's international terminal, but after 1980 was "downgraded" to domestic service. Today Sheremetyevo also has four new terminals - A (business aviation), C, D and E. Aeroflot operates in terminals D, E and F.
In mid-2000s, Sheremetyevo was eclipsed by Domodedovo, which underwent a renovation and has always had a direct commuter rail link to the city. Many international carriers, including British Airways and Lufthansa, switched to Domodedovo and since 2005 it has catered to more passengers than Sheremetyevo. Aeroflot's biggest competitors S7 (Sibir) and Transaero, along with a slew of minnows, are based at Domodedovo.
In the last years, the third airport, Vnukovo, has launched a major reconstruction project as well and has managed to attract a number of airlines including Turkish Airlines and Lufthansa. UTAir, a major domestic airline, has operated its network from Vnukovo for decades.
If you prefer to go to the airport by car, it is best to call a taxi agency and book a cab. There are many agencies that can provide this service, and the cost ranges from â¬30-50 or more. Be sure to check the list of official taxi operators on the official websites of airports. <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.domodedovo.ru/en/main/getting/taxi/">[1]</a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://svo.aero/en/transport/#taxi">[2]</a>. With telephone or online pre-booking you will be able to get a taxi for a cheaper price. All airports also have taxi kiosks where you can get yourself a driver at a fixed price, but a bit higher than if you book taxi online or by phone in advance. Don't listen to people jumping at you in the terminal as soon as you clear customs with offers of a taxi in several languages - at best it will get you a major rip-off, and may be unsafe to boot. For public transportation see below:
<b>Sheremetyevo International Airport</b>, (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IATA" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:IATA">IATA</a>: <b>SVO</b>) <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.svo.aero/en/">[3]</a> has terminals A (business aviation), B, C, D, E and F on both sides of the runway  <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.svo.aero/en/map/">[4]</a>. You can walk between terminals A, B and C; or between terminals D, E and F; but you have to take a shuttle bus <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.svo.aero/en/between-terminals/">[5]</a> or a taxi to go between the two sites. Sheremetyevo I is the old name for Terminal B, and Sheremetyevo II is the old name for Terminal F.
International flights depart terminals C, D, E and F. Domestic destinations are operated out of terminals B and D. Aeroflot has concentrated most of its flights to the newly built Terminal D (was known during the construction time as "Terminal 3" or "Sheremetyevo III"), though some flights are operated from E and F.
Sheremetyevo, north of the city centre, is about as close to downtown Moscow as Vnukovo, but the major road leading to it, Leningradskoye Shosse, is one of the busiest in the city and is normally a giant traffic jam most of the day.
The quickest way to get to Sheremetyevo is to take an <i>Aeroexpress</i> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.aeroexpress.ru/en/">[6]</a> train from Belorussky Railway Terminal (see below). These depart from a dedicated terminal (3d or 4th entrances) from 5:50AM to 11:30PM every 30 or 60 minutes (check their website before you go, there is a 2-hr "window" in the schedule between 11am and 1pm from the city terminal, and from 10:30am to 12:30pm from Sheremetyevo), and now connect directly to SVO-2/D/E/F, with a shuttle bus service to SVO-1/B/C. The journey takes 35 minutes and costs 320 rubles one-way (as of June 2013). Keep your paper or mobile ticket for the whole of the Aeroexpress journey. In contrast to many other airports, Sheremetyevo isn't served by a mixture of express and suburban trains, and the Aeroexpress is the only rail link to it.
If you are not in a hurry (particularly if you are going from the airport to the city), you can get to the airport by local transport. Bus 851 departs from Rechnoy Vokzal subway station (North of the green line), bus 817 departs from Planernaya (North of the purple line). The station in the airport is near the exit of terminals E, F. The cost is equal to the cost of a normal bus journey inside the city (single-ride tickets cost 25 RUB at the vendor kiosks, 28 RUB from the driver). Mind that the buses might be stuck in a traffic jam.
For leaving a car near the airport for the length of your trip outside Moscow, there are numerous (non)official parking lots between SVO1 and SVO2; rates start from 200 rubles/day and up.
Most flights from/to Sheremetyevo II are operated either by Aeroflot or by its partner international carriers, mostly members of the SkyTeam alliance. Check-in starts two hours before departure time (three hours for U.S.-bound flights).
If you fly economy and there are several people in your group, for check-in it's better to have someone to stand in business class queue, especially if you arrive before registration starts: business-class clerk opens first and may take on economy class passengers if there's none (or at least not too many) business-class customers.
Ground-floor is the arrivals level, with departures being one level above.
Driving in to Sheremetyevo II area (going behind toll bar) is hugely overpriced and should be avoided whenever possible. In addition to entry charge of 100 rubles/hour (rounded up to the next hour), after entering the toll bar, there is an extra charge taken, from 100 rubles/hour to 300 rubles/hour, depending on the distance from entrance and the comfort of parkingâwith an unofficial option of an unlimited-time stay for 300 rubles.
In the pre-check-in area on the departures level, there's only TGI Friday plus six to eight no-name cafes/bars/coffee shops. TGIF can make your coffee to go, but charges about 360 rubles for mid-sized latte and serves it in Coca-Cola-branded paper cups. They also have free Wi-Fi which can be used outside of the restaurant as well. The TGIF serves the same menu as in America, which may come in handy on your way out if you have grown tired of salty smoked fish and warm drinks. There's a cheap self-service cafeteria two levels up (use the elevator or the stairs), where all the airport workers eat, and a more formal 1980's Soviet-retro-chic restaurant above it. Both have nice view of the tarmac.
Most cafes and restaurants beyond passport control are faceless and overpriced. Club Bar boasts Ronnefeldt teas and decent pancakes however. Note that you have to clear customs before check-in so there's practically no going back after you check-in to the cafeteria or the restaurant upstairs.
The airport has banking and currency exchange offices, and ATMs are available in both the arrivals and departures areas. Remember to change your rubles into Euros or USD before departing Moscow, as almost no other country will cash in your rubles for you. Duty-free shops operated by Aerofirst Moscow Duty Free <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.dutyfree.ru/default.aspx?lang=en">[7]</a> cover a large space, but merely repeat the same choice in five or six outlets. As elsewhere, only the most popular local souvenirs are sold, still with a huge margin. This terminal also has a hairdresser, pharmacy and a medical office as well as at least two travel agencies. Business and first class lounges are in upstairs.
For transit passengers <b>without a Russian visa</b> a possibility exists to stay the night at Novotel hotel just outside the airport. Report to the 'Transfer/Transit without visa' desk upon arrival. You'll be escorted to the hotel in a private bus and stay in a corridor with personal security guard. Rooms are spacious (two queen size beds) and comfortable. You'll be picked up by Aeroflot staff about one hour prior to departure and the bus will bring you directly to the departure gate. Cost of this service is around RUB 6700 for a room.
The information desk is in the main hall and sometimes you are lucky enough to get someone who speaks reasonably good English. The number is +7 495 956-4666.  You can also call an Intourist representatives (available in Terminal 2) who can provide tourist information at +7 495 578-5971.
<b>Domodedovo International Airport</b> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IATA" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:IATA">IATA</a>: <b>DME</b>) <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://domodedovo.ru/en/">[8]</a> is south of the city center and is the main hub of S7 Airlines and Transaero, large domestic airlines in Russia also serving numerous international destinations. Many international carriers, including British Airways, Lufthansa and budget airline easyJet, also use Domodedovo and since 2005 it has catered to more passengers than Sheremetyevo.
The railway station is located directly inside the airport and is served by the non-stop <i>Aeroexpress</i> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.aeroexpress.ru/en/domodedovo.html">[9]</a> train as well as commuter trains, both running to the Paveletsky Rail Terminal in central Moscow. The Aeroexpress runs every 30 minutes and takes 45-50 minutes to the centre and costs 320 rubles, whereas the commuter train runs 10-11 times/day, takes 65-70 minutes and costs 99 rubles.
A shuttle bus runs from the Metro station at Domodedovskaya to the airport every 15 minutes, taking around 30 minutes for the trip and costing 100 rubles.  The bus is actually a very comfortable coach service with plenty of luggage space (luggage is included in the price).  Domodedovskaya is around 20 minutes from Paveletsky, and if you are getting the metro at the end of your trip it may work out a simpler and cheaper journey than the Aeroexpress.  The shuttle bus is numbered 308, and departs from the bus parking on the left around 30 metres in front of the terminal building.  At Domodedovskaya take the exit to the south (downtown side) turn right in the underpass, and follow it to the end, then take the stairs.  There are crude stencilled signs on the pillars to guide you.  The bus stop is immediately at the top of the stairs.
<b>Vnukovo International Airport</b> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IATA" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:IATA">IATA</a>: <b>VKO</b>) <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.vnukovo.ru/eng/insex.wbp">[10]</a> is southwest from the city centre and is served by such airlines as UTair, Transaero, Yakutia, Lufthansa, Germanwings etc. The new Terminal A was opened in December 2010 and offers both domestic and international flights. Terminal D is used for domestic arrivals from North Caucasus only. You can take an <i>Aeroexpress</i> train <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.aeroexpress.ru/en/schedule/vnukovo/">[11]</a> from Kievsky Train Station, which departs 07:00-24:00 every 60 minutes in peak hours (with intervals of about four hours for off-peak hours). The journey takes 35-45 minutes and costs 320 rubles one way. There is an express bus connection between Domodedovo and Vnukovo airports, which departs about every 90 minutes. 
Another convenient and fast way to get to Vnukovo is the local transport. Take the subway to Yugo-Zapadnaya station (the last one on the red line). 
Then you can take the small mini-busses next to the exit of the subway. These mini-busses depart every ~10 minutes, and the journey doesn't take more than 30 minutes since the road is usually not heavily congested. This way it costs 25RUB for the subway and 50 RUB for the bus. A little bit unconfortable if you travel with many or big luggages.
<b>Ostafyevo International Airport</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://ostafyevo-airport.com/">[12]</a> is located south from Moscow in Podolsk district, about 3 km to the west of Scherbinka railway station, from where you need to take a taxi, and is the home of GazpromAvia airlines. It caters mainly to business aviation.
Moscow is the principal railway hub of Russia, from here you can reach almost all corners of this vast country and far into <a href="/en/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a> or <a href="/en/Asia" title="Asia">Asia</a>. A side-effect of this is that it's often easier for a someone going cross-country to change trains in Moscow, even if it's a little out of the way, as the choice of direct trains is limited compared to the ones going to the capital. This means, unfortunately, that main train stations are always crowded with transients, and are generally about the most unsafe places in the city.
This said, and even with proliferation of large and small air carriers in the post-Soviet Russia and the price of plane tickets coming down considerably (and the price of rail tickets creeping up year after year), train travel still remains the predominant mode of middle- and even long-distance transportation for the majority of Russians. In a day and a night a traveler based in Moscow can cover a significant part of the Eastern Europe; two nights and the intervening day will find you the second morning as far south as the Black Sea and as far East as Ural Mountains.
Most long-distance trains are operated by <b>FPK</b> (Federal Passenger Company, a subsidiary of Russian Railways <b>RZD</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.rzd.ru">[13]</a>), tickets can be bought both at stations and on-line if you can read Russian. Notice that tickets bought on-line still needs to be validated at a counter or a ticket machine. At the major stations there are often counters with English-speaking personnel.  Sometimes these are marked, and sometimes you will be directed by the first person you speak to another counter with an English speaker.
<b>From Saint Petersburg</b>
With the launch of high-speed <i>Sapsan</i> trains <a href="/en/Saint_Petersburg" title="Saint Petersburg">Saint Petersburg</a> is now just four hours away. There are seven depatures daily at 6:45AM, 7AM, 1:30PM, 1:45PM, 3PM, 7:25PM, and 7:45PM, with some trains stopping at <a href="/en/Tver" title="Tver">Tver</a>, Vyshniy Volochek, Bologoe, and Okulovka. Fares vary but usually land somewhere around 3,000 rubles.
Overnight trains are still very popular however and there are plenty of them, 13 in total, not taking in account those passing in transit. The most famous is the <i>Red Arrow</i> (ÐÑÐ°ÑÐ½Ð°Ñ ÑÑÑÐµÐ»Ð°), departing Saint Petersburg daily at 11:55PM while the song Hymn to the Great City plays.
<b>From Europe</b>
The newly-launched <i>TransEuropeanExpress</i> traverses Europe, making the run <a href="/en/Paris" title="Paris">Paris</a>-Moscow up to four times a week via <a href="/en/Frankfurt" title="Frankfurt">Frankfurt</a>, <a href="/en/Berlin" title="Berlin">Berlin</a> and <a href="/en/Warsaw" title="Warsaw">Warsaw</a> amongst other cities. The train boasts a luxury carriage apart from the normal first and second class and national railways provide restaurant cars. Travel from Paris takes 38 hours, fares are quite high with second class tickets at â¬330.
Several other European cities have direct carriages to Moscow including; <a href="/en/Amsterdam" title="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a> (36 h), <a href="/en/Basel" title="Basel">Basel</a> (38 h), <a href="/en/Bratislava" title="Bratislava">Bratislava</a> (42 h), <a href="/en/Budapest" title="Budapest">Budapest</a> (37 h), <a href="/en/Nice" title="Nice">Nice</a> (49 h, Thursdays) <a href="/en/Prague" title="Prague">Prague</a> (34 h) and <a href="/en/Vienna" title="Vienna">Vienna</a> (34 h). The Amsterdam carriage was discontinued in December 2012. See seat61.com for details.
<b>From Eastern Russia and Asia</b>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<i>See also: <a href="/en/Trans-Siberian_Railway" title="Trans-Siberian Railway">Trans-Siberian Railway</a></i><br />
Moscow lies at the western end of several great train journeys across the Trans-Siberian Railway, the main line runs between Moscow and <a href="/en/Vladivostok" title="Vladivostok">Vladivostok</a>, the principal Russian city along the Pacific Coast. Branded train <i>Rossiya</i> runs every second day and takes seven nights. Stop-overs are made in many important cities in eastern and central Russia including <a href="/en/Irkutsk" title="Irkutsk">Irkutsk</a>, <a href="/en/Krasnoyarsk" title="Krasnoyarsk">Krasnoyarsk</a>, <a href="/en/Novosibirsk" title="Novosibirsk">Novosibirsk</a>, <a href="/en/Omsk" title="Omsk">Omsk</a> and <a href="/en/Yekaterinburg" title="Yekaterinburg">Yekaterinburg</a>. Additional trains are of course available from these cities too. Prices hover around 20,000 rubles for second class.
More common to travellers is the other route, between Moscow and China. There are two weekly trains from <a href="/en/Beijing" title="Beijing">Beijing</a>, the <i>Trans-Mongolian</i> via <a href="/en/Ulaanbaatar" title="Ulaanbaatar">Ulaanbaatar</a> and <i>Vostok</i> via <a href="/en/Manchuria" title="Manchuria" class="mw-redirect">Manchuria</a>. Both journeys take six nights but the one via <a href="/en/Mongolia" title="Mongolia">Mongolia</a> offers more scenery. Tickets for this route can not be bought on-line and travel agencies often pre-book whole compartments and then re-sell them. This means that unless you're lucky and can buy a ticket early you have to book though an travel agency which can be expensive, up to $800 for a one-way ride.
<b>Train stations in Moscow</b>
Moscow has nine train stations, eight of them offering long-distance and local train services (Savyolovsky Station offers local train service only). All are located relatively in the center of Moscow and have metro stations nearby. Be prepared for enormous queues trying to enter or exit the Metro at peak times, as people are getting off or on the commuter trains.
Three of them; <i>Leningradsky</i>, <i>Yaroslavsky</i> and <i>Kazansky</i> are all located on one huge square, informally known as the "Three Stations' Square". A running joke among Moscow taxi drivers ever since the Soviet times is to be able to pick up a fare from one of them to the other, taking the unwary tourist on an elaborate ride in circles.
The direct way to drive from <a href="/en/Germany" title="Germany">Germany</a>, <a href="/en/Poland" title="Poland">Poland</a>, or <a href="/en/Belarus" title="Belarus">Belarus</a> is along the E30 road. However EU or American citizens have to get Belarussian visas to pass through Belarus, so it could be more convenient to go via Latvia (the nearest border crossing between EU and Russia on this direction) using the E22 which starts in <a href="/en/Riga" title="Riga">Riga</a>.
Easy access from <a href="/en/Finland" title="Finland">Finland</a> through <a href="/en/Saint_Petersburg" title="Saint Petersburg">Saint Petersburg</a> and <a href="/en/Novgorod" title="Novgorod">Novgorod</a> is along the E18 road. This route is also known as Russian Federal Highway M-10. Traffic on the M-10 is heavy and driving less relaxing.
Foreign cars &#8211; especially expensive ones &#8211; <i>might</i> attract unwelcome attention, and there is cumbersome paperwork involved.
Many entry points to Moscow - that is, the overpasses carrying the major highways over the Ring Road and into the city - feature rotating roadblocks, where teams of traffic police may stop a vehicle. especially if it is not featuring Moscow plates. You may be stopped and questioned; you'll be allowed to proceed if you have all the proper documents.
Intercity buses to Russian and some former Soviet Union cities depart from the intercity bus station (Ð°Ð²ÑÐ¾Ð²Ð¾ÐºÐ·Ð°Ð») at Shelkovskaya Metro station (the last station of the dark blue line, in northeast Moscow). This is the only place in Moscow from which public transportation is available directly to <a href="/en/Suzdal" title="Suzdal">Suzdal</a>. Also, some intercity buses depart from Komsomolskaya, Tushinskaya, Yugo-Zapadnaya, Vykhino, and Domodedovskaya Metro stations.
Moscow used to be served by regular passenger ships. A system of navigable channels and locks connects the Moskva River with Volga River, which in turn, through the Volga-Baltic channel, provides a way to the <a href="/en/Baltic_Sea" title="Baltic Sea" class="mw-redirect">Baltic Sea</a> (using the Onega, Ladoga and Neva rivers) and further from Ladoga Lake through the White Sea channel to the White Sea; to the south through the Volga-Don channel to the Don river and the Azov and Black Sea; while Volga itself flows into the Caspian Sea. In the Soviet times this allowed the official propaganda to refer to Moscow as "a port on the five seas". There is no scheduled passenger traffic anymore on any of these routes.
There are 2 river terminals in Moscow, on each end of the series of major bridges over the river; these are not capable of being drawn up, and not all of them are of sufficient height to allow large ships to pass. The North Station, in Khimki neighborhood, provides berths for cruise ships to Saint Petersburg, as well as Astrakhan, Rostov-on-Don and other cities along the Volga. The South Station (closest Metro: Kolomenskaya) ceased to be used commercially, since the Oka River, of which the Moskva is a tributary, has silted to the point of being impassable.
Central Moscow is best to be explored on foot, but as the distances are huge, it's easiest to use the famous <b>Metro</b> system <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://engl.mosmetro.ru/">[14]</a>. It is comprehensive, boasts some great architecture, and is relatively cheap.
Since April 2013, Moscow introduced the new ticket system. There are three types of paper tickets, one of them ("TAT") with magnet stripe could be used only in on-ground transportation (buses, trams and trolleybuses), another ("Ediny") is a samrt-card and could be used in metro as well. These kinds of tickets are of pay-per-ride type. Payment does not depend on the length of the trip. Third type of tickets is "90 minutes ride" tickets, they are also paper smart-cards, but allow one ride in metro and unlimited rides in buses etc. for 90 minutes since first validation. By the way you have not to finish your ride within 90 minutes, you have only to make your ticket last validation. "Ediny" and "90 minutes" tickets are sold at manned booths ("kassa") or ticket vending machines within the stations.  The vending machines at most stations sell one or two trip tickets only. The ticket machines have buttons in English as well as Russian.  A convenient way to avoid queuing is to buy a multi-trip ticket for 5, 10, 20 or 60 trips valid for 90 days, or a monthly pass for up to 70 trips; the latter costs almost the same as 60x pass, but is valid for a calendar month, <i>not</i> the 30 days from the date of purchase. One ride with "Ediny" ticket costs 30 RUB, with "90 minutes" costs 50 RUB. The most convinient way to ride all kinds of transportation in Moscow  is "Troika" e-wallet. It's a plastic smart-card which can be refuelled and reimbursed (the deposit is 50 RUB). This e-wallet is smart. First ride on metro will cost 28 RUB, next on-ground ride within 90 minutes will cost only 16 rubles, rest on-ground rides will be free. If you start with on-ground transportation, first ride will cost only 26 RUB, second 18 RUB. Note what you can make only one ride in metro for reduced price within 90 minutes. Transfer from metro to monorail and vice versa is free within 
Details of prices and multiple purchase discounts are on the official website <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://engl.mosmetro.ru/pages/page_0.php?id_page=8">[15]</a>.
24 hours unlimited ticket costs 200 RUB. You can also buy smart-cards for a period from one month up to one year. However, if you lose it, you will not get any refund or replacement.
You can easily find any station you need on the map <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.mosmetro.ru/documents/10871/moscow_metro.pdf">[16]</a>.
Rule of thumb for trip time in Metro is usually to take about 3 minutes for every station you pass.  However, some parts of the metro are very deep, and some transfers are very long.  In the city centre it can save time to go directly to the above-ground entrance of the line you want to take, rather than to enter at a connecting station and transfer underground.  The metro webpage estimates travel times between any pair of stations.  Some escalators are a two minute ride as the stations in the city centre are very deep. On the escalators, stand on the right.
The Metro is open from 5:30 a.m - 1:00 a.m. Station entrances are closed at 1:00 a.m., this is also the time, when last trains start from all of the termini stations of the lines. No one is allowed to start their journey by metro after 1:00 a.m., although trains are still running. Service on the ring line extends for crossing passengers to 1:30 a.m., though entrances are still closed at 1. Short-length escalators and all escalators,  running down, are also locked at 1:00 a.m. (although crossings are not closed while there are trains running) and passengers have to step them. However, long escalators running up work to the last passenger. Before 7:00 a.m. and after 9:00 p.m., the Metro is rarely busy. Between these times on workdays, however, it can be a real squeeze, especially within the ring.
The colors on the signs in the metro don't necessarily correspond to the ones on the maps, so the green line is not necessarily indicated by a green sign (that could be the sign for the gray line).  Use the numbers rather than the colours to avoid any ambiguity.  There are almost <b>no English signs inside</b> so have your itinerary ready beforehand or learn to recognise your station in Cyrillic.  Each metro carriage has a map in latin script, and there is one near the entrance to each platform. Do not intimidated by the huge masses of jostling, rushing, cross people. The Russians also take their time to study the tiny signposts to see where to change trains or which exit to take. To find out in which direction a train is going, look at the signs at the platform or in the <b>front</b> window of the train - the one in the rear window may show the opposite direction. Avoid the Metro if you are claustrophobic since the air is thick, especially at rush hour. Most of the older train cars are not air-conditioned nor heated, so in the winter it might get quite chilly on several stretches where the track is above the ground.
The most interesting stations in terms of decor are <b>Komsomolskaya</b>, <b>Novoslobodskaya</b> and <b>Kievskaya</b> on the ring line, <b>Kropotkinskaya</b> on the red line, <b>Kievskaya</b>, <b>Arbatskaya</b> and <b>Ploschad' Revolyutsii</b> (there are lot of sculptures on sides of this station) on dark blue line, <b>Mayakovskaya</b> on the green line (watch out for the mosaics on the ceiling). The last one is also one of the deepest, which allowed it to be used as a makeshift assembly hall for a Party meeting marking the anniversary of the Revolution during the German bombardments in the winter of 1941.
Pay attention that there are several pairs or even triples of stations with same names located on different lines and connected by transfers. But there are also unique two pair of stations called <b>Smolenskaya</b> and <b>Arbatskaya</b> and they are <b>NOT</b> connected at all. Those on light blue line are among the first built 
stations in Metro (they were opened in 1935 with first Metro line).
Also you can take a look at architecture of ground entrance building of mentioned <b>Arbatskaya</b> station on light blue line (it's built like red star in plan) and <b>Krasnye Vorota</b> station on red line (it's like a giant portal protruding from underground).
Also there is an unique station in Metro that is located at bridge crossing Moscow River. This bridge also carries traffic road on higher level. There is beautiful view through transparent sides of station. This station is called <b>Vorob'evy gory</b> and located on red line. Great observing point around Moscow is located nearby on Vorob'evy hills.
Lomonosov Moscow State University main building is also located next to the
observation point.
The Metro is relatively safe, although pickpockets are a problem, as they are in any environment where a lot of people are pressed together. Opportunistic petty crime, such as snatching someone's mobile phone and jumping out just as the doors are closing, is also commonplace. Take the usual precautions at the night hours, when the crowds recede to avoid being the only passenger in a car with a gang of inebriated teenagers looking for an excuse to beat someone up.
There is no train guard or conductor, so the first car near the driver may be the safest.  Every car is equipped with an intercom to the driver's cabin; they are beige boxes with a grill and a black button near doors, and mostly work, unless visibly vandalized. If you find yourself in a dangerous situation, press the button and wait for the driver or his assistant to reply. The employee might not understand you but will know that there are problems and will pass the information on. At the next stop, someone (it could be even a bored on-duty policeman) might check in on the commotion.
Every large street in the city is served by at least one bus route. Many of these routes are doubled by the trolleybus routes. Also every large street of Moscow has trolley wires over it. Moscow buses and trollebuses go from 5:30 a.m. till 1:00 a.m. The average distance between bus stops is about 150 m (500 ft). <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.anaga.ru/travel/moscowtrans.htm#1">[17]</a>
As Metro stations outside the city centre are far apart in comparison to other cities, up to 4 km (2.5 mi), an extensive bus network radiates from each station to the surrounding residential zones. Even though they have one, buses and trolleybuses usually don't operate on a fixed schedule, mostly due to large Moscow jams, but there are always plenty of them around. Timetable can be observed better in out-of-jam hours, but beware, that in Russia even without any reason, being 5-10 ahead or behind schedule, or completely cancelling some trips at certain times, is common, especially late in the evening. In some directions, the amount of public transport may considerably reduce after 9pm though. Timetable for almost all routes of buses, trolleybuses and trams can be found here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://mosgortrans.org/pass3/">[18]</a> (in Russian), unfortunately this site is rarely updated and often contains out-of-date information (it is largely out-of-date as of September 2011). However it can give a feeling of frequency of various routes at different times of the day.
One trip costs 25 rubles, if you buy yellow "TAT" ticket at the booth at the bus stop. You can buy "TAT" tickets for 5, 11, 20, 40 or 60 rides for reduced price (valid for 90 days since purchase).  At the booth you can also buy and use "90 minutes" ticket (see "Metro" section for details). You can use "Ediny" and "Troika" e-wallet to pay for on-ground ride.   Tickets for bus, trolleybus and tram are unified. The information about the ticket costs is available here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://troika.mos.ru/tariffs/table/">[19]</a>. Note that driver sells only 4-ride "TAT" tickets for 100  RUB (valid 90 days) and green "90 minutes" tickets for 50 RUB. To validate magnet strip ticket (yellow TAT) insert it into validator as shown, to validate smart-card just put it on the validator's mark.
In early 1900s Moscow had an extensive electric tram system, which had firstly been opened in 1899. However as Metro was opened (May 1935) and the trolleybus appeared (November 1934), the tram network was radically reduced and the most of the tram routes became to be served by the trolleybuses. In particular, the B tram route to run around the Garden Ring, was changed by the B-trolleybus-route.
Now tram daily usage by the Muscovites is low (about 5%), although it still remains vital in some districts for those who need to get to the nearby Metro station. Tram fares are same as bus and trolleybus fares.  The tram routes and their time-table: <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.anaga.ru/travel/moscowtrans.htm#2">[20]</a>.
Marshrutka is a jitney-like mode of transport that falls between private transport and conventional buses. You will often find Marshrutka's following the same routes as conventional buses, and will follow the same numbering pattern. The role of the modern Russian marshrutka is basically similar to the minibus in other countries. It is similar to German Sammeltaxis, Mexican Peseros and American dollar vans. Trip costs can be different, depending on marshrutka line. Usually one trip costs 30 rubles. You give money to the driver after entering the minibus. If you need to get off, you have to shout: "ÐÑÑÐ°Ð½Ð¾Ð²Ð¸ÑÐµ Ð·Ð´ÐµÑÑ!" (Astanaviti zdes, meaning "Stop here!")<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.anaga.ru/travel/moscowtrans.htm#3">[21]</a>. You should shout it as loudly as possible, because the motor roar and the music sounding from the driverâs audio system muffle the passengers' voices. Sometimes the marsrutkers hang out an inscription: "Ð¢Ð¸ÑÐµ ÑÐºÐ°Ð¶ÐµÑÑ â Ð´Ð°Ð»ÑÑÐµ Ð²ÑÐ¹Ð´ÐµÑÑ", meaning "If you speak quietly, you'll travel far".
You should shout it in Russian, because generally the Marshrutka drivers speak only Russian, and since many of them came to Russia from Central Asia, they often even speak Russian poorly.
Generally marshrutkas go a little faster than buses: however they may be operated by reckless drivers and thus become dangerous. Unless you're in a hurry, more convenient buses/trolleys/trams are a safer option.
<b>NOTE:</b> Beware of unofficial taxis that like to hang around tourist areas. They use a taxi meter, however their meter goes by some made-up, unofficial rate. A 10 minute ride can easily cost between RUB2500-3000(close to $100), instead of RUB400.
<b>Make sure to negotiate on a fixed price beforehand. Or have your hotel order taxis for you.</b> There are now also a few apps for smartphones that allow you to order official taxis by your GPS location. Yandex Taxi and GetTaxi are popular ones.

In Russia and Moscow, the difference between hailing a cab and simply hitch-hiking is blurry. It is an old Russian tradition for drivers to offer rides to strangers, for a fee. For many Russians, it is like a second job {such drivers are usually called "Ð±Ð¾Ð¼Ð±Ð¸Ð»Ñ" (bombers)}. Generally, wherever you are, at any time of day or night, you can get a 'cab' in a matter of minutes or seconds by holding out your hand. Hold your hand out low by your hip, not up high as they hail cabs in American films.
Normally, you tell the driver where you're going and negotiate an amount with you naming the first price. For many locations, giving the closest Metro stop is the best plan of attack. If you don't like the amount one guy is charging, you'll doubtlessly find another driver in a minute or two. Sometimes when you tell the driver where you're going, he'll decide he's not going in that direction and drive off. Keep in mind, though, that very few drivers will speak English. It is not recommended to get in the car if the driver asks you "Dorogu pokazhesh?", meaning that he doesn't know the way himself (nevertheless it won't stop him from charging you a greater price).
The "bombers" staying near bus stops and subway stations usually charge higher prices than an accidental driver (as it's their job), however they seem to be a bit safer. Picking up and transporting passengers for a fee by non-taxi cabs is illegal in Moscow since April 2012 (however, it's the driver that gets nicked).
You should be able to get between most destinations within the Garden Ring for 200 rubles or less, unless it is a national holiday or when the metro is not working. For example, a typical charge for a New Year's Eve is not less than 500 rubles.
There are several taxi services operating in Moscow, the most noticeable on the streets being The New Yellow Taxi (<b>Novoye Zholtoye Taxi</b>). The cars are yellow Fords or Volgas (Russian car brand). They will charge the minimum rate of around 250 rubles no matter the distance. It is, however, possible to negotiate the price with the driver as well as he will basically switch off the meter and pocket the fare.
You can call a cab over the phone, too, but most Muscovites will do it only at night or to get to an airport. On some rare occasions phone taxi may be as bad as illegal as a street ride, but if you take your time researching in internet, you will find many registered taxi companies that offer completely safe and sound western-like services, some will even refuse to drive you if you don't wear seatbelt. Most western embassies will provide you with a list of tried and tested legit taxi companies that will send a cab to pick you up 24/7 anywhere in Moscow in a safe way at a decent price.
If you're not good in Russian, there are several English-speaking taxi services operating in Moscow.
If you do use a car to arrive in Moscow, it can be very time consuming and stressful to get around. The street system was never designed to accommodate even a fraction of the exploding population of vehicles; the traffic jams on the Sadovoye Ring often do not clear between the morning and the evening rush hours. Most roadways are in a constant state of disastrous disrepair. You will have to compete for every inch of space on the road (quite literally; the proper distance between the vehicles for a Muscovite is close to zero) with seasoned drivers in dented "Ladas" who know the tangle of the streets inside out and will not think twice before cutting you off at the first opportunity.
The drivers of the ubiquitous yellow "marshrutka" route taxis can seem to be nearly suicidal, and account for a significant percentage of all accidents, while buses stop, go and barge in and out of traffic at will, blissfully unaware of the surroundings. One bright spot is the relative dearth of the large 18-wheeler trucks on Moscow roads; they do ply the Ring Road, however. From time to time all traffic on major thoroughfares may be blocked by police to allow government officials to blow through unimpeded, sirens blaring. Another problem is parking.  There is very little of it. Even if there are cars parked, it doesn't mean its always legal; this would mean finding upon return a hefty fine (3000 rubles) or your car being towed ("evacuated"). Park as soon as you can at a safe place (your hotel, for example) and use public transit.
But if you managed to have driven in <a href="/en/Rome" title="Rome">Rome</a> or <a href="/en/Athens" title="Athens">Athens</a> before, then it's not that hard to get accustomed to Moscow traffic. Just don't try to cross the city during rush hours or you can be stuck for as long as 8 h in traffic jams. In the middle of the day it may take as long as 2-3 h to cross the city (and only 1 h by metro).
The safest and easiest time to drive, when the roads are relatively empty and you can reach your destination quite easily, are the following:
<b>Traffic jam information</b> Anyway, before planning the car trip in Moscow, it's always recommended to check one of the many traffic jam information websites. This way you can immediately see if it worth going by car or if it's better to use a metro. The most popular ones are Yandex Probki <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://probki.yandex.ru">[22]</a> and Rambler Probki <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://probki.rambler.ru">[23]</a>.
<b>Gas stations</b>: BP, Lukoil, Gazpromneft, Rosneft gas stations all have good quality gasoline.
The famous "Raketa" speed ferries, departing to destinations at the suburban beaches, were unfortunately decommissioned following the 2007 season.
There still exists the "river bus" system, in the fashion of the Venetian <i>vaporetti</i> - in the warmer months, of course, since the river is ice-bound most winters. The only regular route has 7 stops <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.russia-welcome.com/index.php?id=141">[24]</a>, from the quay near the Kievsky rail station, downstream through the centre, terminating at Novospassky bridge (about half a mile from Proletarskaya Metro), and back. Ferries (passengers only) depart about once hourly, every day; the fare is RUB400 <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://translate.google.com/translate?prev=hp&amp;hl=en&amp;js=n&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cck-ship.ru%2Findex.php%3Fcon_id%3Dcity&amp;sl=ru&amp;tl=en&amp;history_state0=">[25]</a>. The ride is a pleasant diversion on a hot summer day, as you float past the Kremlin walls and under the bridges, but don't rely on it for transportation.
Since 2009 you can make a trip across the Moskva River on the snow-white yachts of the fleet "Radisson Royal Hotel, Moscow"<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.radisson-cruise.ru/index_en.php">[26]</a>. New yachts-restaurants ("Ferdinand", "Bon Voyage", "Selebrity", "Capella" and "Skarlet") unlike other tourist yachts on the Moskva River do not stop navigation in winter: they can move on ice very smoothly so that the waiter can easily pour champagne in crystal glasses on a table. The huge panoramic windows protect passengers from bad weather and city noise. Typical river trip starts from Ukraina Hotel embankment and takes a cruise with duration of 2.5-3 hours with english/russian audio guide onboard.
There is also a short monorail line, running from VDNKh to Timiryazevskaya metro stations. The system is unified with metro since April 2013. The Moscow monorail is slower and does not run as frequently as the Metro (every 6 min at peak hours, 16 min rest of the time), opens later, and closes earlier. It is useful to get to the Ostankino Tower, or to get to the VDNKh exhibition centre from the Metro Silver (9) line.
A convenient way to get around the center is the newly opened (2008) <b>Hop On Hop Off</b> tour bus service operating in the historic city center of Moscow.  Buses go every 30 min in a loop around Moscow and stop in front of most of the major hotels. Live English speaking guides on board will answer all your questions. The price is 750 rubles for a ticket valid for 24 h, and you may board and disembark at any stop along the route as many times as you like.<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.hoponhopoff.ru/">[27]</a>
Less essential sites, but very worthwhile if you have the time, include:
A great way to orient yourself when you arrive in Moscow is to take the newly launched <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.freemoscowbus.com">Free Moscow Bus Tour</a> â +7 916 564 4274  email: info@freemoscowbus.com  This is a free tour sponsored by local Moscow businesses, volunteers and supported by the city of Moscow. Reserve on-line well in advance as it can fill up fast.
Moscow has many attractions, but many of them are not friendly to a non-Russian-speaker. English-language newspapers like <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.themoscowtimes.com">The Moscow Times</a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.elementmoscow.ru">Element</a>, <i>Moscow News</i> and others can help navigate towards English-language friendly attractions and services.
Moscow has two <b>circuses</b>, the Nikulin circus on Tsvetnoi Bulvar (metro Tsvetnoi Bulvar), and the new circus near the University. Tickets can be bought for as little as 200 rubles, and even these seats are good. Touts may be selling tickets outside and can save you a lot of queueing, and they'll speak more English than the ticket office. Sometimes they are selling tickets at the cover price, and sometime at twice the price. Ask and make sure before parting with your cash.
The <b>Obraztsov Puppet Theatre</b> at the very north part of the Garden Ring has performances during the winter in the evening. Everything is in Russian and meant for children, but the stories are simple and quite understandable even if you don't understand Russian. There is a small box in front of the building where a puppet appears every hour and does a performance. At 12 midday all of the puppets appear for a short but entertaining appearance.
The <b>Novaya Opera</b> (new opera) in the Hermitage gardens features operas mainly in Russian most evenings, starting at 19:00. Tickets are normally available from 200 rubles. Ticket office is open 12:00-15:00 and then again 16:00-19:00.
Make sure you visit a <b>Russian bathhouse</b> <i>(banya)</i> while in Moscow, as it's an important Russian tradition and Russians, especially 40+, go at least once a week. Have a hot steam, followed by a good whipping with birch branches. While its not the most pleasant experience, the benefits you'll receive afterward will enable you to understand why Russians are loyal to their banya. Most famous banya is the Sanduny (or Sandunovskaya banya).
Like any city with snowy winters, Moscow is a great place to go <b>ice skating</b>. Gorky Park is most famous but overcrowded and ice is not always in ideal condition; Bosco rink on a Red Square is glamorous and easy, although bit costly and not too favoured by advanced skaters. Luzhniki has arguably the best ice, although service can be tough and open hours are not always convenient. The winter rinks at Chistye Prudy or Izmaylovsky Park can be other alternatives.
An alternative way to explore Moscow is to get to know it from the inside, by walking and talking with locals and trying out local activities. Local residents can tell you a plenty of stories, show you some secret places (as roofs, courtyards, funcy eateries etc.) and will treat you as a friend.
Moscow remains the educational center of Russia and the former USSR. There are 222 institutes of higher education, including 60 state universities &amp; 90 colleges. Some of these offer a wide-spectrum of programs, but most are centered around a specific field. This is a hold-over from the days of the USSR, when Sovietwide there were only a handful of wide-spectrum "universities" and a large number of narrow-specialization "institutes" (mostly in Moscow &amp; St.Petersburg). Moscow offers some of the best business/management, science, &amp; arts schools in the world. Moscow is also a popular destination for foreign students to learn Russian.
You will need a work visa which is not an easy process. The visa needs to be arranged well in advance of travelling.
It is possible to work in Moscow, you just need to find a good company to support you.
Credit cards usage is becoming more and more widespread, but many cheaper stores and restaurants won't accept them, so cash is a necessity. Be sure to break your 5000 or 1000 RUB notes where you can, as the smaller merchants, street vendors and even many metro clerks will likely refuse them. While you are able to get some smaller vendors to accept U.S. dollars and Euros, it is always best to change currency, which is not a problem as currency exchange spots are everywhere, displaying the daily rates in large yellow letters. Read the terms carefully; even if the offer seems attractive, there may be a fixed-sum commission on top of it, or the advertised rate might apply only to large transactions (US$1,000 and up), while a less favourable one is in effect for smaller ones. Don't forget to check the change returned to you (the most common scam is to let a banknote "stick" inadvertently to the back of the little turnstile which the clerk is using to pass the money back and forth) and do not simply say yes to what you do not understand. A good approach to exchanging currency is to use bank ("ÐÐ°Ð½Ðº" in Russian) offices. There are lots of them in the centre of city (broadly defined as the inside of the Garden Ring). Better yet, use your own bank card from home at an ATM to draw money directly from your checking account, as the machines are almost all compatible with major Western money systems (Cirrus/MasterCard and PLUS/Visa) - not only you'll get a decent fixed bank rate, but also often a screen menu in friendly (albeit somewhat broken) English.
Buying souvenirs can be quite a chore if you do not stay in the centre of Moscow. You can get cheaper souvenirs from Izmaylovskiy Market in Izmalylovo Park. Walking out in the middle of a bargaining session will most likely NOT get you the price you want.
Generally, you can find different sized fully featured malls near almost every metro station, especially in residential areas.
There is a online shopping aggregator, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://market.yandex.ru">Yandex Market</a>, where it is possible to find lots of other goods.
Most tourists will find that going out to eat in Moscow is quite expensive. It does not have to be that way, it's just that the options most visible for the foreigner generally are.
There are a number of American franchise restaurants, such as McDonald's and TGI Friday's; it's a familiar, if boring eat at a reasonable price.
A huge and quickly growing range of restaurants, with a matching range of prices, has developed in Moscow. The average cost per person for a middle to top class restaurant will be $30 to $200 (more if one goes for vintage wines). A quick 'canteen' style meal in a 'Stolovaya' can cost about $3 and is generally underground, near famous monuments and subway stations. These large food courts sometimes also contain a small mall. They will usually include toilets but be prepared to pay around $1 to use them.  Lately a lot of new "middle-class" restaurants have opened, filled with families on weekends. The omnipresent McDonald's have outlets near many metro stations.
Non-chain restaurants and cafes promising "European and Caucasus cuisine" are equally bad in either one most of the time; seek a specialist single-region venue instead (Georgian, Russian, Italian, French etc).
Many small restaurants within the Sadovoye ring are now offering prix-fixe "business lunches" at around RUB200-250, for the teeming hordes of white-collars populating the neighbourhood during the day. These deals are valid in the middle of the day (12:00-15:00) and include a cup of soup or an appetizer, the main dish of the day (a smaller portion than if you order a la carte; sometimes there's even a limited choice), bread (no Russian eats anything without a slice) and a beverage (soda or coffee/tea; beer costs extra); it is a reasonably priced, freshly cooked quick meal in the middle of your wanderings which will tide you through to the evening.
Wait staff in Russia are not as dependent on tips for a big chunk of their pay as, say, in the US, so the expected amount is correspondingly less, and you generally will not be looked at with hidden malice even if you take all of the change brought back to you, but tipping is still encouraged. If your total is under 500 rubles, round it up to the nearest fifty; under 1000 - to the nearest hundred; from 1,000 to 1,500 a hundred-bill is appropriate. If you are going above that, 10% would be reasonably generous; in really swanky places, though, all bets are off. Don't tip in cafeteria-like settings, where you travel along the counter with a tray and pay at the cash register. Throw a couple of tens into the tip jar for baristas. Note: there is no way to leave a tip on the credit card - when you receive the slip for signature, there isn't a place to write the extra amount in, so keep enough small bills in your wallet.
<b>Azerbaijani</b> â Azerbaijani cuisine is probably the most popular in Moscow.You can find Azerbaijani restaurants everywhere in Moscow.It is strongly recommended if you want to try delicious food in Moscow.
<b>Armenian</b> - Similar to Turkish and Azerbaijani cuisine but with an exciting twist to it. Try out their mouth watering charcoal grilled kebabs and fish dishes. Many good restaurants available around Moscow and many of the chefs are actually natives from Armenia, which adds to the authenticity of the food. Try out Restaurant Gavan at the address: âulitsa Rossolimo 7, gorod Moskvaâ. Take metro to Park Kulâtury station, also not far away from the famous Gorky Park.
<b>Georgian</b> â Besides Russian cuisine, one variety of ethnic food that is strongly recommended while in Moscow is Georgian. This cuisine is generally spicier than Russian food, and there are a number of reasonably priced Georgian restaurants in Moscow.
<b>Japanese</b> â Muscovites have been obsessed with sushi since late 1990s, and the boom is not over yet. Japanese restaurants are probably most popular among young Russian women, easily competing with Italian and French restaurants.  The picture menus are a great help when ordering, and the names of items are basically just Japanese transliterated to Cyrillic. Don't expect a proliferation of raw fish, though; the most popular rolls contain cooked items.
<b>Thai</b> cuisine can be found only in few restaurants, and its authenticity is debatable.
<b>Vietnamese</b> and <b>Chinese</b> cuisines are not popular with Russians, but can be found if you search for it.
Free-standing street food is well represented with hot dogs/sausages, meat pastries and doner kebab (shawarma) kiosks (dwindling in numbers, though, as part of the mayor's quest for limiting immigrant businesses under the guise of sanitary enforcement). The latter are tasty, if not entirely authentic, but can be risky; pack Pepto-Bismol.
There are also several chains of outdoor stand-up food vendors, usually located in clusters around Metro stations.  A few to look for are:
Muscovites are also fond of their ice cream, consumed in any weather, even (proudly) in the dead of winter, cheap and usually of superior quality; kiosks can be found all over the center and near all Metro stations.
In these you take a tray, move along a counter with food (either taking the dishes yourself or asking the staff to give you a bowl of soup, a plate of vegetables etc.) and pay at the cash register at the end of the counter. <b>By far, this is the best choice of eating out on a budget in Moscow.</b> You eat fresh healthy food (and not hamburgers or any other fast food), you <b>don't</b> have to ponder how much tips is enough (because there's no one to tip, you just pay a fixed price at the cash register) and you don't need to be starving for 40 minutes while the chef is cooking your food (everything is cooked already).

Typical open hours are 10:00-22:00, but they differ in different restaurants of the chain, and a couple of them work virtually round clock (with only a break from 3:00 am to 5:00 am). A soup is 75-85 rubles ($2.5-3), many mains are less than 100 rubles ($3.5, but do look at the price tags -- there are much more expensive dishes as well). If your are wise enough not to drink (drinks are relatively more expensive here) and to look at the price tags, you will be full for 200-250 rubles ($7-9). <i>The author of these lines has lived in Moscow for 15 years, and eats in Moo-Moo himself when too lazy to cook at home (which is often), usually leaving around 200 rubles for a dinner without a drink.</i></span> &#160;<a class="listing-edit" href="#Moo-Moo" onclick="editListing('Moo-Moo', 'eat', 'Moscow');return false;" title="click to edit Moo-Moo" rel="nofollow">edit</a></span>

Another cheap option is fast food, a growing trend in Moscow. The likes of <b>McDonald's</b> and <b>KFC</b> are seen near almost every shopping mall.
There are several chains of restaurants that are now very widespread, and again are usually located near metro stations. The 1990 opening of <b>McDonalds</b> was an international event, and now it has over 70 outlets in Moscow.
There are several bars in central Moscow worth visiting.
<br />
Moscow has a good selection of tea saloons. Beyond them, high-quality infusion teas like Newby, are widely available in cafes, both packeted and loose.
Asking to add boiling water to the tea you ordered earlier is a practice that some cafes don't welcome, but normally it's acceptable. However, initiative from the waiter is really rare in this respect.
According to Vedomosti (March 2009), best coffee can be found in:
Other places:
There is a big need for mid-range accommodations in Moscow, and the curious traveler can find some good ones -- with a little diligence.
Moscow historically enjoyed a low crime rate. However, Moscow is a booming metropolis, so common sense should be used. Avoid dark alleys - like you would anywhere else.  Check the advice from your Foreign Office for entry requirements, health, safety, local laws and customs.
Do keep in mind, that while traveling in Moscow, as in the rest of Russia, you must always have your passport with you. If you look non-white, your papers may get checked more often than usual.
Usually, the police will demand to see your papers to check if you have been registered within seven business days (used to be three business days up to March 25th, 2011) of your arrival into Moscow. Always remember that if you stay in a hotel then you are automatically registered and will be handed a confirmation paper at a time of check-in, so no worry in this case. Most policemen do not speak a word of English, but they will let you know if your papers are not in order and you must go with them to the police precinct. In any case, if you are a decent looking person (regardless of race and nationality) odds to be asked to show documents are minuscule, and the police are usually looking for migrants from Central Asia.
Also note that in winter months, streets in Moscow can get very slippery. Take a pair of grippy shoes or, even better, boots (to prevent twisted ankles) and a waterproof raincoat. Take care as ice patches are often hard to spot, even when they appear to have been cleared or melted. Wearing non-grippy shoes could result in injury.
Downtown Moscow is very brightly lit, and a lot of the wide roads have underground pedestrian walkways.  Those are well lit too - so you shouldn't worry about going down inside them.  But of course, like anywhere else, do use common sense, and keep an eye out for pickpockets.  Use the pedestrian crossings to cross the street, as traffic can get pretty crazy sometimes.
In Moscow there are three main GSM operators (MTS, Beeline, Megafon), and they often have offers that give you a SIM card for free or at least very cheap. If you are planning to stay a while and to keep in touch with Russian people, then you should consider buying a local pay-as-you-go SIM card instead of going on roaming. Almost any European phone, and those from the U.S. which work on a GSM network (T-Mobile, or AT&amp;T), carry the "tri-band" or "World phone" designation and had been unlocked, should work on the Russian standard (if yours is not one of those, a basic new candybar will still run you considerably less than $40 without a contract). If you buy a SIM card from a shop you'll need your passport for identification. It only takes five minutes to do the paperwork and it will cost less than $10. You will receive a number in the "mobile" area code, starting with 9, which has more expensive rates for calls to and from landlines (and from abroad; in compensation, the tariffs for calls to phones on the same network are usually reduced), and your card will be preloaded with a small initial minute allowance. Incoming calls are free. Top off at the stores of your chosen company, at shops selling phones, or at newer automated kiosks which accept utility payments (they look like short, squat ATMs with large touchscreens, and display, among others, logos of the mobile operators); the latter charge a small commission fee and accept cash or (rarely) credit cards. Be careful when entering the number: it is possible to add airtime to any phone, not only your own.
For calls abroad there are different inexpensive pre-paid cards (e.g. Arktel), which you can find at many shops and kiosks throughout the city or in any post office.
BeelineWiFi (former GoldenWiFi, acquired by Beeline ) is the largest network of Wi-Fi access points, available almost everywhere within a Third Ring Road and a Garden Ring, less frequently outside it. Most of them are free (paid by the venue, e.g. a cafe or mall) - whenever you are at a cafe, ask your waiter for a free WiFi pass slip if your device doesnt connect automatically. Very few require an account. Rates are 50 rubles for an hour, 100 rubles for 24 hours, 500 rubles for 30 days; if you have a credit card, it's a fairly simple process completed entirely online - you are presented with the payment choice screen as soon as you connect. Airports are flooded with the paid access, so as to drown the (few) free choices. In some places, pre-paid cards can be acquired at the cashier's desk (e.g. Starbucks) or in outlets selling mobile phones.  Gorky Park also has free Wi-Fi access points.
McDonalds has free (as in a 30-minute voucher with every meal) Wi-Fi in nearly every other of their locations in the city (and in most of them within a Garden Ring)âoperated also by BeelineWiFi.
Look out for "Free WiFi" sign in most of the malls. At least one free-for-all WiFi spot is located in "Respublika" bookstore on Tverskaya near Mayakovskaya metro - you can use it without limits as long as you're about 15 meters from the store's entrance. Benches are provided and often packed with people.
Free Wi-Fi is also available on the Ring line (Brown) of the Moscow metro.
There is also a 4G LTE provider called Yota <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.yota.ru/en/">[120]</a> available in Moscow and some other cities. You can buy their USB modem in almost every outlet selling mobile phones (Euroset, Svyaznoi, I-on etc.) as well as in any computer related store. The price of the modem is 2900 rubles. You can use it for free for 7 days, after you should select your tariff on their site (<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://my.yota.ru/">https://my.yota.ru/</a>) suggested in English as well. To switch the language, click "EN" on the top. The advantage of this operator is that you can change your tariff at any time without paying. You just choose another tariff using the scroll bar, and the amount of days will be changed according to your current payment, the speed will increase. Also Megafon currently offers 4G (LTE) connections.
The 3G(HSDPA) coverage is also available in most areas provided by MegaFon, MTS, BeeLine. There is also a CDMA (EV-DO rev. A) wireless internet available provided by Skylink <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.skylink.ru">[121]</a> but you have to buy their hardware (450Mhz) like USB modem for 1890 rub to use it (runs at 450MHz and it's not compatible with CDMA equipment used in the U.S. etc.).
Moscow is one of the global diplomatic capitals, competing with <a href="/en/Berlin" title="Berlin">Berlin</a>, <a href="/en/Paris" title="Paris">Paris</a>, <a href="/en/London" title="London">London</a>, and <a href="/en/Washington,_D.C." title="Washington, D.C.">Washington D.C.</a>. Most countries have embassies in the city.
Since Moscow is the biggest transportation centre in Russia and one of main the points of entry for the foreign tourists, it is a convenient starting point for exploring much of European Russia. Even travelling through Moscow to Ukraine and some Caucasian and Central Asian countries (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan etc.) could be cheaper than direct flights from Europe/North America. Travel deals to Moscow are not rare and ticket prices are often pretty low within the former USSR.
