<b>Guilin</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.visitguilin.org/">[1]</a> (æ¡æ; GuÃ¬âlÃ­n) is a city in <a href="/en/North_Guangxi" title="North Guangxi">North Guangxi</a>, <a href="/en/China" title="China">China</a>. Guilin is a scenic town and one of the best-known tourist destinations in China. There are many scenic places within short traveling distance of Guilin. These include <a href="/en/Longsheng" title="Longsheng">Longsheng</a> with its famous Longji rice terraces; the Lijiang River, a scene of which is printed on the back of <a href="/en/Xingping" title="Xingping">Â¥20 bank notes</a>; <a href="/en/Yangshuo" title="Yangshuo">Yangshuo</a>, a small county downstream from Guilin; and much more. This makes Guilin an excellent base for exploring the northern end of Guangxi Province.
Guilin is a beautiful city. The town center is surrounded by two rivers and four lakes and studded with sheer sided karst mountains. Outside the city center, the buildings are less well kept. The main industry in the city is tourism so the city is much cleaner than other Chinese cities.
Guilin itself is like most other medium size Chinese cities, other than that it has a large number of western-style hotels, tourists and is relatively free of air pollution. Many Chinese domestic tourists also flock to this area. What makes it special is its proximity to many picturesque limestone mountains and formations.
Separated from the center of China and the Yangtze River basin by the Nan Mountains, Guangxi has always been distinct from the rest of China. The Han Chinese empire first expanded into Guangxi in the 2nd century BC. The Ling Canal was cut around the time, allowing small boats to transit from the Yangtze to the south flowing Xi River via the Xiang River.
Trade grew along the canal and river routes. Guilin was founded as a trading post in the 1st century BC on the West bank of the Kuei River. During the Ming dynasty, a garrison was set up in Guilin and the surrounding area gradually civilised with the development of farmland. The city had a population of over two million at the time of the Second World War, but was utterly destroyed during the war. The population slowly recovered with post-war construction of several factories for the production of paper, chemicals and agricultural equipment. However, market forces have caused several of these industries to relocate out of Guilin.
Guangxi and Guilin are home to 12 different ethnic minorities besides the Han Chinese. Guangxi is an autonomous region for the Zhuang ethnic group, rather than a province. See <a href="/en/List_of_Chinese_provinces_and_regions" title="List of Chinese provinces and regions">List of Chinese provinces and regions</a>. Various other minorities, such as the Dong, are also found in the area.
Guilin is the third largest city in Guangxi, after Nanning and Liuzhou.

Book air ticket early as the price will increase as it approaches your traveling day. At off season, air ticket may be cheaper than train ticket (even the hard sleeper price), it is worth a try to check the difference.

Airport bus to town is &#165;20, but drops just south of the city centre at the Aviation Hotel where you can find taxis waiting. From the airport, a Taxi should then be around &#165;100 to most hotels in the city center (taxi drivers refuse to go by meter, which would be significantly cheaper). Many hotels arrange for a "shuttle" (in practice, a taxi). The airport bus only leaves when full-ish so there may be a wait as the bus fills up.
Back to the airport, a hotel may arrange the trip for &#165;80.
Guilin has two train stations. <b>Guilin Station</b> (<i>Guilin Zhan</i>) is in the centre of town on Zhongshan Nanlu while <b>Guilin North Station</b> (<i>Guilin Bei Zhan</i>) is far away from downtown area. Most, but not all, trains which originate/terminate in Guilin go to or come from Guilin North while trains which come through Guilin from elsewhere usually only go to Guilin Station and not Guilin North.
There are trains from North (Beijing, Changsha, Wuhan, Shanghai, Xian), West (Kunming), South (Liuzhou, Nanning, Zhanjiang), and East (Guangzhou, Shenzhen).
Once you get out of the train station, you will be approached by cab drivers/other drivers alike. While their cab meters are trustworthy, they might use a few tricks to cheat you out of some RMB, for example, aggressively pushing tours or adding false charges to the tab.
There are some expressways locally and within the province, however for any long distance journey, it is a two lane road.

Getting a local map from a tourist guide or shop for Â¥5 is a good idea. This will show the location of most of the sights as well as details of bus routes. Buses are an ideal way to get around Guilin on a budget. Many city parks and river spots can be accessed easily by bus. All the buses starting with 5# are free. A useful one is bus 58 which runs from the train station (and bus station) to many of the attractions. Bus fare are capped at Â¥2 per trip.
Taxis are also inexpensive and easily hailed within the city. Usually hard to catch during peak hours (5:30PM-7PM).

Most hotels or hostels arrange this service, also telling the driver where you want to go if one is not capable of speaking Chinese.

There is a big underground bazaar running from the train station all the way to the bus station selling clothes, footwear, accessories, bags, and many more. The second underground market is located underneath the city center selling food, bags, mobile phones and other electronic devices. Remember to bargain if prices are not openly displayed.
Branded luxury goods can be purchased from the departmental stores near Cross Street. Suncome has many branches throughout the city selling everyday necessities.
There is also a street market set up along Zhongshan Lu at night selling typical tourist trinkets.
Guilin cuisine is a combination of Cantonese and Hunanese styles, but with more use of fish and spicies and often prepared using stir-frying or steaming.  Restaurants often assume westerners do not like spicy food and will make your food bland as hell if you do not insist otherwise. Even then there is a chance they will not believe you.
Guilin has some distinct local <b>ingredients</b> used in a number of dishes.
As many other Chinese cities, Guilin has its own <b>snacks</b>.
A number of Guilin <b>dishes</b> are unique to the city or are especially wellknown here.
Restaurants can be found throughout the city.  There are various eateries near the train station selling cheap and simple but delicious local dishes.  There are many restaurants around the main streets, Jiefang Road and along the river, but many of them are either overpriced chains and/or tourist traps and the food they serve is less than authentic. Do not be fooled by them being crowded, they are not worth the money. A better option may be to wander the side streets.
There are a few clusters of restaurants worth exploring.
