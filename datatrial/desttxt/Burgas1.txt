Burgas is generally safe city. However some common sense guidelines should be kept in mind when you travel especially in summer.
In summer the pickpocketing is more common because a lot of pickpockets from the country come to take advantage of the tourists. Keep your money and purse close by. Do not leave your property unattended. 
Often beggars approach foreigners and ask for money. The best will be to pretend that you do not understand what they want and walk away. If they keep on following you â get into a shop or sit inside a cafÃ© to have a drink until they leave you alone. Alternatively if they still don't go, try to speak to a security guard in the shop, cafÃ© or bank.
There are a number of scam-taxi drivers in summer. Double check the tariff when you get into a taxi. 
When you exchange money, double check the rates, ask if there are any taxes and basically the best will be to ask a few times how much Bulgarian leva you will get for your foreign currency. The normal exchange rate for 1 euro is 1,94 leva. You should be very desperate to exchange under that level, but never allow exchange rate under 1,85 leva.
Be aware of people approaching you on the street offering good exchange rates or anything else. 
At night avoid speaking too loudly and avoid poorly-lit areas, especially in the Sea Garden. 
Avoid conflicts with drunken people. In summer the Sea Garden and the beach are full of cafÃ©s and bars and people who drink sometimes way too much and are quick to start confrontations. Stay away from situations like this.
Be wary of people offering you a taste of cherries or other fruits in the street. It is not free and if you taste you will be physically pushed to buy an entire bucket, usually at a very high price. Ignore them and say no firmly.
The Southern Black Sea coastal line has suffered heavily from the construction boom of holiday resorts and complexes from the 2000 â 2008 period. As alternative to the traditional summer vacation there are a few campsites situated on picturesque beaches in the Burgas region. For travelers without cars - most of them are accessible by public transport to the main village and then by walk or hitchhike.
