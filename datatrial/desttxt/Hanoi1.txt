<b>Hanoi</b> (Vietnamese: <i>HÃ  Ná»i</i>), the capital of <a href="/en/Vietnam" title="Vietnam">Vietnam</a>, and also its second largest city, is a fascinating blend of East and West, combining traditional Sino-Vietnamese motifs with French flair. It is largely unscathed from the decades of war, and is now going through a building boom, making it a rapidly developing city in <a href="/en/Southeast_Asia" title="Southeast Asia">Southeast Asia</a> Hanoi.
Invading forces from every direction agree: Hanoi makes a fine capital. It has held that title for more than a thousand years, through several invasions, occupations, restorations, and name changes. The Chinese conquered the imperial city of Thang- Long in 1408 and renamed it Tá»ng BÃ¬nh. Le Loi repelled the invaders in 1428 and ascended the throne, becoming known as LÃª ThÃ¡i Tá» (é»å¤ªç¥); for his efforts, a slew of legends about his heroic exploits, many centred around the <b>Hoan Kiem Lake</b> in the Old Quarter.
The Nguyen Dynasty gave the city its modern name of Ha Noi in 1831, but they had transferred power to <a href="/en/Hue" title="Hue">Hue</a> by then; it remained there until 1887, when the French made Saigon and then Hanoi the capital of all French Indochina. It changed hands again in 1954, when it was ceded to Ho Chi Minh and the Viet Minh after almost a decade of fighting, and it became the capital of North Vietnam; Saigon was the rival in South Vietnam. Upon reunification in 1976, it assumed that title for the entire country.
The first institution of learning in Vietnam, Quoc Tu Giam, was founded here in the 11th century. Nine hundred years later, the first western-style universities in Vietnam were also founded in Hanoi. The city is one of the leading centres of scientific study and research in the country. Hanoi retains much of its older charm of bygone eras, despite the battles that have raged over it; conflict had the side effect of making it largely oblivious to modern architecture, and as a result, few buildings in the city centre area are higher than five stories. The Old Quarter is second only to <a href="/en/Hoi_An" title="Hoi An">Hoi An</a> for uninterrupted stretches of colonial and pre-colonial architecture, well-preserved on dense warrens of narrow, wonderfully atmospheric streets. It trades the commercial boom and sprawl of <a href="/en/Ho_Chi_Minh_City" title="Ho Chi Minh City">Ho Chi Minh City</a> in the South for a more understated charm, worth enjoying for an extra day or two, and with countless transport options and travel agents, it makes a perfect base for exploration of the North.
As you walk along the street, you may find that people start talking to you. It is a cultural norm there to make conversation with strangers. They might ask you where you are from and other general questions. It takes awhile to get used to that. However, there are times when you find this friendliness extremely helpful, such as when you are lost or need help.
The <b>Tourist Information Centre</b>, â +84 4 926 3366, Dinh Tien Hoang, just north of Hoan Kiem Lake, can provide a fairly useful map although bewilderingly, the blow-up of the Old Quarter is missing, making it useless in that part of town. The Centre also offers as well as limited free internet and English-language advice albeit, they aren't without bias.
There are self-help interactive screen information booths around the Old Quarter but their purpose is to superficially conjure an image of coming-of-age "Vietnam has arrived" impression to the unsuspecting passer-by. An example was an inquiry typing out the American Embassy as prompted by an empty field, then it flashed on to the next interactive page asking for which district (one may not be aware that the US embassy has branches in every district) - smart and amazing!
The climate is tropical, with wet and hot weather much of the year. But due to the city's latitude, temperatures drop drastically in the wintertime and the wind chill and dampness means winter weather can feel cold. If possible, avoid the summer months of June - August, as the city turns into a sweltering sauna with little to no wind.
<b>Departure tax</b><br />
As of Nov 2006, international departure taxes should be included in the price of your ticket, but that doesn't necessarily mean they will be - check with the airline to be absolutely sure. If not, the tax (sometimes called "passenger service charge") is payable in US dollars (US$14) or in dong.
Most people arrive at the <b>Noi Bai International Airport (HAN)</b>, 35 km (45-60 minutes) north of the city. The airport might seem relatively small considering Hanoi's importance to the country, but this might benefit travellers by making the airport easy to navigate and no need to arrive hours in advance (the limited waiting space is one reason why non-travellers are discouraged from entering the airport) to make sure there is plenty of room for those actually using and working in the airport. Several airlines run flights from Noi Bai, including:
If <b>departing</b> from Noi Bai airport via Vietnam Airlines with no checked luggage, walk to the last airline check-in counter and to the right of it, there's a sign showing check-in for passengers without checked luggage. Using this counter is a great time-saver if it applies to your journey.
There are a few official looking tourist information booths inside the arrival hall (as of July 2012), offering rides into the city for US$25-35 per car and telling you not to take the cheaper taxis outside because of various scams. To sum things up, taking a fixed-price taxi from one of the companies outside of the arrival hall is the best deal to get a taxi to your destination, although you might have to spend a few minutes insisting on actually going there on the occasions described above.
Trains to <a href="/en/Nanning" title="Nanning">Nanning</a>, <a href="/en/China" title="China">China</a> depart from <b>Gia Lam</b> Station (GPS 21.05213,105.87939), about 5km north-east of Hanoi Station, although tickets can be purchased from Hanoi Station.  A ticket for a soft sleeper compartment (4-berth compartment)  costs 568,000 dong per person. Be cautious buying these tickets from hotels or travel agents in the Old Quarter, as they may quote prices substantially higher. If you are taking the evening train out of Nanning, you will arrive at Gia Lam very early in the morning. Be sure to change some of your money at the border so you can get a cab to take you to the city when you arrive in Gia Lam. Exchange the rest of your money for a better rate in the city the next day.
All other trains use the main <b>Hanoi train station</b> (Ga Hang Co, 120 Le Duan, â +84 4 825 3949), for daily services from cities in the south including <a href="/en/Hue" title="Hue">Hue</a> and <a href="/en/Nha_Trang" title="Nha Trang">Nha Trang</a>. The <b>Reunification Express</b> goes all the way to <a href="/en/Ho_Chi_Minh_City" title="Ho Chi Minh City">Ho Chi Minh City</a>, although there is very little 'express' about it.
There are also train services to the north-west (including <a href="/en/Lao_Cai" title="Lao Cai">Lao Cai</a>, from which you reach <a href="/en/Sapa" title="Sapa">Sapa</a>. To board trains bound for these destinations, you have to enter the railway station compound through the "backdoor" at <b>Tran Quy Cap station</b>. Just tell your driver which destination your train is heading to. Be mindful of any "helpful" stranger who offers to carry your luggage - he probably has a sum more than the cost of the ticket in mind for the help.
Tickets for all destinations are sold in the main station, though there are two counter halls, north and south, serving the respective destinations.
Technically, there is a queuing system in place to buy tickets at Hanoi Station which involves obtaining a numbered docket and waiting to be called up to one of the ticket counters. In practice, the process is chaotic and many locals disregard the system altogether, often pushing their way to the counters to be served (Update April 2013; nobody uses the cue anymore; instead go straight up to counters or you will be waiting around for hours). If travelling to Nanning, China, it is advisable to ask a staff member where to go, as not all counters can sell these tickets.
Buy your tickets as early as possible, especially since sleeper-tickets can be sold out several days in advance. If you can't get a ticket any more, try a travel-agent who still might have stocks. You may also try your luck in the station just before boarding time, agents still holding tickets will be eager to sell as the departure draws near. Nevertheless, travel agencies in Hanoi are known for their bad business practices. Some of them will try to overcharge you up to 300%, so it is better go to the train station by yourself and find out about the prices before you agree on any deal.
If you have very rigid travel dates, are travelling on a public holiday, or can't be bothered to head down to the train station before your train you can book tickets online before you come to Vietnam. Tickets to LaoCai/Sapa can be booked at the fansipan website<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://fansipantrain.com/">[26]</a>. For all other tickets, Vietnam Impressive <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.vietnamimpressive.com/">[27]</a> is a reliable agency.
Public buses serving southern destinations (e.g. <a href="/en/Ninh_Binh" title="Ninh Binh">Ninh Binh</a>, 2h - VND 60,000) leave from Giap Bat <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://maps.google.de/maps?q=Nh%C3%A0+Ngh%E1%BB%89+Xu%C3%A2n+Ho%C3%A0ng,+827+Gi%E1%BA%A3i+Ph%C3%B3ng,+Gi%C3%A1p+B%C3%A1t,+Ho%C3%A0ng+Mai,+H%C3%A0+N%E1%BB%99i,+Vi%E1%BB%87t+Nam&amp;hl=de&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=20.981155,105.841169&amp;spn=0.010879,0.01929&amp;sll=20.980434,105.842232&amp;sspn=0.0058,0.009645&amp;t=h&amp;gl=de&amp;hq=Nh%C3%A0+Ngh%E1%BB%89+Xu%C3%A2n+Ho%C3%A0ng,+827+Gi%E1%BA%A3i+Ph%C3%B3ng,">[28]</a> bus station. To get from the Giap Bat bus station to the old quarter and Hoan Kiem Lake, leave aside all the hassle of taxi and motorbike drivers and simply take public bus number 8 towards ÄÃ´ng Má»¹ (VND 3,000, pay on the bus) - to find it head towards the main road inside Giap Bat station, you will see signs with numbers indicating the stops of different bus lines.
Most of the "open-tour" bus itineraries either begin or end in Hanoi, with <a href="/en/Hue" title="Hue">Hue</a> the next (or previous) stop (12-14 hr, US$8-9), and from there to <a href="/en/Hoi_An" title="Hoi An">Hoi An</a>, <a href="/en/Nha_Trang" title="Nha Trang">Nha Trang</a>, <a href="/en/Dalat" title="Dalat">Dalat</a>, <a href="/en/Mui_Ne" title="Mui Ne">Mui Ne</a>, <a href="/en/Ho_Chi_Minh_City" title="Ho Chi Minh City">Ho Chi Minh City</a>, and other cities in <a href="/en/Vietnam" title="Vietnam">Vietnam</a>, depending on the bus company. Most seem to stop at their office which could be right next to the old district / most backpacker hotels. Check when booking ticket.
Many of the same companies also sell tickets to <a href="/en/Vientiane" title="Vientiane">Vientiane</a> and <a href="/en/Savannakhet" title="Savannakhet">Savannakhet</a> in <a href="/en/Laos" title="Laos">Laos</a> (US$16-18). Do some research before you buy a ticket as rattle-trap scam buses abound on this route.

<b>Taxis</b> are the best way to travel long distances, but the <b>cyclos</b>, or pedicabs, are a cheap way to make shorter trips. Taxi fares are not always consistent, and the rates for each taxi company have not been standardized. For lone travellers, rides on the back of <b>motorbikes</b> (actually low-powered scooters) are popular too (known as <i>xe om</i>, literally meaning motorbike-hug).
Some meter taxi owners in Hanoi will attempt to negotiate a flat fee in advance rather than use the meter. If you have a fair idea of how far you're going or how much you're willing to pay, this is probably a good idea. If the driver refuses, turning around and walking away will almost certainly change his mind. Don't sweat it, it's all part of the expected negotiation protocol. It has also become common for the drivers of some of the less reputable taxi companies to "fix" their meters to run faster hence running up a high bill very fast! The recommendation is to only use the reputable and reliable taxi companies. These are Hanoi Taxi, â +84 4 3853 5353), Taxi CP,  â +84 4  3826 2626), Mai Linh Taxi , â +84 4 3861 6161). Another common scam by taxis is that the driver takes you for a "sightseeing" - and extends the tour to make more money. This is very hard to discover unless you know the city well, but if you catch your driver doing this (e.g. going around Hoan Kiem Lake twice), demand that he stop the taxi and leave the taxi without paying.
Be very careful with meter taxis in Hanoi. Meters have been known to operate "normally" initially, but after you've let your guard down, it jumps to astronomical amounts just before the destination. Some have central locking, and are known to lock passengers in, and demand large amounts of US dollars before letting them go. The driver may threaten to have you beaten up or arrested should you not give in to his demands, but if you kick up enough of a fuss, they will let you go.
Most taxi drivers speak limited English, so it's a good practice to get your hotel to write the name and address of you destination in Vietnamese to show the taxi driver, and get your hotel's business card in case you get lost.
You can hire a private car for full day at 40 usd. Ask hotels or any <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://vietnamhanoitravel.com/tour/hanoi-city-tour"><b>agency</b></a> to do that.
Be vigilant when taking a taxi - driver jumps out at destination and dumps most of your bags out of the trunk. While you're busy putting rucksack on he has taken off with your other bags.
Be vigilant also  the  meter which  can  run as far or  even faster than a  digital clock. A 10 min drive can rack up almost USD30 in downtown Hanoi alone! Do  keep an  eye on the meter during  the  journey. Fare flag drops starting at 12,000 dong. Bottom line: Stick to the reliable taxi companies listed above to avoid scams.
Motorbike drivers can be found on virtually every corner, especially in the Old Quarter. Expect to be offered a ride every half-block (or more). You should absolutely negotiate a fare in advance, and again, turn around and walk away if you don't like their offer. There are far more drivers than tourists, and they know it - your fare could be the only one they get all day. You should also write down the negotiated fare (with all zeros) to avoid confusion. Even if you do speak Vietnamese, a driver might pretend that you said 50,000 dong instead of 15,000, In case of argument over fares after the ride, keep calm and repeat the original agreement (remember, you have the leverage). A typical 10 min fare should cost no more than 15,000-20,000 dong. Many drivers will accept US dollars as well. At the end of a ride, some will offer to hang around to drive you to your next destination - either be clear that you don't want a return ride (and don't go near him when you leave), or get a price in advance. Otherwise, you might be surprised when the driver tacks on several million dong for having waited.
Keep your wallet out of arms reach of the drivers when you pay, less honest motorbike drivers are not adverse to grabbing your wallet and helping themselves to any notes they like the look of before jumping on their bike and speeding off.
Negotiate first or avoid using the <b>cyclos</b> services, they can demand 200,000 dong (US$10) for a short ride of less than 100 m (330 ft). At the end of the journey, a few men will come over to translate, and they will pretend to help and later insist that you pay the demanded amount.
Be aware that it is common for cyclo drivers to agree to a price, then take you to a different place, pretend to be confused and hit you up for more money when you reach your destination.
If you chose to travel by Cyclo, be clear on your destination, negotiate your fee first (100,000 Dong is more than fair for a 30-34 minute ride in any direction), be willing to get out and walk away (if your driver tries any monkey business), also be willing to walk away at the end of the journey if the driver won't stand by your original agreed price.
Motorcycles can be rented for around US$5-6 a day, and can be arranged by most hotels. A typical bike will be given with 1 litre of fuel, so top up at the nearest petrol kiosk. Queue up with the other bikes, unscrew your fuel cap and hand over your money (1 USD per litre) to the attendant who will top up your bike for you.
This is good for making lots of trips around the city for individuals or duos, but be careful: Hanoi is a great place to sharpen motorbike skills, provided you emerge alive. Park on the sidewalk with other bikes, and be sure to lock the front wheel. Locals will help arrange the bikes near their stores.  Many shops that have bike attendants will give you a ticket in exchange for parking your bike.  This may or may not come with a fee (typically ranging from 2,000-5,000 dong). However, parking at Hoan Kiem lake on a weekend can go up to 10,000 dong. The ticket will either have your license plate number written on it, or the ticket itself will be numbered, with that number subsequently chalked somewhere on your bike.  In such cases (where you've been given a ticket), the attendants may ask that you NOT lock the steering column or front wheel of your bike so that they can rearrange the bikes as customers come and go.
Riding outside the city is a refreshing change. Winding through the alleys and through the local markets inaccessible by cars allows you to see Hanoi from a different perspective. Google maps are rather useless once you leave the city due to the number of small lanes, forked roads and roundabouts that do not show up on the map. Stop and ask locals for directions, so be sure to brush up on the correct pronunciation of your destination!
Motorcycles can be purchased and sold by foreigners. Many travelers opt to buy their own bike and drive it throughout the country. A lot of drivers prefer to start in Hanoi and drive to Saigon as popularized by the British "Top Gear" series (though they did it the other way round and swapped to the train for the second half). Many people are unsure about the legality of purchasing bikes in Vietnam. Technically it is illegal for foreigners to own bikes in Vietnam without the proper documentation. However, this law is not enforced and thousands flock to Vietnam annually to buy bikes and ride them all over the country. It is possible to convert your driving license from your home country to a Vietnamese license, but few people go through this trouble. It is a well-known fact among riders that the police in Vietnam are highly unlikely to carry out routine traffic stops on foreigners. As long as the driver cares for his or her own safety and the safety of other motorist they can go the entire trip without hassles. Most vendors do not sell bikes they only rent them. There are some trusted companies selling bikes in Hanoi with good track records.
Scam free, cheap but a bit difficult to comprehend at first, the <b>buses</b> in Hanoi are relatively fast and surprisingly comfortable. Pick up a map with printed bus lines at the Trang Tien street (the book street by the Opera house) and spend a few minutes to identify the over 60 bus lines, find your bus stop, wait for the bus, pay 5,000 dong and off you go. If you are unfamiliar with the city, make sure to inform the mostly helpful conductor where you want to get off.

Hanoi's traffic is chaotic, with seemingly perpetual traffic jams, and a large number of almost suicidal motorcyclists and pedestrians. As such, driving yourself around is not recommended and because the International Driver's License is not allowed in Vietnam, and you should leave your transportation needs in the hands of professionals.

If you want to do some mild weight training on a budget, head to 88 Hang Buom St, a short walk from Hoan Kiem Lake. The cost is 30,000 dong per session as of Dec 2012. Locals apparently pay 130,000 dong/month. Be aware, however, that the gym is in very poor condition. The floor is hazardous and no one will spot you whilst benching so ensure you are able to place the bar back on the stand with your last repetition or go with a friend. The front of the gym is full of scooters and the rear wall has pictures of Uncle Ho exercising back in the day! Drinks are 10,000 dong.

Money changers are usually in most guest houses and banks, and they give bad rates. Don't exchange money from the black market people on the streets. The best place to exchange money is at Ha Trung road and Hang Bac where they give real good rates. Just walk into the gold shops or jewellery shops and ask them if they change money and ask to show their rates. Ask up to nearly 5 or more shops to see which shop gives the best rates. Best rates are at Ha Trung which is 15-25 mins walk West from Hoan Kiem lake. Look for Hang Da Market on the pedestrian map.Its a short street of Gold traders, and small sewing factories.Correct as at Feb 25th 2013.
Inside the Noi Bai airport arrival hall, there are several money changer booths of major local banks; unlike in many airports, their exchange rate is competitive (around +/-1% to mid-market for USD) and do not seem to differ from the rate in the city offices (which you won't find at Old Quarter anyway). Besides US dollar and euro, they will change currencies of major Asian countries; that may come handy if you come from (or was traveling in) these countries. Rate vary slightly between the banks, so you may like to shop around and to see what you will get.
ATMs are everywhere and cash is king here. There is a transaction limit (2,000,000 dong). For a higher transaction limit (4,000,000 dong) try the ANZ and Techcombank. The Techcombank SE of the Hoa Lo Prison allows transactions of at least 7 mil (didn't try more than this, so try starting as high as possible, maybe 20 mil?). The Citi bank machine in the shopping plaza on Xuan Dieu will dispense 6 mil. Many places will accept USD as well.
Check exchange rates daily. Jewellery shops will consistently offer a better rate than banks or hotels.
Since the mid 90s, Vietnamese cuisine has grown in quality and variation, and is now very diverse and most delicious. Most famous remains 'Pho Ga' (chicken noodle soup) or 'Pho Bo'(Beef noodle soup). There are various dishes including chicken, beef, fish and seafood, and there are hundreds, if not thousands, of restaurants nowadays in Hanoi catering to everyone's taste. Hanoi street food become a cuisine culture of Hanoi.
In Hanoi, there are hundreds of street stalls in small kiosks on the sidewalk, with plastic tables and chairs on the pavement. Grabbing a bite at these eateries is a great way to experience the local food and culture. It is worth mentioning that food quality, freshness, and hygiene can vary greatly. A bowl of noodle soup goes for as little as 30,000 dong (Jan 2011, under 1 USD). Market food stalls also offer an assortment of other snacks: fruit portions, sausages, donuts, and other eats for 10,000 to 20,000 dong (Jan 2011, 0.5-1 USD). Be sure to get your change as a few vendors seem to 'forget' to return it to you, and learn a little Vietnamese because vendors often will not speak any or much English. Want to experience Hanoi street food, so the tours <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://hanoifoodtour.com">here</a>
The rule of thumb is if the price is expensive, hygiene quality may or may not be OK, but if the price is cheap, definitely hygiene quality is compromised. There seemed to be no regular food Health Department inspector working regularly in the city.
Another rule of thumb is that Vietnamese have no qualms charging double or more for tourists, as prices are seldom listed on stalls or within shops. Either learn to speak Vietnamese or prepare to pay up to 50,000 dong for that bowl of <i>pho</i> which locals next to you are paying 25,000 dong (as of Dec 2012).
For groceries, there is a large supermarket east of Hoan Kiem Lake (Finimart, 27A Ly Thai To, at Tran Nguyen Han).
Next to Beijing, Hanoi is probably the second in the running to the world's exotic food paradise.
The suburb of Le Mat (aka the Snake Village) has numerous restaurants specializing in <b>cobra foodstuffs.</b> Live cobras are stored on the premises much the same way one would find live lobsters at a Western seafood restaurant. If one orders cobra blood wine from the menu, the waiter will take a live cobra, kill it on the spot, drain the blood into a shot glass of rice wine, and top it off with the cobra's still beating heart for you to gulp down! Not for the faint hearted (excuse the pun). Le Mat is about ten minutes across the river from downtown, take bus 10, 15 or 17 and get off at the large "mega-mall" just beyond Gia Lam station, and walk 500 metres down the road at the right of the mall. Cobras are not cheap at around 400,000-1,000,000 dong (USD$50-) but it gets turned into a dozen unique dishes, enough to share between three or four people.
A local delicacy in the Hanoi area is <b>dog meat</b> (<i>thá»t chÃ³</i>), which is especially popular in the winter. There are a number of restaurants in the Tay Ho district. Another exotic regional taste is <i>ca cuong</i>, an extract from the <i>belostomatid</i>, or <b>giant water bug</b>. Just a few drops are added to noodles for the unique aroma.
Be sure to check out the boiled duck fetus eggs (same as the filipino balut) sold by peddlers almost everywhere priced at 5,000 dong. This delightful experience consists of the vendor cracking the egg in front of you, and peeling the shell and dropping the contents in a plastic micro bowl, then garnished with juliened ginger, basil leaf, and sprinkled with chili sauce. You can see the severed head and beak of your chick that fell off if you are lucky enough to have your first bite from a different spot - Bon Appetit!
Look to the Old Quarter for atmospheric street stalls and reasonably priced Western and local fare.
If you have been travelling in SE Asia for a long time, Hanoi offers excellent bread. The street baguettes are a welcome treat for western taste buds
<a href="/en/Vietnam#Beer" title="Vietnam">Bia HÆ¡i</a> is abundant in the streets of the Old Quarter. At the crossing of <i>Ta Hien</i> and <i>Luong Ngoc Quyen</i> five separate venues fill up with travellers in the evenings, but you can get more local atmosphere on some of the side streets.
Hanoi is a lively city on the weekends, but the Old Quarter closes relatively early (at midnight) on weekdays, so you might want to start your night early. Other places outside the Old Quarter stay open later and vary in closing times.
Local young people gather around the cathedral located in Ly Quoc Su to have lemon ice tea (Tra Chanh) and sunflower seeds in street bars. After dark it gets quite crowded. Tra Chanh: 8,000 to 10,000 dong.
Sit on a plastic chair in front of one of the Bia Hoi (fresh beer) establishments which are invariably situated on the corners of many of Hanoi's 'Old Quarter' streets. This preservative-free light beer is the perfect drink to sip as you watch the city's frenetic life bustle by. The beer costs less than twenty cents and gives you an excuse to relax and take photos of the passing local characters. Should not be missed. Moreover, once you reach the Old Quarter, you will find that almost every corner is filled with stalls selling Pho (Vietnamese noodle) and cafe (the name is not limited only to coffee, but also tea, sweets and grocery items, and yes, even to Pho!).
On <i>T&#244; Tich</i>, a small street connecting <i>Hang Quat</i> and <i>Hang Gai</i>, you can help yourself to a refreshing fruit milkshake (<i>sinh tá»</i>) at one of the stalls (~7000 dong).
Track Bar right under the Long Bien Bridge is no longer open. A lot of locals usually suggest  it but keep in mind that it closed 9 Sep 2012.
Cheeky Quarter is a bar run by a friendly English-Vietnamese couple. It is found at 1 Ta Hien , HoÃ n Kiáº¿m, Hanoi. Just a few shops from Mao's red lounge
Phuc Tan is the place to go once all other bars in the old quarter have shut down.
There are many breweries in Hanoi that serve czech or german styled beer. Mainly they have a black and a blond beer with more malt and hops than the light bia hoi, the full list can be seen at "<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.beervn.com">http://www.beervn.com</a>". You can also book beer tours here. Some of the bigger breweries are Hoa Vien and Goldmalt. There is no ale in Vietnam, to visit one of the local breweries is the closest you can get an ale.

<b>Hanoi hotel scams</b><br />
Be aware information about a hotel from a tout may in fact be different from what the hotel offers, their policy, etc. If ever in doubt, speak with a direct staff member of the hotel.
It may be wise to verify the conditions of "free" products the hotel may offer or even go as far to take pictures of the room or mini bar should proof ever be needed. If ever unsure whether something is complimentary or not, check before partaking of the product or service.
If during your stay a hotel finds a reason to move you to a different hotel, insist they provide proof their claims are legitimate and if they are asking you move to a higher-priced hotel, make sure they have an agreement with the new hotel to pay the difference in price or other arrangements which all parties find suitable.
If at any point during your stay you decide to keep your valuables in a safe box with the hotel administration avoid giving them your credit cards. The hotel owners have been known to use the credit card information to book rooms at their hotels with your cards after your departure.

The Old Quarter is littered with guesthouses and hostels catering for budget travellers. A venue down an alley will not have the constant traffic noise, but check for construction work happening next door, it can wake you up just as early. If you leave food in your room keep it covered/sealed, poor hygiene in the neighbourhood can bring rodents through the smallest of holes in search of sustenance.
Hanoi is a dangerous city, both by Asian and Western standards. Pickpockets are well organized and operate in groups, scams are around every corner, very aggressive hawkers grab tourists by the arm and won't let go unless they buy something, hotel staff members try to pick padlocks on travelers bags, thieves on motorbikes snatch bags from cafe tables, fake mechanics throw nails at tourists on motorbikes to cause flat tires and the police, probably the worst crooks of them all, are known to steal from people (both locals and tourists) and ask for a bribe to get the items back. There is also a dual price policy: tourists usually pay ten times more than locals; this price can increase even more if, in restaurants, you start eating before asking for the price of the meal.
Be vigilant when taking a taxi - driver jumps out at destination and dumps most of your bags out of the trunk. While you're busy putting rucksack on he has taken off with your other bags. Ask your hotel which taxi companies are reliable - stories abound of meters that run at an adjusted (much faster) rate.
Also keep all eyes on your belongings, especially in crowded area like Dong Xuan night market, or just don't go at all if it's not worth the risk; expect female pickpockets and don't let them surround you.
Watch your feet too. Shoe shiners are known to bend down and start polishing away at your shoes (even scruffy Nikes). Politely decline and step away before they complete their shoe shine service and demand a fee.
If you carry a backpack or rucksack, do NOT carry it on your back especially in crowded areas with high tourist traffic eg Hoan Kiem Lake area. Pick pockets will open your bag behind you and help themselves to your belongings. Carry it in front of you instead.
Also, be careful around the streets of Hilton prison museum, a lady will approach you and insist on introducing herself with her pick-up line "Hello, I'm a student." (Who cares?)
Be careful of hustler hawkers. Anywhere else in Vietnam, they have a two-tier pricing system - for locals and for foreigners. No other place in Vietnam is this experienced more emphatically than in Hanoi (and also in Ho Chi Minh Ben Tanh Market) where vendors charge you differently according to how you make an impression. Hawkers may charge 3x more their going rate for an item even if your appearance is similar to them simply because you are not a Viet Kiew, you don't speak the language, and you are sporting an expensive-looking wristwatch. They think you deserve this treatment even if you are eating the humblest food.
Always ask the price first, and give the hawkers exact change if possible. Mobile hawkers (carrying food hung on poles across their shoulders) have been known to pocket the (significant) change and stuff more food than you had intended to buy into your hands, and than quickly take off, leaving the bewildered tourist by the road with his hands full of food he cannot finish.
Like everywhere else in Vietnam, traffic in Hanoi is dominated by an incredible number of motorbikes, all of which seem to be making a mad, desperate dash for something just out of reach â all of the time. All the while blowing their horns incessantly. In other words, pedestrian traffic can be overwhelming for visitors, especially in the narrow streets around the Old Quarter. When you leave the curb, look not only both ways but left, right, back and front, and take each step slowly and patiently allowing them to pass because even an eye contact is not enough with the oncoming drivers and actually before you know it, someone is also on your back since there is no such thing as one-directional traffic in Vietnam. The key word here is <b>slowly</b> â don't rush. This way the drivers are aware of you, and can take you into account (along with all of the other motorbikes). It may look, and indeed is somewhat chaotic, but be patient and pay attention when you're crossing any street, large or small, and you should be fine. Definitely, the streets of Hanoi has no place for faint hearted people, with hypertension and heart problems on top of the disabled and the old.
You should look everywhere as you proceed. Holding out your arm toward the stream of vehicles as a "slow down, I am crossing" sign may be a good idea but not acknowledged most of the time. Don't stop suddenly when you see one coming a little fast or rush your steps when you are crossing. Just even your pace and walk slowly. The motorbikes will find their way to avoid you themselves.
As in any Southeast Asian city, Hanoi is hygienically challenged especially where locals congregate more to dine. Expect that there may be a non-existing Health Department, or this is not in the priority of the city government.
[Note added in October 2013: the above warnings may be unduly alarmist. The center of Hanoi is remarkably tasteful and laid-back, and violent crime is unthinkable. Pickpockets may be there, but some statistics would have been better than fearmongering. Tourist-oriented hassle does exist, but is negligible compared to <a href="/en/Yogyakarta" title="Yogyakarta">Yogyakarta</a>, or even some areas of <a href="/en/Bangkok" title="Bangkok">Bangkok</a> (not to mention places like <a href="/en/India" title="India">India</a> or <a href="/en/Egypt" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>). Overall, be careful, but by no means let yourself be drawn away from this wonderfully stylish city.]
3G internet is very cheap and readily available everywhere in Hanoi. Buying a SIM card costs between 45 000 and 55 000 dong. Unlimited internet for a month costs 40 000 Dong on Viettel (as of June 2013, rates for unlimited 3G on Viettel and the other major telco have just been raised to 50 000).
Do not buy a SIM card at the Vinaphone counter at the Hanoi airport. The lady at the counter will tell you that unlimited internet for a month costs 500 000 dong, SIM card included. She will give you a SIM card, wont set it up correctly, give you no credit and pocket the 500 000 dong. Also, be aware that she writes fake invoices.
There are plenty of internet cafÃ©s all over the city. Most are used by Vietnamese teens playing online dance or battle games. Rates vary, but can be as low as 3,000 dong/hr. Some of the better cafÃ©s, particularly in the Old Quarter, have computers that are Skype-capable for international phone calls. Close to Hanoi Youth Hostel there is a cybercafe that charge tourist ten times the actual cost. It is next door, and has no name. If you are not in a hurry use another one.
The cafes that charge you for using the Internet usually provide desktop computers. There are also cafes where they have free wireless. All you have to do is order something from their menus and use their wifi for as long as you want. The wifi cafes are usually concentrated around Hoan Kiem lake area.
Beware a pair of women near the Hanoi Towers/lake area who claim to be part of the "Red Cross".  They will try to sell you toothpicks for blind and disabled people, and this is most likely a scam. Be very careful when trying to cross the street!
If you are the adventurous type or simply bored temporarily of the city atmosphere, then consider a cruise in the northern countryside. A round trip will bring you to a lot of charming villages and through hills and valleys with stunning nature. Main roads are generally in good condition and you can easily do a couple of hundred kilometers a day. The villages and provinces are generally safe at night, and you get to see a lot of Vietnamese culture such as various tribe folks. While bus services are in fact available (albeit not always reliable), a recommended alternative is to rent a bike or car and make the trip on your own. Motorbikes in decent quality can be rented for as little as US$5 a day, and many places have suggestions for routes.
