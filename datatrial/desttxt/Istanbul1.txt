<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://english.istanbul.com/"><b>Istanbul</b></a> (<a href="/en/Turkish_phrasebook" title="Turkish phrasebook">Turkish</a>: <i>Ä°stanbul</i>) is <a href="/en/Turkey" title="Turkey">Turkey</a>'s most populous city as well as cultural and financial center. Located on both sides of the <b><a href="/en/Istanbul/Bosphorus" title="Istanbul/Bosphorus">Bosphorus</a></b>, the narrow strait between the Black Sea and the Marmara Sea, Istanbul bridges <a href="/en/Asia" title="Asia">Asia</a> and <a href="/en/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a> both physically and culturally. Istanbul's population is estimated to be between 12 and 19 million people, making it also one of the largest in Europe and the world.
Expanding the ancient Greek colony of <b>Byzantium</b> by the order of the Roman Emperor Constantine the Great, the imperial city of <b>Constantinople</b> was for nearly a thousand years the last remaining outpost of the Roman (later termed Eastern Roman or Byzantine) Empire. It was finally conquered by the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II on  29 May 1453, an event sometimes used to mark the end of the Middle Ages. It was the nerve center for military campaigns that were to enlarge the Ottoman Empire dramatically. By the mid 1500s, Istanbul, with a population of almost half a million, was a major cultural, political, and commercial centre. Ottoman rule continued until it was defeated in WWI and Istanbul was occupied by the allies. When the Republic of Turkey was born in 1923 after the War of Independence, Kemal AtatÃ¼rk moved its capital to the city of Ankara. However, Istanbul has continued to expand dramatically; today its population is approximately 14 million and increases at an estimated 400,000 immigrants per year. Industry has expanded even as tourism has grown.
Istanbul is divided in three by the north-south <b>Bosphorus Strait</b> (Istanbul Bogazi), the dividing line between Europe and Asia, the estuary of the <b>Golden Horn</b> (<i>HaliÃ§</i>) bisecting the western part and the <b>Sea of Marmara</b> (<i>Marmara Denizi</i>) forming a boundary to the south.  Most sights are concentrated in the old city on the peninsula of <b>Sultanahmet</b>, to the west of the Bosphorus between the Horn and the Sea.  Across the Horn to the north are <b>Galata</b>, <b>BeyoÄlu</b> and <b>Taksim</b>, the heart of modern Istanbul, while <b>KadÄ±kÃ¶y</b> is the major district on the comparatively less-visited Anatolian side of the city.  The Black Sea forms the northern boundary of Istanbul.
Istanbul has a temperate oceanic climate which is influenced by a continental climate, with hot and humid summers and cold, wet and occasionally snowy winters.
Istanbul has a high annual average rainfall of 844 mm (which is more than that of London, Dublin or Brussels, whose negative reputation Istanbul does not suffer), with late autumn and winter being the wettest, and late spring and summer being the driest. Although late spring and summer are relatively dry when compared to the other seasons, rainfall is significant during these seasons, and there is no dry season as a result.
If there is a negative reputation that Istanbul does suffer from, it is the high annual relative humidity, especially during winter and summer with the accompanying wind chill and concrete-island effect during each respective season.
Summer is generally hot with averages around 27ÂºC during the day and 18ÂºC at night. High relative humidity levels and the âconcrete-island effectâ only make things worse. Expect temperatures of up to 35Â° C for the hottest days of the year. Summer is also the driest season, but it does infrequently rain. Showers tend to last for 15-30 minutes with the sun usually reappearing again on the same day. Flash floods are a common occurrence after heavy rainfalls (especially during summer), due to the city's hilly topography and inadequate sewage systems.
Winter is cold and wet, averaging 2ÂºC at night and 7ÂºC during the day.  Although rarely below freezing during the day, high relative humidity levels and the wind chill makes it feel bitterly cold and very unpleasant.
Snowfall, which occurs almost annually, is common between the months of December and March, with an annual total snow cover of almost three weeks, but average winter snowfall varies considerably from year to year, and snow cover usually remains only for a few days after each snowfall, even under intense snow conditions.
Late spring (late May to early June) and early autumn (late September to early October) are very pleasant and therefore the best times to visit the city.  During these periods it is neither cold nor hot, and still sunny, though the nights can be chilly and rain is common.
For visitors an umbrella is recommended during spring, autumn and winter, and during the summer to avoid the sun and occasionally the rain. However, itâs not such a big problem, since streets of Istanbul are suddenly filled by umbrella sellers as soon as it starts raining. Although the umbrellas they provide are a little shoddy, going rate is only TL 5 âabout US$ 3- per umbrella (though you can find much better umbrellas for that price at shops if you look around a bit).
Light clothing is recommended during summer and a light jacket and/or light sweater if the summer evenings do become chilly, warm clothing is essential during winter and a mixture of the two during spring and autumn.
Also take note that due to its huge size, topography and maritime influences, Istanbul exhibits a multitude of distinct microclimates.  Thus, different sections of Istanbul can experience different weather conditions at the same time.  For example, at the same moment, it can be heavily raining in SarÄ±yer in the north, mildly raining in Levent (northern terminus of metro line), while Taksim, the southern terminus of metro line, is having a perfectly sunny day.
Most planes arrive at <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.ataturkairport.com/">Istanbul AtatÃ¼rk Airport</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IATA" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:IATA">IATA</a>: <b>IST</b>), 20 km west of the city centre. From the airport, there are various options for getting into Istanbul: you can take a <b>taxi</b> (about 35-40 TL to <a href="/en/Istanbul/Galata" title="Istanbul/Galata">Taksim</a>. There is no night fare in Istanbul anymore - the price would be the same at midnight or midday. About the same to <a href="/en/Istanbul/Sultanahmet-Old_City" title="Istanbul/Sultanahmet-Old City">Sultanahmet</a>), the <b>express bus service</b> run by the local airport service called "HavataÅ" <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://havatas.com.tr/">[1]</a> which departs half-hourly between 4AM-midnight and costs 10 TL to Taksim and Aksaray, the public bus (line #96T) run by <i>Ä°ETT</i> costing 5 TL(3.5 with Ä°stanbulKart), which has fewer departure times now, due to Havatas, which is also a municipality engaged bus service.
<br />
Then, there is the <b>metro</b> (06:00 - 00:05) (signposted "light rail" in the airport, when you get outside the baggage claim its about a 10 minute walk in the airport to the metro line. Just follow the signs), which will take you directly to the <i>Otogar</i> (bus station) or to numerous stops within Istanbul (Aksaray in the city centre is the last stop, transfer stations for <b>tram</b> heading for deeper into <a href="/en/Istanbul/Sultanahmet-Old_City" title="Istanbul/Sultanahmet-Old City">old city</a> is available at <a href="/en/Istanbul/Western_Suburbs" title="Istanbul/Western Suburbs">Zeytinburnu</a> and Aksaray). It costs 3 TL, by token (+an extra 3 TL when boarding the tram) and getting to Aksaray takes around 45 minutes. It is possible to be at your bus departing from <i>Otogar</i> within less than one hour after landing by taking the metro.
When entering the metro station, you need to buy a <i>jeton</i> (token) for 3 lira. Just hand the cashier 3 lira and he'll give you a token, or use the automatic dispenser (<i>Jetonmatik</i>), which accepts banknotes (5 TL, 10 TL) as well as coins. Use 'select' to choose the number of jetons and then push 'ok'. They don't accept credit card or foreign currency here. This will get you on the red metro line (towards Aksaray). From this line, if you are going to <a href="/en/Istanbul/Sultanahmet-Old_City" title="Istanbul/Sultanahmet-Old City">Sultanahmet</a>, you can transfer at <a href="/en/Istanbul/Western_Suburbs" title="Istanbul/Western Suburbs">Zeytinburnu</a> and buy another <i>jeton</i> (3 lira) - see the section on "Istanbulkart" if further travel within Istanbul's metro system will be undertaken. Note that the <i>jeton</i> token here is different than the first one. From Zeytinburnu, take the blue tram line T1, towards <a href="/en/Istanbul/Galata" title="Istanbul/Galata">KabataÅ</a> which passes by: Sultanahmet, EminÃ¶nu and Tophane. The trip from the airport to Sultanahmet takes about 45 min.
<b>Other Notes</b>:
Note that people are working on commission at the airport trying to make you use special shuttle buses for very high fees (30+ TL), so for people who wish to travel more economically the Metro/tram-combination is easy and fairly quick, and offers very good value. Travel by metro/tram cost 1 token per trip which is equal to 3 TL. No matter how long you travel, it cost 1 token per trip.
<b>Visa</b>:
Depending on nationality, foreigners arriving in Istanbul may need to purchase tourist visas (USA and some EU citizens, depending on exact nationality, do). This must be done upon arrival before queuing for passport control. The windows for purchasing the visa are located immediately to the left of the main passport control booths. On payment the visa will be  to a page of your passport. You must pay in cash - US dollars, Euros, or British pounds. Turkish lira is NOT taken, but there is an ATM where you can withdraw your own currency should you not have any (this ATM is frequently out of Euro and US $).  You can pay by Mastercard/Visa at the visa desk as of May 2012.  The fee varies depending on the visitorâs nationality.  The fee is $20 for visitors traveling with U.S. and $60 for Australian passports (May 2012). Canadians pay US$60 (or â¬45). EU pays â¬15 (note that GB citizens may pay cash in Pounds (Â£10) but if you use a debit or credit card it will be charged 15 Euro.)
As of May 2013 the Turkish government has launched the e-Visa system in which you can apply and pay for your visa online and print it out at home prior to your trip to avoid waiting in line at the visa desk at the airport.[
<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.evisa.gov.tr/en/info/">https://www.evisa.gov.tr/en/info/</a>]
Note that <b>food and drinks</b> at the airport may cost up to five times more than in the city proper, like in other international airports. If you are traveling on budget and plan to spend some time at the airport, it may be wise to bring your own meals from town instead of buying them there. If you come from the Metro, there is a supermarket in the tunnel leading to the elevators / stairs to the airport proper where you can do some last-minute shopping.
Istanbul also has a second airport, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.sgairport.com/"><b>Sabiha GÃ¶kÃ§en International Airport</b></a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IATA" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:IATA">IATA</a>: <b>SAW</b>), located in the <a href="/en/Istanbul/Asian_Side" title="Istanbul/Asian Side">Anatolian side</a> of the city.
The cheapest way to arrive from Sabiha GÃ¶kÃ§en in the European side of Istanbul is by bus (E10 line, from Sabiha GÃ¶kÃ§en to KadikÃ¶y) + ferry(from KadikÃ¶y to many ferry stations, including some in the Sultanahmet area). It costs no more than 7TL for the bus ride and then you pay only 2TL for the ferry ride (which is linked to the public transport system, meaning you can also use akbil or electronic transport  prepaid cards to pay for the ferry). That's less than â¬4 in total. Every other option priced at â¬10 and above ( 23 lira and above-by Feb 2013 rates) makes sense ONLY if you can't use this. And BEWARE of the company running the "HOTEL INFORMATION" office in the Sabiha GÃ¶kÃ§en airport, see below.
A <b><i>Havatas</i> bus</b> connects this airport with Taksim in the city centre for 13 TL (July 2013) and takes about an hour (closer to two or more in heavy traffic). There is also a Havatas service to KadÄ±kÃ¶y, a transportation hub of Asian Side, which costs 8 TL. If you arrive in the middle of the night, you can move to the departure hall after passing customs and rest on very comfortable seats â you will even find coin-operated Japanese massage chairs. Then, at 05:00 the first Havatas bus will take you to town. The Havatas bus schedule is sometimes linked to the arrival/departure times of planes.
A cheaper option is to take <b>public bus</b> line #E9 to Kaynarca (<i>get off at Tersane Lojmanlari</i>) in (30 min, 2 TL); see timetables <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.iett.gov.tr/saat/orer.php?hid=Saatler&amp;hatcode=E-9">[2]</a>). From Kaynarca, you can take a suburban train (BanliyÃ¶ Treni) to Haydarpasa (50 min, 2 TL), from where you can take a ferry to <a href="/en/Istanbul/Galata" title="Istanbul/Galata">KarakÃ¶y</a> (2 TL). Total travel time is approx. 1 h 40 min and the cost 6 TL.
Various private operators offer internet bookable shared minibuses to central locations â a good choice when arriving late. A typical price being EUR 90 for 4 people to a hotel in <a href="/en/Istanbul/Sultanahmet-Old_City" title="Istanbul/Sultanahmet-Old City">Laleli</a>.  A taxi to Sabiha GÃ¶kÃ§en airport from Taksim, which lies around 50 km from the airport, takes ~35 minutes at 3:30am with no traffic.  The meter will show ~75 lira, plus there is ~6 lira in tolls.  Note the security screening is <i>before</i> the check-in counters, so add some extra time to make the cutoff times (45 minutes for international, 30 for domestic).
Beware of the company running the "Hotel Information" office in the  Sabiha GÃ¶kÃ§en airport which offers "shuttle-to-hotel" services from â¬15 (they pretend to make a discount based on your group size, you can get it as low as â¬12.5 for 4 people)  because their drivers are totally uninformed about any hotel address and they may get lost/the trip may take 2-3 times more than normal because of their lack of knowledge with hotel addresses.
When arriving at Sabiha GÃ¶kÃ§en airport, there are people offering shuttle services to the European side of the city, most costing â¬10, which is much cheaper than booking a taxi with your hotel/hostel (about â¬50-60). It is the best option after the Havatas airport buses. For the return journey, officers are quite zealous with luggage checks and they systematically remove the cap from bottled water once at the gate. It is recommended not to buy water before the flight although you can take the open bottle on board. Another surprising feature of Sabiha GÃ¶kÃ§en airport is the luggage check at the main entrance, but fortunately you are allowed to take drinks in the airport at this point.
<b>NOTE:</b> Due to construction of the Bosporus Rail Tunnel and new high-speed lines between Istanbul and Ankara <b>all long-distance train services are suspended until 2015</b>. Trains from Europe terminate at the border where designated buses are avalible for the rest of the journey. On the Asian side, trains from south (<a href="/en/Konya" title="Konya">Konya</a> and <a href="/en/Adana" title="Adana">Adana</a> amongst others) will have their terminus in <a href="/en/Eski%C5%9Fehir" title="EskiÅehir">EskiÅehir</a>. Trains from <a href="/en/Eastern_Anatolia" title="Eastern Anatolia">eastern Turkey</a> and <a href="/en/Iran" title="Iran">Iran</a> terminates in <a href="/en/Ankara" title="Ankara">Ankara</a>. The sole exception of this are the trains from Gebze, a suburb 45 km east of Istanbul.
<br />
International trains from across Europe arrive at the station in Sirkeci, close to Sultanahmet. Asian trains arrive at Haydarpasa station. To get between the two, catch a ferry across the Bosphorus (see Get around). Marmaray, the Rail Tube Tunnel and Commuter Rail Mass Transit System is being built, and is projected to be one of the most challenging infrastructure projects in Turkey.
<b>International trains to Sirkeci</b>
Trains from <a href="/en/Budapest" title="Budapest">Budapest</a> and <a href="/en/Thessaloniki" title="Thessaloniki">Thessaloniki</a> are cancelled since 2011.
<b>International trains to Haydarpasa</b>
Schedule and price list of railway trips can be gathered from TCDD (Turkish Republic State Railways) <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://tcdd.gov.tr/">[3]</a>.
When arriving at the Turkish border from Europe, you may need to buy a visa before getting your passport stamp. This counter accepts only Euros or USD, not Turkish Lira. You need to go to the visa counter first to purchase your visa, then to passport control to get it stamped.
Most buses and coaches terminate at the colossal Esenler <i>Otogar</i>, about 10 km west of the city center, located on the European side. The station can be easily reached via the Otogar stop on the M1. Companies may also have courtesy minibuses or taxis which will allow you to easily access the center of the city.
Buses depart/arrive for all regions of Turkey as well as for international destinations including  cities in <a href="/en/Bulgaria" title="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a>, <a href="/en/Greece" title="Greece">Greece</a>, <a href="/en/Republic_of_Macedonia" title="Republic of Macedonia">Republic of Macedonia</a> and <a href="/en/Romania" title="Romania">Romania</a>. The terminal is huge and each company has a separate office. The area can be a tourist trap with people wanting to help get you to the right office -- for a fee. It is easiest if you know who you want to travel with when you arrive.
With 168 ticket offices and gates, shops, restaurants, hotel, police station, clinic and mosque, the BÃ¼yÃ¼k Otogar is a town in itself.
From/To Thessaloniki (Greece): ticket prices are around â¬45 (one way),â¬80 with return . From/To Sofia and Varna (Bulgaria): ~30â¬ (one way). From/To Skopje (Macedonia): ~40â¬ (one way). Ticket prices may change related with petrol costs but on an avarage 100 kilometers costs 5â¬ (Euros). Some bus companies selling online tickets from their individual webpages. Varan, Ulusoy, Metro and KamilKoÃ§ are considered as best bus companies of Turkey.
"Harem" is the major hub for the buses on the Anatolian (Asian) side, which can be reached easily from the European side with a Ferryboat.
Turkish bus companies mostly donât have a toilet inside the bus. Buses stop for rest and needs usually every 4 or 5 hours. Rest duration is 30 minutes.
International ferries, carrying tourist groups from outside Turkey stop at Karakoy Port. The port is ideally located close to Sultanahmet and Taksim.
Cruise ships often dock close to downtown.  Passengers not on tours will find taxis readily available at the port entrance, and modern streetcars a short walk away.
Traffic in Istanbul can be manic; expect a stressful drive because you will be cut off and honked at constantly. The city currently holds more than 1,500,000 automobiles and there is a strong demand for building of new or alternate highways.
If you've arrived in Istanbul by car, and you're not familiar with the streets, it's better to park your car in a safe place and take public transportation to get around.
The city, lying on two different continents and separated by the Bosphorus, is connected by two bridges. The bridge on the south, closer to the Marmara Sea, is called the "Bosphorus Bridge". The bridge closer to the Black Sea is named "Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge" and is longer than the first one. Both are toll bridges, and you must pay a fee to cross.
Since 2006, the Bosphorus Bridge toll stations do not accept cash, and payment must be made using electronic cards, either manually (KGS) or automatically via a transponder mounted on the front of the car (OGS).  The Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge does not accept cash either, only KGS or OGS. The minimum amount of credit which can be purchased for a KGS card is 50 Turkish Lyra (October 2012).
On weekdays, drivers should be aware of potentially hour-long traffic jams on the highways leading to both bridges, particularly heading west in the mornings and east in the evenings, since most people live on the Anatolian side but work on the European side.
There is a great shortage of parking in Istanbul, and existing lots are quite expensive. You will see many cars parked on the sides of the road, in front of garage doors even.
Drivers unfamiliar with the city should also be aware that street signs are rare. It is a common thing to pull over and ask for directions, something the natives and taxi drivers do quite often.
Istanbul's public transit system can be difficult to figure out; maps are rare and you often have to transfer, and pay another fare, to get where you are going. However, if you put some effort into it, you can avoid taxis and not walk too much.
Each time you use a tram, metro, bus, or boat on the public transport system, you will need to use a token. The small metal/plastic tokens cost 3 TL (September 2012) and can be bought at various ticket kiosks &amp; machines at bus, railway and metro stations. Ticket fares across buses, trams and metros are at a flat rate (i.e. not dependent on how far you go). Only cash in Turkish lira is accepted at ticket kiosks of public transport, no credit cards or foreign currency.  Also be aware that the Istanbul subway system does not offer transfer tickets and as such each new line requires a new fare, unless you use an an Istanbulkart or Akbil, see below.
Buying an Istanbulkart is a good idea if you are in Istanbul for more than a day or two, and intend to use public transport. This is a plastic card that looks like a credit card.  It can be used as a ticket on buses, trams, suburban trains, metro and even the cross-Bosphorus ferries. You touch the Istanbulkart to a reader when you get on the bus or enter the tram/metro platform. The great part for groups of travellers is that you can buy only one and touch it as many times as there are passengers (unlike London's <i>Oyster</i> card, there is no need to <i>touch out</i>). You can buy or refill them at designated booths located at any major bus, tram, to metro station, as well as some other places such as newspaper stands close to bus stops. An Istanbulkart provides a flat fare of 1.95TL for the first ride, which is a cheaper option in comparison to tokens used in Metro and speed trams (jeton, 3TL), but more expensive for buses. It is also 3,50TL to the Prince's Islands, instead of 5TL for a token. Istanbulkart also allows discounts in transfers (when used multiple times within a limited period, roughly an hour and a half since the last time you used it). A deposit for the device itself is payable when you buy it (10 TL - or 7TL? - confusion reigns!), which is not refundable, and neither is any credit left on the Istanbulkart (when bought at the Ataturk airport metro terminus, 4TL deposit will be already on the card when bought). Note that there are different booths for buying the card and for charging it, and charging booths accept only 5, 10, and 20 lira banknotes.
Once you have bought and loaded the card, your first journey costs 1.95TL (except for Metrobus, which costs around 3TL), then any change within approximately 2 hours costs progressively cheaper; second journey is 1.25TL, third is 1.00TL and so on. Note that changing metro line or travel type, i.e. ferry to bus, or metro to tram, requires you to go out of the turnstiles then to check back in to the new line or travel type. Therefore this is extremely more economic than buying individual <i>jetons</i> at 3TL per journey.
The Istanbulkard is relatively new, and is replacing the older <i>Akbil</i> metal touch-token which is being phased out (but is still in wide use).  It is now just about impossible to buy an Akbil.  However, there are still some places that do not yet accept the Istanbulkart, so if you have an Akbil token left over from previous trips to Istanbul, keep hold of it:  they still work.  Some Kiosks still have <i>Akbil</i> signs rather than <i>Istanbulkart</i> signs - but you can usually buy or top up your Istanbulkart at any kiosk where the <i>Akbil</i> sign is displayed.
Buses and streetcars tend to be very crowded during rush hours, especially on Mondays and Fridays. That can also create opportunities for pickpockets.
What Is ISTANBUL KART
<br />
The New Ä°stanbul Kart is a RFID (Radio-frequency identification) card which fits perfectly in a wallet since it has the dimensions of a regular credit card. It is a pre-paid and rechargeable card, which can be used to cover fares and entrance fees. It will enable passengers to cover any kind of transportation fees, including bus, tram, metro, funicular, ferry and sea-bus fares.
The Electronic Fare Collection System is an information management system that is secure, fast and accurate. It provides pre-paid rides in the mass transportation system.
Smart cards are widely used for their ease of use and high security. istanbulkart is the contactless smart card introduced by the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality for urban services and electronic ticket applications. It is up to the international standards for contactless smart cards (ISO 7816 and ISO 14443).
Work is underway to utilize "istanbulkart" as a loyalty card and a membership card in civic services, event ticketing, car parking, social aid identification and access control, e-health, electronic passport, electronic ticket, e-campus, etc.
The first step of the project was to transfer the conventional electronic fare collection system into the card system in addition to AKBÄ°L.

Istanbulkart is the transit pass card of Istanbul public transportation 
A plastic RFID chip card that you load money onto then use for transit fares. It's the most convenient way to travel on public transit in Istanbul (<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.istanbul-kart.com/Veriler.asp?Veri_id=Bilgi_3">http://www.istanbul-kart.com/Veriler.asp?Veri_id=Bilgi_3</a>)

There are two types of public buses in Istanbul; those run by the private sector and those run by the city-owned <i>Ä°ETT</i>. You can differentiate these two types by their colors. Privately run buses are blue-green with yellow non-electronic destination signs while <i>Ä°ETT</i>-run buses come in many flavors including old red-blue ones, newer green ones and red double-deckers. The <i>Akbil</i> Transit Pass is valid universally while tickets that can be obtained in kiosks near bus stops for 1.40 TL are valid only on <i>Ä°ETT</i> buses and cash payment only on private buses, although if you get on an <i>Ä°ETT</i> bus the driver will normally accept cash (normally 1.50 TL but this is dependent entirely upon what the driver wishes to charge) and hand you his <i>Akbil</i> for you to use.
Recently installed <i>MetrobÃ¼s</i>, long hybrid buses running on their special lanes separated from all other traffic and thus saving lots of time in Istanbul's usually congested roads, connect <a href="/en/Istanbul/Western_Suburbs" title="Istanbul/Western Suburbs">western suburb</a> of AvcÄ±lar with KadÄ±kÃ¶y in <a href="/en/Istanbul/Asian_Side" title="Istanbul/Asian Side">Asian Side</a> via <a href="/en/Istanbul/Western_Suburbs" title="Istanbul/Western Suburbs">BakÄ±rkÃ¶y</a>, CevizlibaÄ which is just out of <a href="/en/Istanbul/Sultanahmet-Old_City" title="Istanbul/Sultanahmet-Old City">old city</a> walls near TopkapÄ± Gate, and <a href="/en/Istanbul/New_City" title="Istanbul/New City">MecidiyekÃ¶y</a>.
Most bus lines operate between 6AM and around midnight, usually with a reduced volume of services after 10PM. Some lines between major centres operate 24 hr, though, as is the <i>MetrobÃ¼s</i>, with about an hour intervals. After midnight, buses cost two tickets pp rather than the usual one.
<b>24 hr Bus Lines</b>:

<br />
As a tourist, you are most likely to use the tram and the metro in the Sultanahmet and Taksim area since there are no bus lines operating in the area anymore.
Istanbul's first underground system dates back to 19th century, when the funicular subway "TÃ¼nel" was constructed to operate from <a href="/en/Istanbul/Galata" title="Istanbul/Galata">KarakÃ¶y to Istiklal Street</a> in 1875. The distance travelled was 573 metres. Recommended option to go up-hill from Galata Bridge (Beyoglu side) to the famous Istiklal Caddesi (main street).
In 1990's, a modern tram line was constructed in the European side of the city, and now it's being extended to the inner parts of the city, as well as to the Anatolian side with a sea-tunnel named "Marmaray" crossing below the Bosphorus.
Istanbul's metro consists of two lines, the northern line is currently just a short stub connecting ÅiÅhane to HacÄ±osman via <a href="/en/Istanbul/Galata" title="Istanbul/Galata">Taksim Square</a>, and MecidiyekÃ¶y and Levent in <a href="/en/Istanbul/New_City" title="Istanbul/New City">business district</a>. There is also a funicular system connecting Taksim to KabataÅ where you can get on ferries and cross to the <a href="/en/Istanbul/Asian_Side" title="Istanbul/Asian Side">Anatolian side</a>, and also transfer to trams bound for <a href="/en/Istanbul/Sultanahmet-Old_City" title="Istanbul/Sultanahmet-Old City">old city</a>. The separate southern line is most useful for visitors, connecting Aksaray (with its connections to the tram line onwards to old city) to AtatÃ¼rk Airport, via the main coach station (<i>Otogar</i>). A connecting line between southern and northern lines, crossing Golden Horn on a bridge, is under construction, but don't hold your breath.
M4 line started operating in August 2012 on the Asian side and runs between KadikÃ¶y and Kartal with extension further east being under construction as well as tunnel under the Bosborus.
Nowadays, most metro stations do <i>not</i> have a staffed ticket booth, so you will have to obtain your token from automatic token dispensers (called Jetonmatic). Insert coins (except 1 or 5 kuruÅ) up to 3 TL and then press the button marked <i>onay</i> (Turkish for "approval", no English translations are given on all the machines).
A token costs 3 TL (around â¬1.30) on any urban rail in Istanbul.
A tram (line # <b>T1</b>) connects Zeytinburnu (connection to the metro line to the airport) to KabataÅ (connection to the underground funicular to Taksim). The line is 14km long, has 24 stations and serves many popular tourist sites (e.g. in Sultanahmet) and ferries (e.g. EminÃ¶nÃ¼). An entire trip takes 42 minutes.
There are two tram lines running on the same tracks, the line numbered as 38 in front of tram cars runs along the entire T1 line between KabataÅ and Zeytinburnu, while significantly shorter line #47 runs between EminÃ¶nÃ¼ and CevizlibaÄ stations (the latter of which is abbreviated as C.baÄ-A.Ã.Y. on the signage of tram cars). However, both lines call at stations that are of most interest to travellers through the <a href="/en/Istanbul/Sultanahmet-Old_City" title="Istanbul/Sultanahmet-Old City">Old City</a>. During morning and evening rush hours every alternate tram runs as #47, while during the rest of the day, most run as #38.
Although you may use the same tokens (2 TL) or <i>AKBÄ°L</i> on the metro and tram, you must pay another fare each time you change lines.
The tram was put in service in 1992 on standard gauge track with modern cars, connecting Sirkeci with Topkapi. The line was extended on one end from Topkapi to Zeytinburnu in March 1994 and, on the other end from Sirkeci to EminÃ¶nÃ¼ in April 1996. On January 30, 2005 it was extended from Sirkeci to KabataÅ crossing Golden Horn after 44 years again. 55 vehicles built by ABB run on the line. The daily transport capacity is 155,000 passengers.
Tramway stations are: Zeytinburnu, MithatpaÅa, AkÅemsettin, Seyitnizam, Merkezefendi, CevizlibaÄ, TopkapÄ±, Pazartekke, Ãapa, FÄ±ndÄ±kzade, Haseki, YusufpaÅa, Aksaray, Laleli (Ãniversite), BeyazÄ±t (KapalÄ±Ã§arÅÄ±), ÃemberlitaÅ, Sultanahmet, GÃ¼lhane, Sirkeci, EminÃ¶nÃ¼ (ferryboats), KarakÃ¶y, Tophane, FÄ±ndÄ±klÄ±, KabataÅ.
Between Taksim and Kabatas, there is a modern underground funicular to connect this tram line to the Taksim metro. The tram is also connected to the southern metro line (for the <i>Otogar</i> and Ataturk Airport) at Aksaray station, though the metro and tram lines are a short walk from each other.
During morning and evening rush hours (roughly between 7AM-9AM and 5PM-7:30PM respectively), tram cars run jam-packed so if you intend to take it for a couple of stations down the way, don't even botherâwalking instead is not only less tiresome than standing in what is essentially more crowded than a sardine can, it's also quicker as you will most likely be able to get in the second or even third tram calling at the station due to the crowd.
There are also two other tram lines linking residential and industrial suburbs in the northwest with the city centre: <b>T2</b>, which heads for BaÄcÄ±lar, and <b>T4</b> (which is more like <i>metro-tram</i> systems of northwestern Europe, as it lies underground for part of its route), which heads for SultanÃ§iftliÄi, connecting to the Zeytinburnu and TopkapÄ± stations of the T1 line respectively. However, these lines are of very little, if any, use to the average traveller.
The process of replacing old buses with newer ones accessible for people using a wheelchair is ongoing. Many buses on central lines have a low floor and a built-in ramp (consult the driver to lean the bus down nearer to the ground, to open the ramp, and to assist into the bus, though any of these might unfortunately be impossible during peak hours in interval stops. Think of a sardine-packed bus unloading all of its passengers to lean down).
By September 2011 LCD screens showing the stop names while approaching to the stop, and voice announcement is made.
Trams are accessible for people using a wheelchair from the station platforms if you can manage to get into the station in the first place. Some of the stations are located in the middle of very wide avenues and the only access to them is via underground passages (tens of stairs) or overpasses (more stairs!). Otherwise, platforms in tram stations are low and equipped with gentle ramps right from the street (or sidewalk) level.
All stations are announced both on a display and by voice in the trams.
All stations and trains in the northern metro line are accessible for people using a wheelchair. Look around the station entrances for handicapped lifts/elevators. Only some of the stations in the southern metro line are equipped with such elevators (among the stations which have elevators are Aksaray-the main station of the city centre, Otogar-the main bus station, and HavalimanÄ± (Airport) station), but whether there is an elevator or not, if you manage to get into the station (there is a good chance that you can do with a little assistance because the stations in the southern line arenât located as deep as the stations of the northern line are; only about one floorâs height under the ground), all trains are accessible from the station platforms, though a little assistance more will be helpful for passing over the narrow gap between the train and the platform. You can ask the guys in grey/black uniforms (security guards, they can be seen in the entrances of the station platforms if not elsewhere) for assistance, itâs their duty.
All stations are announced by voice in the metro trains. In northern line it is also announced on a display, but not in the southern line. Instead, you should look at the signs in the stations, which are big and common enough.
Unique Istanbul liners (large conventional ferry boats), sea-buses (high speed catamarans), or mid-sized private ferries travel between the European and Asian sides of the city. The crossing takes about 20 minutes and costs 1.50 TL, and gives great views of the Bosphorus. <i>Be aware that sometimes the ferry when arriving at a dock can bounce off the pier accidentally, even on calm days. This can cause people to fall over if they are standing up, so it is advisable to remain seated until the ferry has come to an absolute stop.</i>
In Istanbul, liners from any given quay generally take only a certain route, and these quays are signposted âX Iskelesiâ (âX Landing stage/pierâ). For instance, <a href="/en/Istanbul/Sultanahmet-Old_City" title="Istanbul/Sultanahmet-Old City">EminÃ¶nÃ¼</a> alone has more than 5 landing stages (including the ones used by other ferries apart from liners), so if you should head for, say, <a href="/en/Istanbul/Asian_Side" title="Istanbul/Asian Side">ÃskÃ¼dar</a>, you should take the ferry which departs from âÃskÃ¼dar Iskelesiâ. Replace âÃskÃ¼darâ with the destination of your choice.
<b>Istanbul liners</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://ido.com.tr">[6]</a> travel on the following routes:
Furthermore, the <b>sea-buses</b> (<i>deniz otobÃ¼sÃ¼</i>) follow the same (or more) routes, usually much faster than liners.
Returning to Yenikapi from Kadikoy by <b>sea-bus</b> is a fast and convenient way to cross the Bosphorus; at Yenikapi
there is a railway station with frequent trains to Sirkeci/EminÃ¶nÃ¼ and the Yenikapi fish restaurant area is close by (or one stop on the train).
Four main <b>private ferry</b> routes for travelling between Asia and Europe sides are:
Very useful are the fast ferryboats (travelling at 55 kilometers) running from several points, such as the Yenikapi - <a href="/en/Yalova" title="Yalova">Yalova</a> one, that allows you (with a connecting bus in Yalova) to be in <a href="/en/Bursa" title="Bursa">Bursa</a> centre in less than three hours. Prices are marginally higher and the gain in time is considerable, though the view is not as nice.
All of the ferries, including private ones, can be paid for using the <i>AKBIL</i> system or the new Smart RFID Card that is in the process of introduction.
A new metro line extension crossing the Bosphorus in a tunnel is under construction. This will change the ferry provision and is perhaps a good reason to visit Istanbul before it is completed.
Suburban/commuter trains (<i>banliyÃ¶ treni</i>) using somewhat dilapidated stock and running on national rail network, connect suburbs along the European and <a href="/en/Istanbul/Asian_Side" title="Istanbul/Asian Side">Asian</a> coast of the Sea of Marmara to main stations at Sirkeci and HaydarpaÅa, respectively. These trains are one of the fastest connections between the <a href="/en/Istanbul/Sultanahmet-Old_City" title="Istanbul/Sultanahmet-Old City">old city</a> and <a href="/en/Istanbul/Western_Suburbs" title="Istanbul/Western Suburbs">western suburbs</a>, especially BakÄ±rkÃ¶y, although they, especially the line on European Side, are best avoided late at night.
Taxis are an easy and cheap way to get around. As of December 2011, start off rate is 2.70 TL (â¬1.2) and then 1.7 TL (â¬0.73) for each km afterwards. A one-way travel from Taksim to Sultanahmet costs approximately 10-15 TL. Tipping is generally unnecessary. Occasionally, drivers will refuse to start the meter and try to negotiate a fixed price (but most drivers will start taximeters at all times). You should avoid these cabs and simply take another one as you will almost certainly end paying too much. To be sure, before getting in, just ask "how much to go to ...?" (most of the drivers understand basic English) since the price they tell then is quite accurate. Tell them then to put the taximeter on. Drivers do normally work with the taximeter, so they will not be surprised at all when you ask them to put it on. The price at the end will be quite close to the one they tell you at the beginning. <b>There is now, as of October 2009, just one fare unit, it means, there is no extra fare at night.</b>
Taxis that wait near a bus station are usually a tourist trap. They start the meter but charge you 20 TL at least. Emphasize to the driver that you will pay for the meter price before getting in. Do not buy their quick-sell tricks. Always try to stop a taxi that is passing by on the road or find a legitimate taxi stop.
Insist on going to the destination that you want because some drivers are payed by commission for each time they have someone go to a certain site.
Beware riding a taxi other than the "yellow-colored" ones since the other-colored taxis are registered under different cities and have a different rating system.
Be careful on what notes you hand them for payment; some drivers have tried to pretend that the 50 lira note that was handed was just a 5 lira note. Occasionally taxi drivers may actually also rip notes you give them, and tell you it is no good, in order to make you hand them a 50 lira note. So, make sure the notes are not ripped, and is actually the right one before you hand them over. Also, if you are not familiar with the city the taxi driver may drive a detour in order to charge you more.
Traffic can be very bad, it can take an hour for a few km through the old city. You might be better off taking the metro out of the old city and then a taxi from there.
Some important routes with distances and estimated taxi prices are&#160;:
<b>DolmuÅ</b> (Turkish: "full") is a shared taxi, travelling on a fixed route, which costs more than a city autobus but less than a normal taxi. They can carry up to 8 passengers. They are easy to recognize, because they also have the yellow painting as taxis and carry a <i>Dolmus</i> sign on its top. They will only start driving when all eight places are filled, which is also where the name derives from.
The main and most important routes for Dolmuses are&#160;:
If you want the driver to make a stop, you can say <b>Ä°necek var.</b>(EE-neh-djek war!) (Someone's getting out.) or <b>MÃ¼sait bir yerde.</b>(mU-sa-EEt bir yer-deh.) (At a convenient spot.).
With its long history at the center of empires, Istanbul offers a wealth of historic and religious places to take in. The bulk of these ancient monuments, dating back to Roman, Byzantine, and Ottoman periods, including the <b>Hagia Sophia</b>, <b>TopkapÄ± Palace</b>, <b>Sultanahmet Mosque</b> (Blue Mosque), and <b>Basilica Cistern</b> are located around <a href="/en/Istanbul/Sultanahmet-Old_City" title="Istanbul/Sultanahmet-Old City">Sultanahmet Square</a>, while some others are dispersed throughout the peninsula of <a href="/en/Istanbul/Sultanahmet-Old_City" title="Istanbul/Sultanahmet-Old City">old city</a>, such as <b>Church of St Savior in Chora</b> (<i>Kariye MÃ¼zesi</i>), entire inside of which is covered by mindblowing frescoes and mosaics. An impressive section of mostly intact <b><a href="/en/Istanbul#Theodosian_Walls_Walk" title="Istanbul">Theodosian walls</a></b>, which mark the full length of western boundary of the peninsula, is right next to this particular church.
North of the peninsula of old city, across the Golden Horn, is <a href="/en/Istanbul/Galata" title="Istanbul/Galata">Galata</a>, crowned by the <b>Galata Tower</b>. <b>Istanbul Modern</b>, with its exhibitions of contemporary Turkish art, is on the nearby waterfront of KarakÃ¶y. Another sight of religious significance close by is the <b>Galata Whirling Dervish Hall</b> of Sufi <i>Mevlevi</i> order, just north of the Tower. Further north is the <b>Istiklal Avenue</b>, Istanbul's prominent pedestrian street running from near Galata Tower to Taksim Square, the central square of whole city.
Heading west rather than north from the old city brings you deeper into the banks of the <a href="/en/Istanbul/Golden_Horn" title="Istanbul/Golden Horn">Golden Horn</a> estuary. A neighbourhood perhaps well worth a visit here is EyÃ¼p, to visit cityâs <b>holiest Islamic shrine</b> and just to see what <b>daily life in Ottoman Istanbul</b> was like. On the opposite shores of the Horn, in SÃ¼tlÃ¼ce is the <b>Miniaturk</b>, the first miniature park in the city, with models from around the former Ottoman Empire.
North of Taksim Square is <a href="/en/Istanbul/New_City" title="Istanbul/New City">New Istanbul</a>, main business district of the city. If venturing out to this direction, don't forget to check out <b>Military Museum</b>, where Ottoman military music concerts (<i>Mehter</i>) are held every afternoon. Most of the <b>skyscrapers</b> of the city are located in the north of this district, around Levent and Maslak, with a totally different skyline from that of the old city. However southern reaches of the very same district has some fine <b>neo-classical</b> and <b>Art Nouveau buildings</b> from the turn of the 20th century, around the neighbourhoods of Osmanbey, KurtuluÅ, and NiÅantaÅÄ±. Just east from here, with a little drop in elevation as you approach the shore, is the banks of <a href="/en/Istanbul/Bosphorus" title="Istanbul/Bosphorus">Bosphorus</a>, that is lined by pleasant neighbourhoods full of <b>waterfront mansions</b> (<i>yalÄ±</i>) and a number of waterside <b>palaces</b> where you can admire what money could buy in times gone by.
Across the Bosphorus to east is <a href="/en/Istanbul/Asian_Side" title="Istanbul/Asian Side">Asian Side</a>, centred around the historical districts of KadÄ±kÃ¶y and ÃskÃ¼dar, and perhaps best symbolized by <b>Maidenâs Tower</b>, located at about the halfway between these districts, on an islet just off the shore. Bosphorus and Marmara coasts of this half of the city is characterized by quite <b>picturesque neighbourhoods</b>, overlooked by <b>ÃamlÄ±ca Hill</b>, one of the highest hills of the city which has a view of much of the rest of the city as well, with a cafe and a pleasant park on its summit.
Southeast of the city, off the southern coast of Asian Side are the <a href="/en/Istanbul/Princes%E2%80%99_Islands" title="Istanbul/Princesâ Islands">Princesâ Islands</a>, an archipelago of nine car-free islands, characterized by stunning <b>wooden mansions</b> and <b>pine groves</b>.
Long ignored for their bad connotation with the Tulip era of 1700s, a period of ostentation and costly parties conducted by state elite amidst large gardens full of tulips (and also when the first bulbs were introduced to the <a href="/en/Netherlands" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a> from Istanbul, by the way), which was later accused of economic destruction and the eventual dissolution of Ottoman Empire, <b>tulips</b> have regained much of their former popularity in the last decade and now serve as some sort of symbol of both Istanbul and the whole Turkey. They bloom from late March to early May (best bet is early to mid April) and while they can be seen on many avenues of the city wherever there is enough space for planting at the sides and the central strip of the road, if you are after admiring and/or photographing large patches of tulips with relatively exotic varieties, head to Sultanahmet Park and GÃ¼lhane Park in <a href="/en/Istanbul/Sultanahmet-Old_City" title="Istanbul/Sultanahmet-Old City">Sultanahmet</a>; Emirgan Park near the northern <a href="/en/Istanbul/Bosphorus" title="Istanbul/Bosphorus">Bosphorus</a> neighbourhood of Emirgan; or ÃamlÄ±ca Hill in <a href="/en/Istanbul/Asian_Side" title="Istanbul/Asian Side">Asian Side</a>. There is also a Tulip Festival throughout April organized at Emirgan Park <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.istanbulunlalesi.com">[13]</a>.
See <a href="/en/Hamams_of_Istanbul" title="Hamams of Istanbul">Hamams of Istanbul</a> page for more information on Turkish Bath's in Ä°stanbul.
A visit to a <i>hamam</i> (Turkish bath) is an essential part of any trip to Istanbul and is something you'll be sure to repeat before leaving. There are at least one historical <i>hamam</i> in each neighborhood of Istanbul. Take care in selecting a hamam, as they can vary greatly in cleanliness.  
Most places will offer a scrubbing and/or a massage. Just being in the <i>Hamam</i> (as a sauna), is enough for seeing and experiencing the place, but the scrubbing is a great experience. The massage is not necessarily better than those found in western countries.
<a href="/en/Istanbul/Sultanahmet-Old_City#Hamams" title="Istanbul/Sultanahmet-Old City">Sultanahmet</a> has many historical hamams. Some are very extravagant and cater mainly to tourists.
An example of <i>hamam</i> frequented by locals is the Buyuk Hamam where a full session (massage plus scrub) will cost you 35 TL instead of the 60â¬ of the touristic ones. The experience is true turkish so don't expect any western standards <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://doublewild.com/2012/08/11/two-days-in-istanbul/">[14]</a>.
Once upon a time, the nargile, or Turkish water pipe, was the centre of Istanbulâs social and political life. Today some of the locals still consider it one of lifeâs great pleasures and is something interesting to try. Most of the places where you can smoke a nargile are in
YeniÃ§eriler Caddesi, near the KapalÄ± ÃarÅÄ± (Grand Bazaar). Ãorlulu Ali PaÅa and Koca Sinan PaÅa TÃ¼rbesi are both in secluded internal courts, just around the corner from some tomb yards, while Rumeli Kahvesi is actually inside the cemetery of an old medrese, though itâs not as spooky as you might think. In the south of Sultanahmet, near the sea, is Yeni Marmara (ÃayÄ±roÄlu Sokak), where you can also sit in the terrace and enjoy the view. In BeyoÄlu, at the Ortakahve (BÃ¼yÃ¼kparmakkapÄ±), thereâs even the choice of a wide range of flavors.
Another area with few big good looking places is the RÄ±htÄ±m Caddesi, between Galata bridge and Istanbul Modern Museum.
Museums and such: Haghia Sophia, then on to the TopkapÄ± museum (these two should take at least three to five hours), preferably along the road in the back of the Haghia Sophia, where there are some nicely restored houses. Then on to the Blue Mosque and the square with the obelisks on it (At Meydani). Along its side is the very good Museum of Islam Art. Descend slightly and find the small Haghia Sophia with its nice garden (it was under restoration, but you probably can get in). Then uphill to the Sokollu Mehmet mosque complex, top notch tiles inside.
Take a tram or walk to EminÃ¶nÃ¼ (where the boats leave for trips to Asia or up the Bosphorus). Visit the New Mosque at the back, then the Egyptian Bazaar next to it, and going further in that direction, locate the RÃ¼stem Pasha mosque with its excellent tiles. It's on a raised platform near an old clothes market, you may have to ask directions. Then take a cab or find a bus to EyÃ¼p mosque complex, a mile or three up the Golden Horn. Visit this EyÃ¼p complex at your leisure (the mosque is not particular, the court is, and the milling of believers, with many boys-to-be-circumcised amongst it; a Friday might be a good day to do this). Then, if you have the stamina, it might be nice to walk back too; maybe all the way (five miles or so), but taking a route along part of the city wall to first the famous Kariye Church with its mosaics, then on to Selimiye Mosque with its great view on the Golden Horn (and a fine mosque by itself), then the Fatih Mosque (passing through some very religious and lively neighborhoods), then on to the well-restored Sehzade mosque, and next to SÃ¼leymaniye (don't forget to enjoy the view from the Golden Horn side). If you have some energy left, you might go on to the University complex, and by then you are very close to the Beyazit mosque. A book market (itâs small) is behind this good, unexceptional (nice courtyard though) mosque.
Once again go to EminÃ¶nÃ¼, but this time take the boat (those large ferries) to ÃskÃ¼dar. You will arrive before a fine mosque in front, another one four hundred meters off to the right, slightly inland behind a traffic roundabout, and a third, very small, at the sea front. See the market stretching inland, walk about and don't forget to walk along the shore, maybe eating a fish meal in one of the bobbing boats along it. This is a good visit for late afternoon, early evening, fleeing the city. You will be joined by thousands of people going home from "town" but the way back will be on a near-empty ferry. The frequency of ferries will go down in the evening, so make sure there is a connection back.
Go to the railroad station and find a Sirkeci-Halkali suburban train, and get out at (from memory, Yedikule station). You will be quite close to Yedikule, a nice fortress, and will have fine views of the city walls. The trains leave every 15 minutes or so, the ride is peculiar (the material is bad, but if you are in luck every second stop another salesman will enter and try selling his wares, itâs fun). The ride is takes anywhere from twenty minutes to half an hour. This is not a "must", but it can be great fun.
You will have missed the covered bazaar in all this. That is because you will get there anyhow. If you go to Beyazit and the book market you are almost at two of its many entrances. Try and find the Nuruosmaniye Mosque and its complex at the other side, itâs worth it. And after having explored the covered part, take a relaxing walk downhill, into the general direction of EminÃ¶nÃ¼, where it is "uncovered bazaar" all the way. Cross the Galata bridge to see some things on the Northern side (for instance take the "tÃ¼nel" teleferik ride up much of the hill (entrance close to the opposite side of Galata bridge, ask around)), then continue to Taksim. Shops are of the international variety.
From 408AD the original walls of Constantine were replaced in the reign of Theodosius. These walls then became the critical point of defence of the capital of the Eastern Roman Empire and their Ottoman successors. They are still almost completely intact, marking the western border of <a href="/en/Istanbul/Sultanahmet-Old_City" title="Istanbul/Sultanahmet-Old City">the peninsula of Old City</a>, with some sections suffering from somewhat unsightly restoration done in early 1990s. The section around the TopkapÄ± Gate (not to be confused with TopkapÄ± Palace which is located in an altogether different place) can be easily accessed from Pazartekke tram station, which lies about 300 metres east of the walls. Some remoter sections may not be very safe and may require some caution.
A 7 km walk along and on these remaining portions of the city wall offers a window into antiquity and puts emphasis on Turkeyâs terrible historic monument legacy. Download and print a scholarly historical and technical description of the walls before you visit Istanbul; this will certainly add to the pleasure. From EminÃ¶nÃ¼, take the Golden Horn ferry to Ayvansaray. This ferry terminal is separate from the Bosphorus terminals adjacent and east of the Galata Bridge. Walk west through the Galata bridge underpass, then through the bus station to a pedestrian laneway which leads to the small terminal building. The fare is TL 1.50. Leave the ferry at Ayvansaray and cross the park to the wall on the other side of the main road. You have a choice of walking up the outer wall or the inner wall but access to the top of the battlements is usually on the inside naturally enough, so go up the small street across the road which then cuts back behind the wall and the towers. Here you can climb up onto this section of unrestored wall on crumbling brick and stone and continue on some hundreds of yards climbing as necessary. This path comes to an obvious end and one can short cut back to the street. Sometimes there are dwellings and commercial enterprises hard up against the wall, sometimes a bus depot, a rubbish dump or often just the road. These walls replaced the earlier walls of Constantine in 408AD after which they went through constant upgrade and repairs to earthquake damage. The different work done over the centuries was all of varying style and quality. Quite surprisingly there are a number of small streets still using the narrow gates. At Hoca ÃakÄ±r Cd one comes across a restored section of the wall where the heights are accessed by stairs, some along the top of the wall of the steeper variety. This restoration from the 80s is in conflict with the original. The wall is then breached for the main road Fevzi PaÅa Cd. Cross this and continue along the street at the back of the wall. Look for foot pads and breaks in the wall which allows access and a good look around. The wall is breached again for Adnan Menderes Blv (unofficially and widely known as <i>Vatan Caddesi</i>). Past here one see here quite clearly the double line of defence with outer moat. The next breach is for Turgut Ãzal Cd (unofficially and widely known as <i>Millet Caddesi</i>) which hosts the tram line heading back to Sultanahmet for those who have run out of steam. Walking now on the outside of the walls, various breaks in the outer wall allow access via broken stonework or later via modern sets of steps in disrepair. Between the walls is the disquieting evidence of the number of people sleeping rough in Istanbul. Persevere in staying between the walls because soon you will arrive at another impure restoration project at MevlanakapÄ± Cd gate. Note that entry to the gate towers has been closed at the gate, so entry is only from the walls. From here it is better to proceed on the outside of the walls because market gardens occupy the moat and the city side abuts buildings. These couple of kms will give a further perspective of the ravages of time and earthquake on the walls. Finally you will arrive at the Golden Gate and <a href="/en/Istanbul/Sultanahmet-Old_City#Yedikule_Fortress" title="Istanbul/Sultanahmet-Old City">Yedikule Fortress</a> which fronts the Marmara Sea and was Byzantiumâs triumphal point of entry. This is in excellent condition not least because the Ottomans upgraded it and then used it right up to the 19th century. There is an entry fee and it boasts a loo. The high walls and towers are all accessible, and one tower still has internal wooden floors. So you have now surveyed the protective land walls which kept Byzantium and the Eastern Roman Empire safe for all those years after the fall of Rome, breached only by the 4th Crusaders and the Ottomans. What of their future? Given that recent restoration work is fairly suspect scholars may think it is better to leave them be. Now return to the city either in the EminÃ¶nÃ¼ Bus (#80) from the village square outside the main gate, just wait there, or walk down Yedikule Istasyonu Cd about 300m to the railway line to Sirkeci, both heading for centres close to Sultanahmet.
Around the city you will see various touts for private companies offering Bosphorous cruises for â¬30 or more, often disappointingly short in duration and on rickety boats. A safer, cheaper and more reliable option is to take the official Bosphorous cruise from the state-run company Sehir Hatlari <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.sehirhatlari.com.tr/en/">[15]</a> which offers a three hour cruise for TL25 (90 minutes each way with a break of several hours at Anadoli Kavagi) or a shorter non-stop 2 hour cruise for TL10. 
From the EminÃ¶nÃ¼ terminal immediately east of the Galata Bridge starts the large ferry cruising to Anadolu Kavagi at the northern entrance of Bosphorus to the Black Sea via various stops. The fare is TL 25. The departure time is early (there are three daily departures during the high season) and is very popular, so arrive early and queue. The open decks are hugely popular, so unless you have an outside seat expect people to be standing all around you constricting the view. The ferry waits some hours in Anadolu Kavagi so as you alight you are confronted by a numerous restaurants and their spruikers. Firstly take the (very steep) walk to the Yoros Kalesi, a strategic castle overlooking and controlling the entry to the Black Sea. This important fortification with a commanding view has been fought over for many years and was last in use in the 19th century. It has fallen into serious disrepair, but Christian engravings are still visible in the stonework. There are restaurants actually in the castle surrounds and naturally have spectacular views. There is plenty of time left to wander back to the village for lunch. It is late afternoon before arrival back at Eminonu, but a day well spent. A cheaper and faster Bosphorus cruise alternative is a TL 10 trip on a shorter cruise.
Football (soccer) is the most popular sport in Turkey, and Turkish football fans are known for their passion. Many teams from other parts of Europe consider the atmosphere to be very intimidating when they have to play away matches in Turkey. The most intense rivalries in Turkish football are between <b>BeÅiktaÅ</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://bjk.com.tr">[16]</a>, <b>FenerbahÃ§e</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://fenerbahce.org">[17]</a>, and <b>Galatasaray</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://galatasaray.org">[18]</a>, and matches between these sides are always played in front of sell-out crowds;  getting tickets requires booking way in advance. As the atmosphere is extremely hostile to the away teams, spectators should avoid wearing away team colours after the match, and avoid any signs of crowd trouble.
Many foreigners visiting or living in Istanbul decide to study Turkish formally in a language school. Some of the biggest and most respected Turkish language schools in Istanbul are:
Both BoÄaziÃ§i University and Bilgi University <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://bilgi.edu.tr/">[24]</a> have well established <b>Study Abroad</b> programs in English for foreigners.
If you already speak Turkish, <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Turkish_language" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Ottoman Turkish language">Ottoman Turkish</a></b> may also be interesting to learn. Ottoman Turkish was the courtly form of Turkish spoken during the era of the Ottoman Empire, and is significantly different to the form of Turkish spoken today. Approximately 80% of Ottoman Turkish words were loanwords from other languages, mostly Arabic, Persian and French. After the fall of the Ottoman Empire and the establishment of the Republic of Turkey, language reforms were implemented, including the establishment of the <i>TÃ¼rk Dil Kurumu</i> (Turkish Language Association), which is the official regulatory body of the Turkish language. This association, with a philosophy of linguistic purism, decided to cleanse the Turkish language of loanwords and replace them with more Turkic alternatives. As such, only about 14% of modern Turkish words are of foreign origin.
Ottoman Turkish is the key to learning about Turkey's Ottoman past. With Ottoman Turkish, not only can you read historical archives, but you can also read Ottoman literature and letters dated back to the Ottoman period. In Istanbul, you can learn Ottoman Turkish from the following places:
There is always demand for qualified ESOL/EFL teachers in Istanbul. Most teachers work with private instructional companies or private schools. Private schools are notorious for the spoiled, nouveau riche families that send their children there and remember: you, the teacher, are always wrong and the student always right at such establishments. The days when a would-be English teacher teacher without a certificate could get a job, however, are long gone, even  for under the table jobs. While Istanbul may seem charming to a first-time visitor, actually living in a city that has far more people than it was designed to support is simply excruciating after a while, and the turnover rate is exceptionally high. Also keep in mind that the market is quite saturated. You will probably find a job, but not a very good one. Most English teachers work under the table and pay is generally poor, just enough to scrape by. Late payment is not uncommon, and there are plenty of horror stories of  bosses cheating their employees. If you must live and teach in Turkey, go to a smaller city where you will be in higher demand and the cost of living is lower.
Connecting east and west, the will to control the major trading routes was the reason why Istanbul was founded in the first place, so shopping should definitely not be overlooked in your Istanbul experience.
The currency used in Istanbul is the Turkish Lira (TL) though the euro and US dollar are also accepted at places frequented by tourists (although certain tourist attractions such as the Hagia Sophia only accept liras). Currency exchanges (<i>dÃ¶viz bÃ¼rosu</i>) and banks are plentiful in Istanbul and offer extremely competitive exchange rates with no commission charged. If you are planning to visit Istanbul, bring hard foreign currency and exchange them after you arrive, preferably at a bank or a currency exchange. Exchange only what you need as you will find difficulty exchanging your leftover TL back to foreign currency after you leave the country. Alternatively, withdraw money from ATMs whenever you need cash.
Shops may be closed on Sundays.  Most major shopping malls have security checkpoints you usually see in airports and museums prior to entry.
Istanbul's historical <b>bazaars</b> with an oriental ambiance, once sitting firmly on the western terminii of the <a href="/en/Silk_Road" title="Silk Road">Silk Road</a> and spice routes, all dating back to Ottoman era, are all located in the <a href="/en/Istanbul/Sultanahmet-Old_City" title="Istanbul/Sultanahmet-Old City">the peninsula of Old City</a>. However, expect extreme price rises in the Grand Bazaar as it's become a mere tourist attraction.  Just moving by few meters outside of it you can see prices drop quickly. If you plan on shopping a lot, a flight to Gaziantep (which can be quite cheap) may be worth it.
On the other hand, <b>modern shopping malls</b> (<i>alÄ±ÅveriÅ merkezi</i>, usually shortened to <i>AVM</i>), popping all around the city in the last three decades, are mostly to be found in <a href="/en/Istanbul/New_City" title="Istanbul/New City">New Istanbul</a> and <a href="/en/Istanbul/Western_Suburbs" title="Istanbul/Western Suburbs">western suburbs</a>, though they are by no means exclusively located in these districts.
If you are after top quality upmarket garments, then you may better head for <a href="/en/Istanbul/New_City" title="Istanbul/New City">NiÅantaÅÄ±</a> in European Side and <a href="/en/Istanbul/Asian_Side" title="Istanbul/Asian Side">BaÄdat Avenue</a> in Asian Side.
Here are some of what are popular to buy while in the city:
For individual restaurant listings, check <a href="/en/Istanbul#Districts" title="Istanbul">district</a> articles.
When having a look for a restaurant, there will be a lot of restaurants, where the staff will try to make one come inside. There is really a kind of competition between the restaurants to make one come inside. However, the best restaurants are not always the expansive tourist restaurants, but those small Lokantas where even the turkish people go for having dinner.
In general, it is possible to find some kind of accommodation in any <a href="/en/Istanbul#Districts" title="Istanbul">district</a> of Istanbul. Here is a quick list of the districts where they are concentrated most:
Istanbul is the only city/province in Turkey which has more than one telephone code: <b>212</b> for European side, <b>216</b> for Asian side and Princesâ Islands. When calling from one continent to the other, the usual dialing format used for intercity calls should be used, as if itâs an intercity call: <i>0+area code (212 or 216)+7-digit telephone number</i>. It may appear as an intercity call, but it will be treated as a local call in respect to payment. When making an intercontinental call, if you forget to dial the code, your call will <i>not</i> be automatically routed to the other continent number, it is likely that you will be connected to the âwrongâ number which is in the same continent with you, because much of the number sets are used on both continents (albeit with different codes of course). When dialing a number that is on the continent you are already standing on, only 7-digit number is enough. Donât forget to dial the code first no matter which continent you are in if you are calling a landline number from a cell phone (even if itâs a number that is in the same continent with you), though.
Prepaid SIM cards can be bought (for around 30 TL with 5TL usable balance) at Vodafone, Avea or Turkcell kiosks at the airport or in shops around town. They might ask to make a copy of your passport.
However, to be able to use your phone you need to get it unlocked for use in Turkey. This process takes up to 4 days so getting a SIM isn't really practical for people on a short visit.
CafÃ©s with free wireless internet (wi-fi):
In the recent years, the number of cafes and shopping centers with wi fi Internet access has increased dramatically, most of them still being free. Most internet cafes have high speed ADSL connections, and they are very inexpensive compared to Europe (about 0.50-1.50 Euros per hour).
As with most European cities, but especially in crowded areas of Istanbul, watch your pockets and travel documents as pickpockets have devised all sorts of strategies to obtain them from you. Do not rely too much on the 'safe' feeling you get from the omnipresence of policemen. Taksim Square, Sultanahmet Square, Istiklal Avenue, Kadikoy Square etc. are observed by security cameras monitored by police 24/7 non-stop.
Also be wary of men in Taksim who splash water on the backs of your neck. When you turn around, they will try to start a fight with you as another man comes in and robs you. These men tend to carry knives and can be very dangerous.
Istanbul is home to three of the biggest clubs in Turkey and arguably European football: BeÅiktaÅ, FenerbahÃ§e, and Galatasaray. It is advisable not to wear colours associating yourself with any of the clubs--black and white, blue and yellow, and red and yellow, respectively--particularly on the days of matches between the sides due to the fearsome rivalry they share.
Be respectful of the Turkish flag. Don't put it on places where people sit or stand, don't drag it, don't wrinkle it, don't contaminate it, don't use it as a dress or uniform. Not only will Turks be very offended, furthermore the desecration of the Turkish flag is a punishable offence. The flag is extremely important and well respected in Turkey.

Below are scams that have been reported. They may be discouraging; however, of all these scams, the most common is the overpriced taxis, which also happens to be the most common scam in the world. In other words, use traveler's common sense and caution and you'll be safe. And do not be afraid of the police; if you think you are being scammed or robbed, the police will take the utmost care of you.
When walking through the gates of the Blue Mosque, beware of smiling, friendly chaps who offer immediately to be your de-facto guide through the mosque and its surroundings; while they are informative on just about anything relating to the mosque--etiquette, history, Islamic practices--they eventually demand a price for their "services", a quotation that can be as high as 50TL (about EUR 25 or GBP 20). One would be better off booking a private tour online; or not at all, since the mosque is essentially free to all anyway.
Be aware of high-drink price <a href="/en/Scams" title="Scams" class="mw-redirect">scams</a> in "night-clubs" (located mostly in Aksaray, Beyazit and Taksim areas). These clubs can charge overpriced bills (hundreds or thousands of lira) based on a replica of the original menu or even simply a menu lying upside down on the table.
Be <b>especially</b> aware of "friendly" young men/groups of young men/male-female couples inviting you to a "good nightclub they know"---this is frequently a prelude to a scam. Scammers often work to earn your trust, striking up a conversation or even taking you to a legitimate restaurant and covering the bill. In another variation, the scammer will talk to you in Turkish, and when you reply in your own language, they will be "surprised" you're not Turkish and offer to repay you for their accident with a beer. Note that some scammers are very, very patient, working for hours to gain your trust before finally taking you to a bar.
In any of these scams, if you refuse to pay the high prices or try to call the police (dial #155), the club managers may resort to physical intimidation. In general, use caution: scams in Taksim are becoming more serious, and organized crime may be involved.
The following tips will not guarantee protection from bar/club scams, but may help you avoid the most common traps:
If you are caught by scammers and faced with an impossible bill, keep the following in mind:
The following is not meant to be comprehensive; it is meant to increase overall awareness by giving you a sense of the diversity of scams that people have encountered. Once again: caution, common sense, and situational awareness are your best friends.
<b>When a specific establishment is listed here, it is advisable to go elsewhere</b>--not only to avoid scams, but to also help end them. Be sure to know the name of any establishment you're entering; scam clubs sometimes deploy hard-to-see signage.
A frequent scam, often in smaller hotels (but it can also happen in a variety of other contexts), is to quote prices in Lira and then later, when payment is due, claim the price was given in Euros. Hotels which reject payment early in a stay and prefer you to "pay when you leave" should raise suspicions. Hotels which operate this scam often  offer excellent service and accommodation at a reasonable price and know most guests will conclude as much and pay without complaint - thus (ironically) this can be a sign of a good hotel.
Another scam is coin-related and happens just as you're walking into the streets.  A Turkish guy holds you and asks where you are from.  If you mention a Euro-country, the guy wants you to change a â¬50 note from you into two-Euro coins he is showing.  He is holding the coins stack-wise in his hands.  For the trouble, he says he will offer you '30 two-Euro coins, making â¬60 in total'.  Do not agree with this exchange of money, as the first coin is indeed a two-Euro coin, but (many of) the rest of the coins will probably be 1 Lira coins (looking very similar), but worth only 1/4 of the value of â¬2.
Many bars in the Taksim area give you counterfeit bills. They are usually well-made and hard to identify as fakes in the dark. One way to verify its authenticity is to check its size against another bill. Another is to hold the bill up to a strong light, face side up, and check for an outline of the same face which is on the bill. The value of the bill (20, 50, etc) should appear next to the outline, light and translucent. If either if these two security features are missing, try to have the bill changed or speak to the police.
Some people will walk around Taksim (or other tourist-frequented areas) with a shoeshine kit, and the brush will fall off. This is a scam to cause some Western tourist with a conscience to pick it up and return it to the owner, who will then express gratitude and offer to shine your shoes for free. While doing that, he will talk about how he is from another city and how he has a sick child. At the end, the shiner will demand a much higher price for the "free" services provided than is the actual market norm.
Another type of scam is used especially by children-shoebrushers. On rainy days they act like they dropped and broke their shoeshine kit and literally paint the floor, then they start to cry and sob. Then, they wait for some emotional people (especially tourists)to help them and/or pay them.
If you actively decide that you would like your shoes shined, then expect to pay not more than 5 lira for both.
Taxis are plentiful in Istanbul and inexpensive by Western European and American standards.  They can be picked up at taxi hubs throughout the city or on the streets.  Empty cabs on the streets will honk at pedestrians to see if they would like a ride, or cabs can be hailed by pedestrians by making eye contact with the driver and waving.  Few taxi drivers speak languages other than Turkish, but do a fair job at deciphering mispronounced location names given by foreign riders. It is advisable to have the name of the destination written down and try to have a map beforehand to show the driver, to avoid any misunderstanding and also potential scams.  Though taxis are plentiful, be aware that taxis are harder to find during peak traffic hours and traffic jams and when it is raining and snowing. They are also less frequent during nights, depending on the area and and are hard to find after midnight.
Try to avoid using taxis for short distances (5-10 minutes of walk) if possible. Some taxi drivers can be annoyed with this, especially if you called the cab from a taxi hub instead of hailing it from the street. If you want taxis for short distances, just hail them from the street, do not go to the taxi hub.
Few taxis have seatbelts, and some drivers may seem to be reckless.  If you wish for the driver to slow down, say "yavash lÃ¼tfen" (slow please).  Your request may or may not be honored.
Unfortunately, as in any major city, tourists are more vulnerable to taxi scams than locals.  Be aware that taxi drivers use cars affiliated with a particular hub, and that the name and phone number of the hub, as well as the license plate number, are written on the side of each car.  Noting or photographing this information may be useful if you run into problems.  In general, riding in taxis affiliated with major hotels (Hilton, Marriot, Ritz, etc.) is safe, and it is not necessary to stay in these hotels to use a taxis leaving from their hubs.
Others may take unnecessarily long routes to increase the amount due (although sometimes alternate routes are also taken to avoid Istanbul traffic, which can be very bad).  Some scams involve the payment transaction; for example, if the rider pays 50 TL when only 20 TL are needed, the driver may quickly switch it with a 5 TL note and insist that the rest of the 20 TL is still due or may switch the real bill for a fake one and insist that different money be given.
Methods to avoid taxi scams:
1. <b>SIT IN THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT</b>. Watch the meter. Watch the driver's actions (beeping the horn, pumping the brakes, etc) and note what the taximeter does. While it is rare, some drivers will wire parts of their controls to increase the fare upon activation. If you're with your significant other, <b>do it anyway</b>. Save the cuddling for after the ride. Check if the seal on the taximeter is broken. Use your phone for light. This will make the driver realize that you are cautious. Be very careful when the driver touches the meter or when you can't see the meter. Challenge the driver right away to see if there's any unusual jumps in the price. Note that for women it is better to sit in the back seat (where you can see the meter from the middle), as there are occassionally problems with taxi drivers getting overly friendly, and sitting in the front is a sign that a woman welcomes such behavior.
2. <b>Ask "How much to go to...?" (basic English is understood), before getting in the taxi</b>. Price will be quite accurate to the one in the taximeter at the end of the ride. If the price sounds ok for you, get in the cab and tell them to put the Taximeter on. Since 2009, the rate they are applying is same during night and day. Also you can use this useful and up-to-date cab fare estimation tool for Istanbul: <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://taksiyle.com/en/">[28]</a>
3. <b>Know the route.</b> If you have a chance, find a map and demand that the driver take your chosen route to the destination. Often times they will drive the long way or pretend not to know where you're going in order to get more money out of you. If the driver claims not to know the route to a major landmark or gathering place, refuse his services as he is likely lying.
4. <b>Choose an elderly driver.</b> Elderly taxi drivers are less likely to cheat passengers.
5. Let taxi driver see money on your hands and show values and take commitment on it. This is 50 Lira. OK? Take this 50 Lira and give 30 Lira back OK?. This guarantees your money value. Otherwise, your 50 Lira can be 5 Lira immediately on his hands. Try to have always 10 Lira or 20 Lira bills in your wallet. This makes money scams in general more difficult. If you realize that the driver tried to use the 50 Lira to 5 Lira trick on you, call the police (#155) immediately and write down the license plate.
6. Create a big scene if there is a problem. If you are absolutely positive you have been subject to a scam, threaten to or call the police and, if you feel it will help, start yelling. Taxi drivers will only rip off those they think will fall for it; creating a scene draws attention to them and will make it easier to pay the correct rate.
Watch the menu carefully in street cafes for signs that prices are not discriminatory â if prices are clearly over-inflated, simply leave. A good indication of over inflation is the circulation of two different types of menu â the "foreigner" menu is typically printed on a laminated card with menu prices written in laundry marker/texta, i.e., prices not be printed; in these cases, expect that prices for foreigners will be highly inflated (300% or higher).
While this is not really a problem in <a href="/en/Istanbul/Galata" title="Istanbul/Galata">BeyoÄlu</a> or <a href="/en/Istanbul/Bosphorus" title="Istanbul/Bosphorus">OrtakÃ¶y</a>, avoiding the open air cafes toward the rear courtyard of the Spice Bazaar (<a href="/en/Istanbul/Sultanahmet-Old_City" title="Istanbul/Sultanahmet-Old City">Sultanahmet</a>) is wise. The area immediately north of the Spice Bazaar is also crawling with touts for these 'infamous' cafes.
Having nargile (water pipe) is a famous activity in Istanbul,Tophane(top-hane)is a famous location for this activity where a huge number of nargile shops are available and can easily be reached by the tram, avoiding a place called "Ali Baba" in Tophane is wise , usually you will be served there with plates you did not ask for like a nuts plate , and expect to have a bill of around 50$ for your nargile&#160;!
Men intent on stalking foreign women may be present in tourist locations.  Such men may presume that foreigners have a lot of money or liberal values and may approach foreign women in a flirtatious or forward manner looking for sex or for money (either by theft or selling over-priced goods).  If you are being harassed, use common sense and go to where other people are; often this is the nearest store.  Creating a public scene will deter many stalkers, and these phrases may be useful in such cases:
Or to really ruin him:
Occasionally try not to use Turkish as the stalker will like it more, just scream and run and find a safer place with crowd and police.
Istanbul PD has a "Tourism Police" department where travelers may report passport loss and theft or any other criminal activity by which they are victimized. They have an office in <a href="/en/Istanbul/Sultanahmet-Old_City" title="Istanbul/Sultanahmet-Old City">Sultanahmet</a> and can reportedly speak English, German, French, and Arabic.
Tap water may not be safe depending on where you drink it. Although the tap water itself is clean, many local water tanks are not maintained properly, and one should try to avoid tap water if possible. Locals widely prefer bottled water and the same applies for the restaurants.  Expect to pay for water in restaurants (around 2TL).
Food and drinks are mostly of international standards. Some Turkish foods are known to use a variety of spices which may affect international tourists who may not be accustomed to such ingredients, although most of it is edible for any tongue.
Use common sense when buying certain foods, particularly from street vendors. Delicacies such as "Firin Sutlac" (a kind of rice pudding) can go bad rapidly on a hot day, as can the oysters occasionally for sale on the streets.
Keep in mind that Istanbul's less-than-scrupulous hotel and restaurant owners are as market savvy as they comeâthey actually read the popular travel guides to Istanbul and when they get listed or favorably reviewed, they raise prices through the roof and skimp on costs. For mid-range and cheap hotels/restaurants, you may actually have a better time if you <b>avoid places listed in your guide.</b> Trust your nose.
Istanbul's mosques are beautiful and safe to visit provided you're dressed appropriately and cover what you're supposed to cover, and the locals welcome outsiders.
Istanbul is geographically huge, spanning two continents, so it is hard to hit the road with your thumb up immediately, although not entirely impossible. Here are a few ideas for spots (accessible by public transport) where to raise your thumb up when leaving the city.
