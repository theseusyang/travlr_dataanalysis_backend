<b>Chiang Mai</b> (à¹à¸à¸µà¸¢à¸à¹à¸«à¸¡à¹) is the hub of <a href="/en/North_(Thailand)" title="North (Thailand)" class="mw-redirect">Northern Thailand</a>. With a population of over 170,000 in the city proper (but more than 1 million in the metropolitan area), it is Thailand's fifth-largest city. Located on a plain at an elevation of 316&#160;m, surrounded by mountains and lush countryside, it is much greener and quieter than the capital, and has a cosmopolitan air and a significant expat population, factors which have led many from Bangkok to settle permanently in this "Rose of the North".
Founded in 1296 CE, Chiang Mai is a culturally and historically interesting city, at one time the capital of the ancient Lanna kingdom. Located among the rolling foothills of the Himalayan Mountains 700 km north of Bangkok, it could only be reached by an arduous river journey or an elephant trek until the 1920s. This isolation helped keep Chiang Mai's distinctive charm intact.
Chiang Mai's historical centre is the <b>walled city</b> (<i>city</i> is <i>chiang</i> in the northern Thai dialect while <i>mai</i> is <i>new</i>, hence <i>Chiang Mai</i> or <i>New City</i>.) Sections of the wall dating to their restoration a few decades ago remain at the gates and corners, but of the rest only the moat remains.
Inside Chiang Mai's remaining city walls are more than 30 temples dating back to the founding of the principality, in a combination of Burmese, Sri Lankan and Lanna Thai styles, decorated with beautiful wood carvings, Naga staircases, leonine and angelic guardians, gilded umbrellas and pagodas laced with gold filigree. The most famous is Wat Phrathat Doi Suthep, which overlooks the city from a mountainside 13 km away.
Modern-day Chiang Mai has expanded in all directions, but particularly to the east towards the <b>Ping River</b> (<i>Mae Nam Ping</i>), where Chang Klan Rd, the famous <b>Night Bazaar</b> and the bulk of Chiang Mai's hotels and guest houses are located. <b>Loi Kroh Rd</b> is the centre of the city's night life. The locals say you've not experienced Chiang Mai until you've seen the view from Doi Suthep, eaten a bowl of kao soi, and purchased an umbrella from Bo Sang. Of course this is touristic nonsense, but the Kao Soi, Bo Sang umbrellas, and Doi Suthep are important cultural icons for Chiang Mai residents. <b>Ratchadamneon Rd</b> hosts the main Sunday night walking street market from Tha Phae Gate to the popular Wat Phra Singh.
Chiang Mai's northern location and moderate elevation results in the city having a more temperate climate than that of the south.
As with the rest of Thailand there are three seasons.
<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.chiangmaiairportonline.com/">Chiang Mai International Airport</a> (<b>CNX</b>) handles both domestic and regional international flights. The route from Bangkok is one of the busiest in the country (Thai Airways flies daily almost every hour, with additional flights in the peak tourist season). Other airlines operating direct services from/to Chiang Mai include:
The airport is some 3 km southwest of the city centre, only 10-15 minutes away by car. Legal airport taxis charge a flat 120 baht for up to 5 passengers anywhere in the city; if you take a metered taxi, the fee will start from 40 baht + a 50 baht service fee from the Meter Taxi counter. The taxis operate from the exit at the north end of the terminal, after baggage claim and/or customs, walk into the reception hall and turn left. Alternatively, take bus #4 to the city centre for 15 baht, or charter a tuk-tuk or songthaew for 50-60 baht per person. Most hotels and some upmarket guesthouses offer cheap or free pick-up/drop-off services.
Chiang Mai has two official bus stations, consisting of 3 terminals:
A variety of daily buses leave frequently from <a href="/en/Bangkok/Phahonyothin#By_bus" title="Bangkok/Phahonyothin">Bangkok's Northern Bus Terminal (Mo Chit)</a>, offering varying choices of price, comfort and speed.
At Arcade Bus Station, where you'll arrive, public songthaews wait nearer Terminal 3, adjacent to the road that bisects the two terminals. Look for local people getting into them, and ask the driver if he goes to your destination (if the songthaew is empty, don't forget to confirm the price). A shared trip to Tha Phae Gate (south edge of the old town) should cost 20 baht each, though you may have to wait for a driver who agrees. Virtually all songthaews will pass Warorot Market (city centre, just after crossing the river), from where it's just 1 km walk to Tha Phae Gate, or numerous (see "Get around" section) songthaews to other areas.
Alternatively, you can charter the whole songthaew or take a tuk-tuk. The drivers will approach you once you've arrived and will ask as much as 80-100 baht to the city centre/Tha Phae Gate, showing you a bogus price list with "fixed" prices. Bargain, it's just 5-6 km, so the fair price for tuk-tuk there is 50 baht, and is not more than 100 baht even to the opposite side of the city. It may be difficult to bargain with these drivers, however. A good idea is to ignore them from the start, walk out to the nearby street, and catch a passing tuk-tuk/songthaew there. If your luggage is light, you can walk to the centre, but it's quite a long walk, as the Arcade bus station is located in the city's northeast outskirts.
Songthaew touts may ask foreign tourists for an outrageous 150 baht per person for a shared ride to town. Challenged, they will drop to 100 baht. Similar prices are demanded by tuk-tuk drivers.
The best policy is to walk to the main street and catch a tuk-tuk for perhaps 60 baht, or a songthaew for perhaps 30 baht per person. You will have to haggle for either.
Services from Bangkok's [<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Bangkok#By_train">[13]</a>] leave on a regular daily schedule <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.railway.co.th/English/Time_HTML.asp">[14]</a> and take 12-15 hours to reach Chiang Mai. If you go by night train (recommended), try to choose one which arrives late to get an opportunity to see the landscapes. They are really impressive, with bridges and forest and villages and fields.
<b>Daytime services</b> leave at 08:30, and 14:30 with second-class (281 baht) and third-class (121 baht) carriages. The seats in each class differ in softness and width and can become uncomfortable after 10+ hours.
<b>Overnight sleepers</b> provide comfortable bunks with clean sheets and pillows in first- and second-class. First-class beds (~1,400 baht) are in private two-bed compartments; in some trains first class compartments have only one berth and cost 500 baht more than usual, and whole compartments can be booked for single occupancy for the same amount. In second-class (~900 baht), the carriages are open but each bunk has a curtain for privacy. First-class is always air-con, second class is sometimes air-con. There are usually four trains per day with sleeper accommodation, though only two of these will have first-class compartments. Station staff will be able to help you.
Carriages are kept clean; the toilet and floors are regularly mopped during the journey. Vendors make regular rounds selling snacks, drinks and lacklustre meals. Vendors will try to inflate the prices for tourists so be prepared to get ripped off, haggle, hop off quickly at stations or bring your own.
In second-class, the bunks are folded away leaving pairs of facing seats. At some point in the evening, or on request, they get flipped down into bunks and made up into beds. In first-class, the bottom bunk is used as a bench seat before having a futon mattress deployed onto it in the evening.
If you're not in the mood for bed when your carriage mates are bedding down, you can head off to the dining car, which provides fairly good food and drink at not too great a premium. Later in the night, the dining car can turn into a disco, complete with loud music and flashing lights.
<b>Tickets</b> can be bought up to 60 days in advance at any station in Thailand. Booking in advance is advised, especially for the popular 2nd-class overnight sleepers. Larger stations accept payment with Visa/MasterCard. This is fairly safe, as SRT is a state-owned company. The online e-ticket service was discontinued February 14, 2013, and tickets must now be obtained at the stations, though you can still check availability on-line. 1st and 2nd class air-con sleeper tickets are 150-200 baht more expensive than fan-only car tickets. Various travel agencies, some available to contact from outside Thailand, can also procure tickets for delivery or pick up, with fees typically starting at 100 baht.
SRT charges 90 baht to transport a bicycle between <a href="/en/Bangkok" title="Bangkok">Bangkok</a> and Chiang Mai.
<b>Chiang Mai train station</b> is about 3 km east of the city centre. Plentiful songthaews and tuk-tuks await each train's arrival. If you want to walk, exit the station, cross the open square in front and turn left on the first major road you come to (Charoen Muang Rd); this road goes directly to city centre.
Chiang Mai did have a nice new large air conditioned bus service. These were all over the major city routes but have been discontinued until 2011. There are pedicabs called <i>samlor</i>; the 3-wheeled <i>tuk-tuk</i>; and the most popular, the <i>songthaew</i>.
In lieu of a local bus service, locals get around the city on <i>songthaew</i> (à¸ªà¸­à¸à¹à¸à¸§). These covered pick-up trucks have two long bench seats in the back (<i>songthaew</i> means "two rows" in Thai), and travel fixed routes picking up passengers en route who are going the same way. Some can also be hired outright.
The colour of the songthaew indicates its general route or usage. Most common by far are <b>red</b> songthaews (called <i>rod daeng</i>, <i>red</i> truck), which don't follow a specific route and roam the main streets around markets, temples, or the bus/train stations. These are the most convenient to take if you are going somewhere specific. Prices must be negotiated. but expect 20 baht anywhere within the city walls and 40-60 baht outside.  However, most drivers will initially quote tourists prices of 100 baht for locations outside the city walls, locals will pay up to 40 baht for the same journey. Because of the city's somewhat irrational road design, especially inside the old walls, the driver may be forced to take a circuitous route to get to a nearby destination, but it will make no difference in the fare.
<b>Fixed route songthaews</b> congregate around Warorot Market. From Warorot Market, <b>white</b> songthaews travel to the eastern suburban city of Sankampaeng, <b>yellow</b> songthaews travel to Mae Rim in the north, <b>blue</b> songthaews travel to Sarapee and Lamphun in the south, and <b>green</b> songthaews travel to Mae Jo in the northeast. They all charge a 20 baht flat rate.
From Pratu Chiang Mai Market, songthaews also travel to Hang Dong (20 baht) and San Patong, southwest of Chiang Mai.
<b>To catch a songthaew</b>; approach a waiting driver or flag one down on the street, state your destination and if the driver is going that direction he will nod in agreement and give you a price. Negotiate a lower fare if you wish. The price agreed to should be <i>per person</i>; it's a good idea to confirm this with the driver before you leave. On reaching your destination, ring the buzzer on the roof to tell the driver to stop, or most likely the driver will pull over, wait for you to get out and pay.
<b>Tuk-tuks</b> are a quick, though noisy way to get around. Fares are usually 30-40 baht for a short hop (as of July 2012 it seems that the minimum has gone up to 40 baht for pre-arranged locations) and 50-100 baht for longer distances, depending on the proficiency of your bargaining. As a guide, <b>expect to pay</b> 40 baht from the old city to the riverside and Night Bazaar, 40-50 baht to the railway station, and 80-100 baht to the bus station or airport. Tuk-tuks parked near the bus and train stations will ask you for something like 120-150 baht. Just haggle or walk away to the nearest road and stop a passing tuk-tuk or songthaew there.
According to expats, the highest fee for a tuk-tuk at any time of day or night should be 150 baht for any location in town.
The fee seems to be based on multiples of 20 baht which is the smallest note. It is a good idea to stock up on notes and coins as whenever you offer a note higher than the agreed fee the driver has no change!
A few <b>samlor</b> (three-wheeled bicycles) still cruise the streets and will happily take you to a temple for the same price as a tuk-tuk, though at a considerably quieter and slower pace.
Chiang Mai has metered taxis, though it can be difficult to persuade the driver to switch the meter on. If you do prevail, the <b>flag fall</b> is 30 baht for the first 2 km, then 10-15 baht/km after that. Otherwise you will have resort to bargaining a fare. You cannot generally hail taxis in the street. To <b>book a taxi</b> try:
Or contact individual drivers via the mobile phone numbers displayed on their vehicles.
A motorbike is a convenient and cheap way to get around town or reach the outlying sights. There are an abundance of nearly indistinguishable rental outfits in town, and most guest houses can arrange rentals. Automatic 110cc and 125cc bikes capable of carrying two people are the easiest to jump on and ride away with if you don't have riding experience, but off-road bikes and larger street bikes are also an option. A valid international drivers licence isn't required to rent.
Motorbikes run about 150 baht/day for a 110cc motorbike and 150+ baht/day for a Honda Wave 125; supplied with helmets and a security chain. If you rent longer term, e.g., by the month, those rates can be as low as 2,400 to 2,700 baht per month, averaging 80-90 baht per day. Several dealers will agree to these rates. Currently a Honda PCX rents for 350-500 baht per day in the city centre. Monthly rates may lower the daily average.
Larger machines cost 700 baht/day for a V-twin chopper or larger sport-bike. Expect discounts when renting for a week, month, or longer.
Rentals will require a deposit (generally prudent opinion would say that while many ask for a passport you should <b>under no circumstances</b> leave your passport [with anyone] as collateral). It is recommended that you use your discretion to make this assessment as reputable vendors will cause no problems leaving the passport for a month each time. Remember that if you want to leave the country you will need the passport; and that you must ALWAYS carry a photocopy of the passport and visa/entry stamp pages. In this case an additional photo ID isn't a bad idea. Most shops will accept a photocopy with a cash deposit of around 3,000-5,000 baht. This is a much better alternative. While the petrol/gas tank may be full on pick-up, it is not uncommon for shops to deliver a bike with just enough fuel to go make it to a service station. In any case, return the bike with as much or more fuel than received to avoid any penalties. Also check out the relative mechanical merit of the bike being offered. Focus especially on the brakes, the degree of "pull" needed for the handlebar lever, and the travel needed for the foot brake. Check that indicators and  headlights work properly, and the tires are reasonably OK.
Some rental agreements claim to <b>insure</b> you but generally only cover the bike for theft or damage. Don't expect much in the way of compensation if something bad such as an accident occurs. Regardless of who is at fault, assume that you will be considered the guilty party.
The police frequently fine riders (including passengers) 500 baht (some officers will allow you to pay 100 or 200 baht on the spot "to avoid paperwork and travelling to the station, etc.") for not wearing a helmet, plus you usually have to go to the police station the next day to collect your licence.
Some motorcycle rental shops:
Tawan Motor, 84/7 Sridonchai Rd., 053-271546, 087-3017848, the owner of the shop is relaxed and fair, and does not worry about minor scratches
Traffic inside the old city walls is subdued enough to make biking a safe and quick way to get around. Bike rentals are plentiful; rental costs 30-250 baht/day depending on the bike quality.
Car hire services are available both in the city centre and at the airport. Cars typically offered include the Toyota Vios, Altis, and Yaris, and the Honda City and Jazz. Typical rates for newer models are 1,200-2,000 baht per day. Expect a slight discount when renting weekly. Utility pickups such as the Toyota Hilux or Fortuner SUV are also available. Many places offer minivans such as 10-seat Toyota Commuters with a driver from about 2,000 baht per day plus fuel. Older Suzuki Carribean 4WDs are a cheaper option at around 600-800 baht per day, but they are relatively difficult to drive and less mechanically reliable than a standard passenger car.
Some car rental companies in Chiang Mai:
The old city is only a mile square, and as such is easy to walk around. The airport is also quite close to the old part of town--about 2.5 km--so if you have the energy and an hour to spare, you can even walk to and from the airport. Note that this is not necessarily a pleasant experience as the sidewalks are uneven (or non-existent) and Chiang Mai gets hot during the day, especially during the hot season, and rainy during the rainy season. The cost of a taxi or songthaew from the moat area to the airport is around 150 baht.
This is is a great option for travelling to places outside Chiang Mai city, and the price is often similar to hiring a car and driving yourself. You'll also be able to relax and enjoy the scenery in air-conditioned comfort. The cost for a private car with driver is generally from 1,500 baht per day plus fuel depending on the type of vehicle and where you are going. The driver will typically pick you up with a full tank of fuel and you pay at the end. Large Toyota Hi-Ace, Nissan Urvan and newer Toyota Commuter minivans go for around 2,000 baht per day plus fuel. Most hotels and some guest houses can arrange it for you, in addition to vehicle rental outlets and the many travel agencies in town.
The quintessential image of Chiang Mai with its large gold-plated <i>chedi</i>, visible from the city on a clear day, <b>Wat Phrathat Doi Suthep</b> (à¸§à¸±à¸à¸à¸£à¸°à¸à¸²à¸à¸¸à¸à¸­à¸¢à¸ªà¸¸à¹à¸à¸, Huai Kaeo Rd, 30 baht, <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.doisuthep.com/index.php?lang=en">[16]</a>) is 18&#160;km from town, sitting at a 1,073&#160;m elevation on the slopes of Doi (Mount) Suthep. Built in 1383 during the Lanna Thai period, legend has it that the temples site was selected by an elephant sent to roam the mountain side, where upon reaching a suitable spot, it trumpeted, circled three times, knelt down and promptly died, which was interpreted as a sign indicating an auspicious site. The temple offers grand views over the city, but no reward is without effort as you must ascend the 300-plus steps of the Naga-lined stairs. The climb may be a strain in the high altitude's thin air for the less fit, so you may opt to take the cable car for 20 baht.  For the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://chiangmaibest.com/thai-holidays-festivals/visaka-bucha/">Visaka Bucha holiday</a> in June or July each year, it is traditional for people to walk from the zoo to the temple and vast numbers make the pilgrimage to the top, which takes around 4-5 hours.
In the vicinity there are several other attractions you may want to consider visiting. The Bhuping Royal Palace Gardens are 4 km further along the road from Wat Prathat, with a reasonably easy walk along the meter-wide road shoulder. Or you can get a shared songthaew from Wat Prathat for 30 baht, but you may have to wait until it fills up. Further along the road is a hill tribe village, and although tourist-oriented, is really worth the trip. There are many shops for local handicrafts, etc. These are the people from the far north of the country, many originally from Myanmar. There are two areas in the village that require entrance fee: 10 baht to enter a flower garden (where women can take pictures using traditional clothes) and a hill tribe opium museum (the museum is in a very poor condition); and 10 baht to enter the hill tribe waterfall (man-made).
<b>Getting there</b> is a source of much consternation to many travellers. Clearly marked songthaews leave from Pratu Chang Phuak. Prices are fixed at 50 baht up and 50 baht down; but the drivers wait until they have sufficient (up to 8) passengers before they depart, potentially making for a lengthy wait. Most guidebooks advise taking a songthaew from Mani Nopharat Rd, resulting in the drivers milking the tourist cash-cow and raising their price from a reasonable 50 baht to a ludicrous 500 baht.
Another option is to take a songthaew from your hotel to Chiang Mai Zoo for 20 baht (if you are close to the city walls), where there will be several songthaews waiting on Huai Kaeo Rd to get a full load of passengers for a trip up the mountain. They seem to congregate around the Chiang Mai Zoo, so if you just say "zoo" to the driver he will know what you're talking about. From the zoo prices range from 40 baht for a one-way trip to Wat Prathat to 180 baht for a full round-trip tour, including the temple, Bhuping Palace Gardens, and the the hill tribe village, with an hour at each location, but you may have to wait until there are sufficient people who want the same tour or be prepared to pay more. You can also get between many of these by buying point-to-point tickets at the time you want them, or walking some segment. Any songthaew up the mountain road may be a trial for those prone to motion-sickness, so take appropriate precautions.
There are several little annoying charges to pay for foreigners. To enter the Doi Suthep itself is free for Thais, and 30 baht for foreigners. Tour operators will ask 700 baht for a tour.
The journey from town can be made by motorcycle or a bicycle with appropriate gearing. The final 12 km from the zoo onwards is entirely uphill and will take 60-90 minutes if cycling.
There are more than 300 temples in Chiang Mai and its outskirts, with a dozen stand-outs of historical or architectural significance within walking distance of each other. Buddhist temples in Chiang Mai exhibit a mixture of Lanna Thai, Burmese, Sri Lankan and Mon architectural styles that reflect the varied heritage of Northern Thailand.
Though certain temples on the conventional tourist circuit can be overrun with loud groups it is not hard to find many less well-known, but no less interesting, temples quietly and gently crumbling in the absence of tourist hordes. Whichever you visit, keep in mind that the temples are sacred religious places of deep cultural significance for the locals. Show respect by wearing appropriate attire (long pants for men, modest tops and skirts for women, no bare shoulders or plunging necklines and women must wear a bra). You must take off your shoes before entering the temple or other buildings, but they may be worn in the courtyard. <b>Taking photographs</b> of Buddha images is no problem, but it is polite to ask before taking pictures of monks or locals. All temples are free.
There are many art galleries and exhibitions in Chiang Mai, featuring contemporary artwork of both local Thai and Myanmar artists.
It is extremely important to well research your elephant tour. Some tours offer twice the service as others and at the same price. Expect private time with elephants, bathing elephants in a river and feeding them, free lunch, transport to and from your hotel, an elephant ride through the jungle and a small training course on some basic commands. Most tour operators also offer rafting as well at the end of the experience.
While a source of great amusement, be sure to choose your tour responsibly. Some have reported elephants in distress and what looked like painful, horrible conditions for the animals. Ask other tourists and check online before choosing. It is important to understand that elephants are considered livestock under Thai law, and as such owners can treat them in any way they please. This often includes beating, stabbing, or blinding them, as well as putting them through the ritual "phajaan," which intends to break the spirit of the elephant. Elephants generally will not accept riders on the trekking seat unless they have undergone the phajaan. It is encouraged that visitors do their own research to draw their own conclusions. A good, although not foolproof, sign for spotting elephant mistreatment is holes in or pieces missing from the ear.
After football, Thai boxing is the national sport of Thailand. It can be seen in three different stadiums:
Chiang Mai, Thailand âsecond cityâ and the âRose of the Northâ may well be one of Southeast Asiaâs most livable cities and the ideal spot to spend some quality time in a spa, health resort, or wellness center. It is more manageable than Bangkok, yet is home to a wide variety of health centers, not to mention parks, golf courses, mountains, and fantastic trekking.
Visitors are spoilt for choice between modest retreats, boutique hotels, or full-blown wellness centers. Should your needs be more surgical, Chiang Mai has a number of top drawer medical facilities, including the highly rated, JCI-accredited Chiang Mai Ram hospital. <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.thailandmedtourism.com/FileUpload/MultimediaFile/130909045642638.pdf">[32]</a> A number of fine spa and massage establishments are located in the heart of Chiang Mai, probably within 15 minutes or so of your hotel, and include the following:
Raft trips down the Mae Tang River are offered by organised by several companies and can often be combined with elephant riding or mountain biking. During the dry season (Jan-Feb) water levels are relatively low with only grade 2-3 rapids, but during the rainy season (Jun-Oct) higher water levels make for a more exciting grade 4-5 trip.
Chiang Mai swimming pools open to the public vary in quality, cleanliness and accessibility. On balance, those pools which are operated to internationally recognised standards of water quality are those which are privately owned by foreign investors.
Chiang Mai is a great place to shop. Sprawling markets during the day and night carry items from cheap trinkets to skilfully made local craft. ATM's can be found all around, but all charge 150 baht to foreign cards, except for Aeon. The most conveniently located Aeon ATMs can be found at Central Airport Plaza Chiang Mai (southwest of Old Town) on the 3rd floor, and at Tesco Lotus north of Old Town at the superhighway (at the corner with Atsadathon Rd), ground floor.
Modern shopping malls sell all the usual big brand products; worth investigating for electronic goods as prices can be negotiated down to a bargain.
Along Rt 1006 (Charoen Muang Rd) just past the superhighway (Rt 11) are various factories offering tours of their manufacturing process and showrooms. Silverware, silk, furniture and brass items generally priced with the cashed up tourist in mind, but the tours might be worth a look to see how things are made. They are generally open during normal daytime hours.
Chiang Mai's restaurants offer a wide range of food, second only to Bangkok. Naturally it's a good place to sample northern Thai food: in particular, hunt down some <i>khao soi</i>, yellow wheat noodles in curry broth,  traditionally served with chicken (<i>kai</i>) or beef (<i>neua</i>), but available some places as vegetarian or with seafood - see listings below. Another local specialty is <i>hang ley</i>, Lanna-style pork curry.  There is also a wide range of excellent international food restaurants, from cheap hamburger stands to elaborate Italian eateries.
When you come to Chiang Mai you should try a <i>khantoke</i> dinner and show. Although these are just for tourists it is still a nice way to spend an evening. The first khantoke dinner was held in 1953 by Professor Kraisi Nimanhemin who wanted to host a special event for 2 friends leaving Chiang Mai. Two more such dinners were held, both in 1953, thus "khantoke" dinners are not "historic",  but rather a relatively recent invention. Khantoke literally means <i>small bowl, low table</i> (khan = small bowl. tok = low table) There are also many garden restaurants where you can enjoy an excellent Thai meal in a beautiful setting.
The range and value of Western food in Chiang Mai is unsurpassed in Northern Thailand and there is a full range of restaurants from Australian/British/Irish, through French and German to Italian, Spanish, American and Mexican. In fact considering how remote Chiang Mai is from the major centres of population in Asia, it is remarkable how many Western restaurants there are! This is one city where eating Thai is not the only option.
Transient groups of roadside stalls set up in the evening selling basic, but good Thai food that may well be the most authentic you will find.
Chiang Mai has an amazing selection of vegetarian restaurants. The <i>Chiang Mai Vegetarian restaurants map</i> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="https://www.facebook.com/chiangmaivegetarian2006">[89]</a> lists over 50 places. Many other places will offer vegetarian food as well, but be aware that they often don't care if there are some animal ingredients in the food any way (i.e. shrimp paste, fish and oyster sauce). This is only part out of ignorance because even the local Buddhist monks themselves often eat fish. (Thus, asking for your dish to be prepared "like the monks", which works in other places, does not get the same results in Chiang Mai).
(See note about tap water under "Stay Safe" below)
Chiang Mai's nightlife scene is the most happening in the North, although still a far cry from Bangkok's hot spots. This guide will show where you can hangout, meet some of the most beautiful girls in Thailand, get outrageous or do whatever takes your fancy. There are discos, karaoke bars, and live music everywhere. The busiest nightlife zones are near <b>Tha Phae Gate</b>, <b>Loi Kroh Road</b> and along <b>Charoenrat Road</b> on the eastern bank of the Ping River.
Many, but by no means all, of Chiang Mai's tourist-oriented bars and pubs are located along <b>Loi Kroh Road</b>. In addition to the street bars, the <b>Chiang Mai Entertainment Complex (CMEC)</b> can be found at the Night Bazaar end of Loi Kroh. Here you will find around 30 bars ranging from sports bars that feature big screens to watch sports and play pool, to Pattaya-style girlie "beer bars", to even bars staffed exclusively by kathoeys (ladyboys). The complex also features a muay Thai boxing ring that has exhibition bouts for free or a voluntary donation, and on Thursdays real competitive boxing that requires a small entrance fee unless your bar has provided you with complimentary viewing. And for extra fun, the occasional Westerner tries his hands, feet, and elbows, usually with hilarious results.
Also take a stroll along <b>Moon Muang Road</b> and its side sois. Here you can find small expat hangouts, go-go bars, and sports bars. Most have pool tables and hostesses, along with music videos or various TV sport programmes. Be aware that despite their charm and friendliness, the pressure to purchase lady drinks can end up with a very surprising "check bin" (tab) at the end of the night. A few of these bars recommended by expats are:
There are also some regular bars with a <i>normal</i> atmosphere:
West of the city centre,  the area around <b>Nimmanhaemin Rd</b> is a popular hangout for younger Thais, perhaps due to its proximity to Chiang Mai University. The pubs tend to straddle a fine line between bar, restaurant, and nightclub, and feature loud music interspersed with live bands fronted by musicians who are most likely hitting the books in the daytime. Tourists looking for something racier are better off staying in the east side of town. Little English is spoken in this part of town. Little doesn't mean none, however, and the staff of many bars, being students, still can understand what do you want, or even sometimes can speak reasonably well.
Many smaller (usually no live music, but offer TV, generally with football or other sports) roadside Thai bars around this area, but outside of more up-market Nimmanhaemin Rd, they are cheap (50 to 65 baht for a large Chang or Leo is common). Often they have a discount if you buy 3 bottles of their proffered beer at one go, with a price of 129, 119, or even 109 baht for all three. The posters about those "promotions", if any, are in Thai language only. If you can't read Thai, look for the numbers mentioned above, and, if in doubt, ask the staff. Often (if they can speak enough English) the staff will tell you about this offer themselves, if they have one. Expats sometimes can be seen in those small bars, but generally most of the customers are Thais.
The area along the east bank of the Mae Ping River on Charoenrat Rd is famous for jazz, rock, pop, Thai, and country and western live music, along with restaurants serving Thai, Western, and Chinese food. Coming from the centre of the city, just walk from the night bazaar across the Narawatt Bridge, from where all the restaurants can be seen along the river on the left.
Most bands in Chiang Mai play for about an hour, and then move on to do the same at another restaurant or pub, so don't be surprised to see the same band twice if you switch venues.
Chiang Mai is a popular destination for gay tourists and many gay people have retired here. Highlights of the vibrant gay scene include:
Chiang Mai has sprouted a thriving coffee culture, having an abundance of roadside stalls to Starbucks-style chains seemingly every few metres. The dilettante baristas consistently squeeze out a decent cup from their electric machines regardless of the price or opulence of their premises. A standard espresso or long black (Americano) is 30 baht, iced around 35 baht and upwards of 45 baht for more elaborate milk and sprinkles.
Accommodation in Chiang Mai is generally cheap, even by Thai standards. All types of lodging are available from inexpensive guesthouses with little or no service to the typical high rise hotels and elaborate garden resorts. The latest boom is Thai-style boutique resorts located near the old city centre. Several have been built since mid-2005. They offer excellent service in quiet garden settings. Most are fairly small with as few as 8 rooms and a pool, and are decorated with Thai crafts and antiques.
Some of the cheapest accommodation may refuse guests who are not also booking a trekking package. If so, please remove them from Wikitravel.
Evenings in Chiang Mai are cooler than Bangkok and the south during the dry season, so air conditioning may be less of a priority.
For long-term (more than 1 month) visitors, simple but comfortable studio rooms (20-30 sq.m. with air-con, TV, fridge, outside window, parking, often WiFi [charged separately]) should cost 4,000 to 6,000 baht/month, plus utilities. Many of the best value places are located in the northwest (between Huay Kaew and Chang Phueak Rds, especially behind the superhighway) of the city and around Chiang Mai University (including the highway west of the airport), but there are some in other parts of the city as well. Some may offer daily rates (400-600 baht). Pay attention to the price of electricity when comparing. While the official price is just over 3 baht/kWh, almost all apartments/condos charge 5 to 10 baht, typically 6. More luxurious rooms and apartments are also available, for the price, and are more likely to be found online,
Chiang Mai invariably finds itself at the top of travel magazinesâ international surveys, and is no longer the sleepy northern Thai village it was a few decades ago. Although the city still retains its cultural charm, it has developed into a modern, fully-developed destination in its own right, complete with many excellent hospitals and treatment facilities, resorts, spas, wellness centers, alternative healing retreats with a distinctively northern Thai flavor.
Medical tourists are increasingly choosing Chiang Mai as their destination of choice for all types of procedures and treatments, including medical, dental, and cosmetic procedures. Aside from the pre- and post-treatment tourism options, the costs are generally lower, the weather is milder, and the overall stress factor is ratcheted down a few notches, perfect for rest and recovery.
Chiang Mai hospitals, aware of the increasing numbers of medical tourists heading north, have geared up to meet the challenge. Many offer special medical tourism packages for international patients and have upgraded their staff and facilities to handle the needs of visitors from different countries. At the forefront of this trend is Chiang Mai Ram International Hospital.
Chiang Mai Ram is the top choice for medical tourists, as it can handle the most complex procedures such as cardiac care, knee replacement, sexual reassignment surgery, and other very specialized medical treatments. It is also well-known for its cosmetic and dermatology departments. Its quality and standards have been recognized internationally, and it is JCI accredited.
In addition to popular dental treatments such as teeth cleaning and whitening, root canals, crowns, and implants, Chiang Mai now has a number of superb dermatology centers and skin-care clinics that specialize in treatments including facial-rejuvenation and hair and cellulite removal. Although Chiang Mai Ram is the northâs flagship hospital, there are a number of other long-established, well-regarded hospitals in Chiang Mai; these include: Chang Puak Hospital, McCormick Hospital, St. Peter Eye Hospital, Lanna Hospital, and Rajavej Chiang Mai Hospital. <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.mymedholiday.com/country/thailand/chiang-mai">[143]</a>
Chiang Mai is also an excellent dental tourism destination. In fact, many visitors prefer Chiang Mai over Bangkok for a number of reasons, especially for more serious, multi-visit procedures. Chiang Mai offers virtually everything that Bangkok has, but the prices for both the treatment and the cost of living in Chiang Mai is less.
There are laundromats and laundry services all over town, but they all wash cold. There is a laundromat that has 3 machines that can do hot washing as well on Chaiyapum Rd (road along the moat from Si Phum corner to Tha Phae Gate) about half way between Sompet market and Tha Phae Gate. Opposite there is a cafe from where you can watch your stuff while having a beer.
Chiang Mai, like most of Thailand, is quite safe, even at night. The dark streets can look foreboding, but crime is rare and visitors shouldn't worry unduly. As always, travellers should take extra care in all poorly lit or more remote areas. Don't carry valuables in a bag after dark as the most common tourist-related crime here is bag-snatching by youths on motorbikes. Mind your bag especially if you are walking on a dark street at night.
The safest approach is to act like your Thai hosts and wear reasonable clothing (shoulders and chest covered), medium-length skirts, long shorts or long pants, speak in a moderate tone of voice, and avoid flashing money or jewellery. Not only will respectable Thais appreciate your behaviour, you are much less likely to become a target of criminal activity.
Warning - Motorbike bag snatching -  travelers should watch out for bag snatchers riding on motorbikes especially in the run up to Songkran in early April. Do not carry bags or daypacks when walking at night. If you must carry a bag, do not wear the strap slung across your body as this will not deter them and can lead to serious injury if they attempt to take your bag when driving past at speed.
You will not read about this in travel guides, and it is not reported in local newspapers. According to the orthapedic surgeon in Chiang Mai Ram hospital , he treats victims of such attacks on a weekly basis with some suffering serious injuries from being dragged down the street when they couldn't or wouldn't let go of their bags. Others were injured by knives when the snatchers attempted to slash the bag straps while driving past. Just google "bag snatch" and "motorbike"
Unfortunately some scams from <a href="/en/Bangkok" title="Bangkok">Bangkok</a> have started to rear their ugly heads in Chiang Mai. Two in particular are worth watching out for: the <b>gem scam</b>, where you are talked into buying near-worthless gems at far above their real value; and the <b>tuk-tuk scam</b>, where a smooth-talking tuk-tuk driver tells you that the attraction you want to see is closed, and instead offers you a sightseeing tour for 20 baht (or some similarly unrealistic number). Needless to say, the tour will either consist of nothing but overpriced gift shops, or will smoothly segue into the gem scam. See the "Stay Safe" section of the <a href="/en/Bangkok" title="Bangkok">Bangkok</a> article for more details.
Chiang Mai's smoke levels can be discomfiting, and sometimes dangerous, during rice field-burning season, approximately February through April, or until it starts to rain a few times. The whole of northern Thailand often falls under a thick pall in this period, with hundreds of thousands treated for smoke inhalation. There are typically dozens of deaths. For example in 2007, 58 people died of smoke-related heart attacks. If you intend to visit at this time, you are well-advised to check on smoke levels in advance. Thousands of residents (foreign and Thai) leave Chiang Mai at this time to escape the smoke. The government is apparently uninterested in fixing the problem: in 2007, famously blaming it on Korean barbecue restaurants, which were then all closed down! Presently, the 'solution' is to spray the streets with water to 'moisten the air'. There is no political will to tackle the burning of rice fields, which is the cause of the smoke. In March 2012, dangerous PM10 particles measured over 200 mcg per cubic metre of air in Chiang Mai, well above the 'unsafe' level of 120 mcg (the Thai government standard, which is more than twice the maximum level set by the <a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=World_Health_Organization&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="World Health Organization (page does not exist)">World Health Organization</a> ( <a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=WHO&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="WHO (page does not exist)">WHO</a> ) at 50 mcg). Neighbouring areas were as bad or worse (Chiang Rai for example was at 306 mcgs), so moving on to a neighbouring province will generally not help. The pall of smoke stretches from northern Laos, across Thailand, to eastern Burma.
Tap water should be regarded as non-potable.  Liquids from sealed bottles nearly always are, and should be used wherever possible. Nearly all restaurants use ice made by professional ice-making companies and is generally safe. There are street side water vending machines (1 baht per litre) throughout the city. Using one saves money and a lot of plastic refuse.

Many guest houses, hotels, cafes, shopping malls, and even swimming pools, offer Wi-Fi connections.  These are usually free or available for a small charge. If you are travelling with your laptop you should be able to connect to the Internet within a 500 m radius of your Chiang Mai city-based accommodation at little or no cost.
In November 2012, the Ministry of Information announced the launching of 3,000 free Wi-Fi hotspots in Chiang Mai. The program, called <b>ICT Free Wi-Fi for the Public by AIS</b>, offers a download speed of 10 Mbps for up to five hours a month. Hotspots can be found near schools, shopping centres, hospitals, and government offices. Those interested must sign up for the free service at <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.ais.co.th/ictfreewifi">[145]</a>, after which you will receive a user ID and password.
Internet cafes abound and can be found everywhere within the city. Prices vary from 10 baht/hour (in "gaming" places filled with local kids) to 60 baht/half-hour (2 baht/minute) and up. Most places charge per 15 or 30 minute block, others by the minute. The cheapest and most comfortable places with fast connections, webcam, microphone and Skype, can be found along Huay Kaew Road near the main entrance to Chiang Mai University, where the cost is 10-20 baht.
As everywhere in Thailand, GPRS/EDGE is a cheap and convenient option to access Internet if you have a laptop and local SIM card. TrueMove 850 MHz 3G covers most parts of the city. For more details, refer to the <a href="/en/Thailand#Contact" title="Thailand">Thailand</a> article.
