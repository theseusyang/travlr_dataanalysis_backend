<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.nycvisit.com/"><b>New York City</b></a> (also referred to as "New York", "NYC", "The Big Apple", or just "The City" by locals), is the most populous city in the <a href="/en/United_States" title="United States" class="mw-redirect">United States</a>. It lies at the mouth of the Hudson River in the southernmost part of the state, which is part of the <a href="/en/Mid-Atlantic" title="Mid-Atlantic">Mid-Atlantic</a> region of the U.S. The city spans a land area of 305 square miles (790&#160;kmÂ²).
New York City has a population of approximately 8.2 million people.

New York City is a center for media, culture, food, fashion, art, research, finance, and trade. It has one of the largest and most famous skylines on earth, dominated by the iconic Empire State Building.
New York City consists of five <b>boroughs</b>, which are five separate counties. Each borough has a unique culture and could be a large city in its own right. Within each borough individual <b>neighborhoods</b>, some several square miles in size, and others only a few blocks in size, have personalities lauded in music and film. Where you live, work, and play in New York says something to New Yorkers about who you are.
The five New York boroughs are:
New York City is one of the global centers of international finance, politics, communications, film, music, fashion, and culture, and is among the world's most important and influential cities. It is home to many world-class museums, art galleries, and theaters. Many of the world's largest corporations have their headquarters here. The headquarters of the United Nations is in New York and most countries have a consulate here.  This city's influence on the globe, and all its inhabitants, is hard to overstate, as decisions made within its boundaries often have impacts and ramifications across the world.
Immigrants (and their descendants) from over 180 countries live here, making it one of the most cosmopolitan cities in the world. Travelers are attracted to New York City for its culture, energy and cosmopolitanism. English is the primary language spoken by most New Yorkers although in many communities it is common to hear other languages that are generally widely understood. In many neighborhoods, there is a large Latino/Hispanic population, and many New Yorkers speak Spanish. Most cab drivers speak either Arabic, Hindi or Bengali. There are also many neighborhoods throughout the city that have a high concentration of Chinese immigrants where Mandarin or Cantonese may be useful. In some of these neighborhoods, some locals may not speak very good English, but store owners and those who would deal frequently with tourists or visitors all will speak English.
At the center of New York City is the borough of Manhattan, a long, narrow island nestled in a natural harbor. It is separated from The Bronx on the north east by the Harlem River (actually a tidal strait); from Queens and Brooklyn to the east and south by the East River (also a tidal strait); and from the State of New Jersey to the west and north by the Hudson River. Staten Island lies to the south west, across Upper New York Bay.
In Manhattan, the terms âuptownâ and ânorthâ mean northeast,  while âdowntownâ and âsouthâ mean to the southwest. To avoid confusion, simply use âuptownâ and âdowntown.â Street numbers continue from Manhattan into the Bronx, and the street numbers rise as one moves farther north (however, in the Bronx, there is no simple numerical grid, so there may be 7 blocks between 167 St. and 170 St., for example). Avenues run north and south. In Brooklyn the opposite is true, as street numbers rise as one moves south. Queens streets are laid out in a perpendicular grid - street numbers rise as one moves toward the east, and avenues run east and west. Staten Island has no street numbers at all.
The term âthe cityâ may refer either to New York City as a whole, or to the borough of Manhattan alone, depending on the context. The other boroughs, which are Brooklyn, The Bronx, Staten Island, and Queens, are sometimes referred to as âthe outer boroughs.â
New York City has a humid continental climate and experiences all four seasons, with hot and humid summers (Jun-Sept), cool and dry autumns (Sep-Dec), cold winters (Dec-Mar), and wet springs (Mar-Jun). Average highs for January are around 38Â°F (3Â°C) and average highs for July are about 84Â°F (29Â°C). However, temperatures in the winter can go down to as low as 0Â°F (-18Â°C) and in the summer, temperatures can go as high as 100Â°F (38Â°C) or slightly higher. The temperature in any season is quite variable and it is not unusual to have a sunny 60Â°F (16Â°C) day in January followed by a snowy 25Â°F (-3Â°C) day. New York can also be prone to snowstorms and nor'easters (large storms similar to a tropical storm), which can dump as much as 2 feet (60&#160;cm) of snow in 24-48 hours. However snow rarely lies more than a few days. Tropical storms can also hit New York City in the summer and early fall.
The diverse population runs the gamut from some of America's wealthiest celebrities and socialites to homeless people. There are hundreds of thousands of immigrants in the city. New York's population has been diverse since the city's founding by the Dutch.  Successive waves of immigration from virtually every nation in the world make New York a giant social experiment in cross-cultural harmony.
The city's ethnic heritage illuminates different neighborhoods throughout the five boroughs. Manhattan's Chinatown remains a vibrant center of New York City's Chinese community, though in recent years the very large Chinese community in Flushing, Queens, has rivaled if not eclipsed it in importance, and three other Chinatowns have formed in New York City: the Brooklyn Chinatown in Sunset Park; the Elmhurst Chinatown in Queens; and the Avenue U Chinatown located in the Homecrest section of Brooklyn. Traces of the Lower East Side's once-thriving Jewish community still exist amid the newly-gentrified neighborhood's trendy restaurants and bars, but there are Chassidic communities in Borough Park, Crown Heights and Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Harlem has been gentrifying and diversifying and remains a center of African-American culture in New York. East (Spanish) Harlem still justifies its reputation as a large Hispanic neighborhood. Little known to most tourists are the large Dominican neighborhoods of Hamilton Heights and Washington Heights in upper Manhattan. Brooklyn's Greenpoint is famous for its large and vibrant Polish community, and the Flatbush section - once home to the Brooklyn Dodgers - is today a huge and thriving Caribbean and West Indian section. Queens and Brooklyn are known for being home to many of New York's more recent immigrant groups, which since 1990 have included large numbers of Russians, Uzbeks, Chinese, Irish, Italian, French, Filipinos, Yugoslavians, Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, Japanese, Koreans, Thais, Africans, Arabs (from throughout the Middle East and northern Africa), Mexicans, Dominicans, Ecuadorians, Brazilians, Colombians and Jamaicans.
New York City is home to 46 Fortune 500 companies. Its 2009 gross metropolitan product of $1.265 trillion was the largest of any American city and represented approximately 9% of the American economy. If it were a nation, the city would have the 16th-highest GDP in the world.
New York is the national center for several industries. It is the home of the three largest US stock exchanges (NYSE, NASDAQ, and AMEX) and many banks.
New York City (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IATA" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:IATA">IATA</a>: <b>NYC'</b>s the code for <a href="/en/Metropolitan_Area_Airport_Codes" title="Metropolitan Area Airport Codes">all airports</a>) is well connected by air with flights from almost every corner of the world. Three large airports, and several small ones, serve the region.
<b>John F. Kennedy International Airport</b> and <b>Newark Liberty International Airport</b> are large international airports, while <b>LaGuardia Airport</b> is a busy domestic airport. All three airports are run by the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.panynj.gov/">Port Authority of New York and New Jersey</a>.
<b>Teterboro Airport</b> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IATA" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:IATA">IATA</a>: <b>TEB</b>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICAO" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:ICAO">ICAO</a>: <b>KTEB</b>) is popular for general aviation and business jet travelers out of New York City. Air taxi and air charter companies such as <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.theearlyairway.com">The Early Air Way</a> and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.jscharter.com">Jetset Charter</a> fly a variety of private charter aircraft and jets, from charter luxury Gulfstream's down to economical piston twins for small groups and individuals.
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IATA" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:IATA">IATA</a>: <b>JFK</b>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICAO" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:ICAO">ICAO</a>: <b>KJFK</b>) is in the borough of Queens. There are 8 terminals that are not so close to each other (with 2 that is demolished and will be soon rebuilt), so it is important to note which terminal your flight leaves from. The free AirTrain connects the terminals. There is Wi-Fi (via Boingo) which may call it the worst Airport Wi-Fi coverage in America, however, Terminal 5 has Free Wifi.
Landing or taking off from JFK has been much improved in recent years by the addition of the muitl-billion-dollar Bay Runway, but due to sheer volume it remains the worst airport in the country in terms of flight delays. If possible, do not connect using JFK, especially when switching terminals. If you must connect via JFK, make sure you have sufficient time. For flights from domestic (US and Canada) to JFK to domestic, 2-3 hr. For domestic to JFK to international, 3-4 hr. For international to JFK to domestic, 3-5 hr. For international to JFK to international, 3-6 hr. International travelers are most strongly advised to avoid connecting in JFK to other international flights, as the security and immigration procedures for non-US citizens are monumentally time-consuming and tiresome. In addition, all Jetblue International flights and some Aer Lingus flights (except any flights from both airlines that  have done pre-clearance and Flights from Puerto Rico) are required to arrive at Terminal 4 not Terminal 5 since they don't have customs yet although it'll be built soon by 2015.
Left luggage services are available in the arrivals areas of Terminal 1 and Terminal 4 and cost $4-16 per bag per day, depending on size. There are plenty of ATMs, but almost all charge a $2-3 fee per withdrawal. Luggage trolleys are available either for a fee of $3 in Terminals 2, 3, 7, 8, 9 or free in Terminals 1 and 4. There are many hotels of all service levels close to the airport and most run shuttle buses to/from the airport.

+1 800-USA-RAIL (+1 800 872 7245) operates from <b>New York Penn Station</b>, directly under <b>Madison Square Garden,</b> on 34th St between 7th &amp; 8th Aves. Popular trains leaving during rush hours can fill up quickly; it's a good idea to make <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://reservations.amtrak.com">reservations on-line</a> or via phone and pick up your ticket using a credit card or your confirmation number at one of the electronic kiosks located throughout the station. On some of the non-business routes, for example New York to Montreal, Amtrak actually takes more time and costs more money than taking the bus or renting a car. Check and compare schedules and prices before booking.

New York City is served by three commuter railroads.  With the exception of the Metro-North Railroad (starts at Grand Central) the other commuter railroads also start at Penn Station by Madison Square Gardens.
<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.panynj.gov/path/index.html">PATH</a>(Port Authority Trans-Hudson) is a subway type system connecting New York City to <a href="/en/Hoboken" title="Hoboken">Hoboken</a>, <a href="/en/Newark_(New_Jersey)" title="Newark (New Jersey)">Newark</a>, and various points on the <a href="/en/New_Jersey" title="New Jersey">New Jersey</a> shore of the Hudson River. Two lines pass under the Hudson and enter the city, one terminating near the World Trade Center site downtown, the other at 33rd Street in midtown (see <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.panynj.gov/path/maps.html">map</a>). The PATH system is, therefore, a useful shortcut if travelling between Newark and downtown Manhattan, without having to travel all the way up to Penn Sation, and then double back southward again. The PATH station at 33rd Street is not connected to, nor part of Penn Station.
As of 1 Oct 2012, PATH train fares are $2.25 per trip. An RFID-type stored value card known as the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.panynj.gov/CommutingTravel/path/html/smartlink/"><i>Smartlink</i></a> affords PATH users discounts: $15 for 10 trips; $30 for 20 trips. However, the card itself must be purchased ($5, $20 including 10 trips). Fortunately, the PATH system accepts the Pay-Per-Ride MetroCard (but not <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.mta.info/metrocard/where_accept.htmUnlimited">Ride MetroCard</a>). <b>There's a $1 Fee for buying a new Metrocard except if expired or damaged.</b> For the visitor traveling from New Jersey daily, it is more convenient and possibly cheaper to purchase the MetroCard to travel on both the PATH and the MTA systems. However remember there is no free MetroCard transfer between PATH and MTA subways/buses.
Some buses offer Wi-Fi, power outlets and even  business-class style luxury. Buses serve New Jersey, New York suburbs west of the Hudson River, and all cities along the east coast of the US.
Additionally, be aware that with private buses in New York City "you get what you pay for." Most buses are safe, however, bus companies that are offering very low fares often are riskier in that their drivers are not as cautious on the roads and often speed. Also, the level of service is frequently somewhat less. If you have to transfer between buses using these discount buses for example, their drivers may speak limited English and be less able to assist you in making the transfer. Obviously there are exceptions to this, but it is a consideration of which travelers should be aware when choosing a bus company.
The NY Port Authority Bus Terminal at 625 8th Ave in Manhattan (8th Ave &amp; W 42nd St next to Times Square - '42nd St Port Authority Bus Terminal' subway stop) <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.panynj.gov/bus-terminals/port-authority-bus-terminal.html">[1]</a> serves as a central bus terminal for most major lines.  Note that not all lines go into the NY Port Authority bus Terminal either.  They can have stops (or their own office &amp; terminal) on the streets around Times Square, around Penn Station, Wall St, Chinatown, the airport(s), and/or anywhere in the city instead. Others may serve the Port Authority Terminal and then several other places around the city.  Check with them before departing.
The trip normally takes 4.5 hr, there are at least 82 buses daily in each direction.
Also see BoltBus, Greyhound, Megabus, and Peter Pan serving other locations.

New York City has always been one of the world's most important passenger sea ports, and arriving by ocean liner or cruise ship still remains an extraordinary and stylish method of arrival. In addition to passenger service from the Cunard Line, many cruise ships start or end their voyages in New York City.

<b>"Left luggage"</b><br />
Note that, due to security concerns, there are very few left luggage, storage lockers, or coatcheck services at <i>any</i> New York train station. This includes Penn Station and Grand Central Terminal; however the Amtrak checked luggage point at Penn Station is still operating, but only for ticketed passengers.
There are left luggage services in the Arrivals area of Terminals 1 and 4 at <b>JFK Airport</b>. The left luggage office in Terminal 4 is open 24 hours. There is also a luggage storage at Building 4 of JFK, which will require photo ID.
In Manhattan there is <b>Cubby</b>, with one location at 303 Park Avenue South - which is close to Grand Central Terminal; their prices are $7-$12 per 24 hour period. Also, there is <b>Schwartz Travel &amp; Storage</b>, with three locations in Midtown Manhattan, close to Penn Station; the price per day is $7-10 per bag.
Some hotels will store luggage for customers who have checked out of the hotel.
Most of Manhattan is laid out in a grid. By convention, Manhattan is spoken of as if it runs north to south (it's actually northeast to southwest), with streets running east and west and avenues running north and south. This makes it relatively easy and straightforward to find your way. Streets are numbered (except in downtown Manhattan) and the numbering rises as you go north. Most avenues are numbered from east to west (so First Ave is east of Second, etc.) below 59th St. Building numbering on avenues starts at the south end of the avenue and rises as you move north, while building numbering on streets starts at Fifth Ave (for the most part - see below) and increases as you go east or west crosstown.
Above Washington Sq, Fifth Ave divides Manhattan into east and west; numbering starts at Fifth Ave on each side (except where Central Park interrupts) and increases in either direction. Addresses west of Fifth Ave are written as, for example, 220 W 34th St, while those east of Fifth Ave are written as 220 E 34th St. However, for numbered streets below Washington Sq (fortunately, there are only two, 3rd and 4th streets), Broadway divides the streets into East and West. Because of this dual-numbering system, it is always advisable to keep in mind the closest intersection to your destination (6th Ave and 34th St, Broadway and 51st, etc.). You might also see addresses written in a kind of shorthand in terms of the nearest crossing streets, for example "1755 Broadway b/w 56th &amp; 57th" or "74 E. 4th b/w 2nd &amp; Bowery."  In Greenwich Village and downtown Manhattan - generally considered as below Houston ("HOW-ston") Street - all bets are off as streets meander, dead-end and intersect themselves. Streets in Greenwich Village are particularly notorious for defying logic. For instance, West 4th St intersects with West 10th St and West 12th St, and you can stand on the corner of Waverly Place and Waverly Place!
As a convenient guide to distance, there are 20 blocks per mile along the avenues (walking north/south). The average person can walk roughly 1 block per minute, or 60 blocks (3 miles) per hour. Walking east/west on the streets, blocks are generally much longer.
For shorter distances, there is no better way of getting around New York than hitting the sidewalk. If you use the subway or buses, you will almost certainly need to walk to and from stations or stops. In all areas of New York a traveler is likely to visit, all streets have wide, smoothly-paved sidewalks. For long distances, walking is also fine and a great way to see the city.
Jaywalking is extremely common among New Yorkers; an average New Yorker typically jaywalks 10-15 times a day. However, it can be extremely dangerous. If you cannot properly gauge the speed of oncoming cars, it is recommended you wait for the walk signal. Do not blindly follow someone crossing, as while they might have time to make it across, the person behind them might not. If you do jaywalk, remember that in the US, people drive on the right side of the road on two-way streets so remember to look left to check for oncoming traffic on your side of the road. Be aware that many streets are one-way, so you may have to look right. beware of bicyclists unlawfully going against the proper flow of vehicular traffic â or, for that matter, police or other vehicles doing the same.
Remember that even if you have a walk signal, police cars, fire trucks, and ambulances can bypass red traffic lights. Always defer to these vehicles when walking.
To ride the buses and subways in New York City, it's most likely you'll need a <b>MetroCard</b> from The Metropolitan Transit Authority or <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.mta.info/">MTA</a> for use on the New York City bus and subway systems. While it is possible to pay bus fares using exact change (coins only), you must have a MetroCard to enter the subway system. Cards can be bought online, at station booths, at vending machines in subway stations, and at <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://tripplanner.mta.info/metrocardmerchants/">many grocery stores and newstands</a> (look for a MetroCard sign on the store window). The vending machines in the stations accept credit cards; however, MetroCard vending machines will require that you type in your 5-digit zip code, or your regular PIN on international cards.  <b>THERE IS A $1 FEE FOR A NEW METROCARD</b> due to recent fare hikes.
The PATH (Port Authority Trans-Hudson) subway system, which operates between New York and New Jersey, is not operated by the MTA and is therefore separate but with the same fare as the MTA. In addition, if you buy a new Metrocard in any PATH Station <b>The $1 Fee also applies to all Metrocard Vending machines in all PATH Stations including station/commuter rail booths.</b> Even though PATH accepts payment by MetroCard, no free transfers are available to or from MTA subways or buses, because PATH is separate. JFK AirTrain also accepts MetroCard, but again, is not operated by the MTA and no free transfers are available.
Metro-North Commuter Railroad, Long Island Rail Road (LIRR), New Jersey Transit (NJT) Buses, Trains, and Light Rail systems, and Amtrak trains do <b>not</b> accept MetroCard.
Up to three children 44 inches tall and under ride for free on subways and local buses when accompanied by a fare paying adult.
MetroCards generally expire 1 year after purchase; the expiration date is printed on the back of the card at the upper left.
You can also get discounted tickets to certain events by showing your MetroCard when purchasing tickets. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.mta.info/metrocard/tourism/mc_promotions.htm">Current promotions,</a>
Despite a reputation for being dirty, the subway, which operates 24/7, is the fastest and best way to travel around the city. Fares are $2.50 (unless you use Single Ride MetroCard, which is $2.75), regardless of distance traveled. The much-feared subway crimes of the 1970s and 1980s are for the most part a thing of the past, and it is almost always completely safe. Just remember to use common sense when traveling late at night alone. Try to use heavily-traveled stations, remain visible to other people, and don't display items of value publicly. While violent crime is rare, petty crime - especially theft of iPhones and other expensive electronics - is very frequent, so be aware when using your phone on the train.
Every subway line is identified by either a letter or a number. In midtown Manhattan, they are mostly grouped by color, but not always.
<b>PATH</b> can be used to travel within Manhattan, from 33rd St along 6th Ave to Christopher St, and for less than the subway due to fare hike proposals from the MTA. It covers such a small territory but in theory you can use it if you have to travel its exact route.  Note that Unlimited Ride Metrocards cannot be used on the PATH. PATH also accepts the SmartLink Card (similar to the MetroCard, but the SmartLink Card cannot be used on the subway). Currently, the PATH fare is $2.50, Arround the same price as the New York City Subway, for now. The PATH train can be a great way to get around lower Midtown along 6th Ave. Like the subway, PATH operates 24/7. Usually, PATH trains arrive every 5-10 min (based on the time), but overnight, they may only come every 35 min.
Commuter rail lines are mostly used for traveling between the city and its suburbs; however, they can be used for intracity transit as well. A handful of destinations are closer to commuter rail stops but far from the subway. MetroCards are <i>not</i> accepted on commuter rail; separate single or period tickets <i>must</i> be bought. When purchasing commuter railroad tickets, it is advantageous to purchase them online or in railroad stations prior to boarding. While tickets are available for sale on trains, there is an on-board surcharge that makes them significantly more expensive.
The <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.mta.info/lirr/">Long Island Railroad</a>, often called the <b>LIRR</b> runs to/from Penn Station in Midtown Manhattan, Flatbush Avenue/Atlantic Avenue in Downtown Brooklyn, and has limited rush hour service to/from Long Island City, Queens. The Port Washington Branch goes to <a href="/en/Queens/Flushing-Northeast" title="Queens/Flushing-Northeast">Northeast Queens</a> which, aside from Flushing and Citi Field, is not served by the subway system. The Main Line, which contains most of the branches to the different parts of Long Island, goes to <a href="/en/Queens/Jamaica" title="Queens/Jamaica">Southeastern Queens</a>, including Jamaica, Laurelton, and Rosedale. The Atlantic Branch, which ends in <a href="/en/Brooklyn/Downtown" title="Brooklyn/Downtown">Downtown Brooklyn</a>, goes to <a href="/en/Brooklyn/East" title="Brooklyn/East">East New York</a> and <a href="/en/Brooklyn/Bedford-Stuyvesant_and_Flatbush" title="Brooklyn/Bedford-Stuyvesant and Flatbush">Bedford-Stuyvesant</a>, both in <a href="/en/Brooklyn" title="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a>. This branch is not accessible from Manhattan, however. The LIRR is also the fastest way to get from JFK to Manhattan, Brooklyn, or Queens, and also runs to many popular getaways in <a href="/en/Long_Island" title="Long Island">Long Island</a>, such as Long Beach, Port Jefferson, and Montauk. The LIRR has a somewhat deserved reputation for poor on-time performance, however this is more of a problem in the farther eastern reaches of the railroad and not so much a problem in New York City and its immediate suburbs.
The <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.mta.info/mnr/">Metro-North Railroad</a> provides services to/from Grand Central Terminal. Trains go to the Bronx and the northern suburbs of the city.  The Hudson Line covers several parts of the Western Bronx, while the Harlem Line goes through the Central Bronx â an area with no subway service. It is the best way to get to Arthur Avenue and the New York Botanic Gardens. The Hudson and Harlem Lines are also your gateway to <a href="/en/Westchester_County" title="Westchester County">Westchester County</a> and beyond, with the Hudson Line running all the way to <a href="/en/Poughkeepsie" title="Poughkeepsie">Poughkeepsie</a>. The New Haven Line runs to <a href="/en/Connecticut" title="Connecticut">Connecticut</a>, terminating, logically enough, in <a href="/en/New_Haven" title="New Haven">New Haven</a>.
Even in Manhattan, with its dense subway network, buses can often be the best way of making a cross-town (i.e. east-west) journey, for example, crossing Central Park to go from the Metropolitan Museum to the Museum of Natural History. And outside peak hours, a ride by bus from the tip of Manhattan at Battery Park to Midtown is a good and cheap way of taking in the sights.
In some areas, livery cabs can be flagged on the street. Though this is technically illegal (the driver, not you, could get into trouble), it is useful in upper Manhattan and the outer boroughs and is accepted practice. The minimum fare in these cabs is about $7, and it is advisable to negotiate the fare before you get inside (again, tipping your driver is expected). Since yellow cabs are hard to come by in the outer boroughs, these cars are particularly useful for getting to the airport (your hotel can arrange one, or look up car services in the Yellow Pages).
A word of advice about driving in New York City: <b>don't.</b> A car is inadvisable â street parking is practically non-existent near crowded areas and tourist attractions, and garage parking rates range from very expensive to plain extortion. Traffic is almost always congested, parking rules are confusing, and many drivers are aggressive - as you will find out, Manhattan reverberates to the near constant sound of car horns being blown.  The public transportation options are many and offer significant advantages and savings over driving a car. Many New Yorkers, particularly in Manhattan, don't own cars for this reason. If you are staying in a suburb and commuting to the city by car, think twice â driving to one of the Long Island Railroad, Metro North, or New Jersey Transit stations and taking the train into the city is a better option, and the parking fees at the station, train fare, and MetroCard combined are usually much cheaper than parking downtown. There are often secure parking areas in many stations. In Staten Island, parking near the ferry terminal and using the ferry will save you money and time.
If you do choose to drive, get a map, especially if driving outside of Manhattan. Good maps to use, if you are not driving, are the free bus maps which have each street, though the subway map can work in a pinch (also used for small boat navigation). In Queens, numbers identify not only avenues and streets, but also roads, places, crescents, and lanes, all of which might be near each other. Read the entire street sign. Outer borough highways are confusing and often narrowed to one lane, the potholes could trap an elephant, the signs are sometimes misleading, exits which should appear do not, and signs directing a highway approach drag you through miles of colorful neighborhood (in the wrong direction) before finally letting you onto the highway with a stop sign and six inches of merge space.
Traffic in New York City roughly follows a hierarchy of precedence, which is unwise to challenge. Fire engines, ambulances, and police cruisers are given priority, followed by other public service vehicles such as buses, road crews, and sanitation trucks. Beneath them are taxi cabs and delivery trucks. Below <i>those</i> are other cars. Note also that driving a car with out-of-state license plates (save for perhaps Connecticut or New Jersey) will instantly mark you as an outsider, sometimes resulting in other drivers being more aggressive around you than they would with a local. Suffice it to say, driving in New York is not for the timid, fearful, or otherwise emotionally fragile.
The major car rental agencies have offices throughout the city. Smaller agencies are also well represented. Be warned that car rentals in New York are generally more expensive than elsewhere in the United States, and frequently require a deposit of up to $500, if you do not have a credit card. Insurance rates also tend to be higher in New York than in most other cities.
Gas stations are few and far between, especially in Manhattan, where only a handful exist around the perimeter of the island. Be prepared to up to $0.50 more per gallon than in the surrounding suburbs or New Jersey. Therefore, if you have the option, it is best to fill your car while you aren't in NYC, as long as you have enough gas to last!
There are several points of entry/exit into the city from the New Jersey side: the Lincoln Tunnel (midtown/41st Street), the Holland Tunnel (downtown/Canal Street), and the George Washington Bridge (way uptown/178th Street) â all are accessible from the New Jersey Turnpike (I-95). I-78 east will also feed directly into the Holland Tunnel (US-1/9 is also a popular route). I-80 east will terminate at an I-95 junction, the north route of which will lead directly to the George Washington Bridge. The bridge is also directly accessible from US-46 east. With all of these options, many commuters choose to listen to 24 hour traffic reports on AM stations 880 (every ten minutes on the 8's) and 1010 (every ten minutes on the 1's) to find the least congested route at that time. Weekend traffic delays can easily exceed 60 minutes at some of the tunnels, so plan accordingly!
The Midtown Tunnel under the East River is convenient for Long Island travelers, as it becomes the Long Island Expressway.  The Queensborough Bridge (aka The 59th Street Bridge) also crosses the East River into Queens, is toll-free, and lands near the mouth of the Midtown Tunnel but requires some automotive manipulation to get onto the Long Island Expressway. Other routes head north and east out of the Bronx, including Interstates 87 (north to Albany) and 95 (northeast to Boston) and the Henry Hudson Parkway, which is along the Hudson River.
Toll charges are <b>Very Expensive</b> for some crossings mostly to New York from New Jersey and to Staten Island from New York. As of December 2, The Port Authority<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.panynj.gov/bridges-tunnels/tolls.html">[4]</a> had increase the tolls for New York/New Jersey crossings to a whopping $13, and it's cheaper if the toll is paid by E-ZPass. Eventually, it will increase until 2016 and there was some criticism for how that money was used. The MTA<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.mta.info/bandt/traffic/btmain.html">[5]</a> is more different. The Verrazano-Narrows Bridge cost $15, and most crossings cost $7.50 or less.  Be advised that there's is traffic delays as well and some will take a long time, mostly an hour.
On the other hand, many of the crossings (in particular all three Hudson River crossings) are only tolled going <i>into</i> New York City.
Traveling at off-hours makes sense to avoid rush hour traffic, but highways and roads are still generally packed any time of day. The Cross Bronx Expressway, which is part of I-95 and leads to the George Washington Bridge, is almost always choked with traffic. Expect traffic jams at 1-2am. The Long Island Expressway has heavy eastbound traffic between the morning and evening rushes. The Holland and Lincoln Tunnels are 10 minute waits on a good day. The Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (BQE) is notorious, and an accident on the Verazzano Bridge without shoulders can cause a backup all the way through the northern part of Staten Island into New Jersey. It is a good idea to check radio traffic reports, especially before crossing a bridge or tunnel. Three different stations have reports every 10 minutes around the clock: 880 AM (on the 8's), 1010 AM (on the 1's), and 1130 AM (on the 5's).
Driving cross-town (east-west) in Manhattan during rush hours is especially troublesome because the traffic lights are optimized to move traffic along the north-south roads. Your best bet is to avoid driving in Midtown Manhattan (between the 30s and 50s) whenever possible. If you do drive in Midtown Manhattan cross-town, posted Midtown Thru Streets <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://home2.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/motorist/streetprog.html">[6]</a> may reduce delays.
If you are traveling with a commercial vehicle, such as a moving truck, remember that commercial traffic is prohibited on many roadways throughout the city. Commercial traffic is permitted only on multiple-lane roadways designated as "expressways" (such as the Long Island Expressway, Cross-Bronx Expressway, or Brooklyn-Queens Expressway) and the surface streets unless marked otherwise. Commercial traffic is prohibited on all multiple-lane roadways designated as "parkways" (such as the Grand Central Parkway, Cross-Island Parkway, or Henry Hudson Parkway) with frequent low bridges. <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/motorist/commvehicle.shtml">[7]</a> Unfortunately, the majority of fast-moving roadways are designated as parkways in New York City. Commercial traffic is also prohibited on the Franklin Delano Roosevelt (FDR) Drive in Manhattan. The only viable option for traveling with a commercial vehicle in Manhattan is the surface streets, but always look out for low vertical clearance.
Parking in garages or outdoor lots is usually very expensive, costing as much as $40 per day in Manhattan, although cheap or free lot parking is available at some times at certain locations. Street parking can be free or much cheaper than garage or lot parking, but can be extremely hard to come by. Also, "bumping" cars in front of and behind of you to get into and out of a parking spot (known to some as "Braille Parking") is common, so if you choose to park on the street, don't be surprised if you find a few new scratches and scrapes on your bumper.
As a general rule, hotels in New York do not supply garage parking. The few that do will charge you handsomely for the privilege. To find garage parking, look at the following four websites:
Cycling <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/bikeped/bikemain.html">[21]</a> in Manhattan can often be quicker than taking the subway or a taxi, but it isn't for the fainthearted. New York City's tumultuous traffic makes biking difficult. Aggressive cab drivers, jaywalking pedestrians, potholes and debris on the roads create a cycling experience that might just as well have been taken from Dante's <i>Inferno</i>. If you do venture into the concrete jungle on a bike, make sure you wear a helmet and have sufficient experience in urban cycling. Despite the hazards, around 100,000 New Yorkers commute to work by bicycle every day. Conditions are likely to improve in future, as the city expands the cycle lane network and completes the traffic-free greenway encircling the whole of Manhattan.  Note that bicycles must remain on the street and are not allowed on sidewalks.
Like most of the great world cities, New York has an abundance of great attractions - so many, that it would be impossible to list them all here. What follows is but a sampling of the most high-profile attractions in New York City; more detailed info can be found in the district pages.
A number of multi-attraction schemes give reduced prices and line-skipping privileges.
<i>See also the district pages for detailed information about attractions. Detail is gradually being moved from this page to the district pages.</i>
<br />
Naturally, <a href="/en/Manhattan" title="Manhattan">Manhattan</a> possesses the lion's share of the landmarks that have saturated American popular culture. Starting in <a href="/en/Manhattan/Lower_Manhattan" title="Manhattan/Lower Manhattan">Lower Manhattan</a>, perhaps the most famous of these landmarks is easy to spot - the <b>Statue of Liberty</b>, a symbol of the nation standing atop a small island in the harbor, and perhaps also the most difficult attraction to access in terms of crowds and the long lines to see it. Nearby <b>Ellis Island</b> preserves the site where millions of immigrants completed their journey to America. Within Lower Manhattan itself, <b>Wall Street</b> acts as the heart of big business being the home of the <b>New York Stock Exchange</b>, although the narrow street also holds some historical attractions, namely <b>Federal Hall</b>, where George Washington was inaugurated as the first president of the United States. Nearby, the National September 11 Memorial at the <b>World Trade Center Site</b> commemorates the victims of that fateful day. Connecting Lower Manhattan to <a href="/en/Brooklyn/Downtown" title="Brooklyn/Downtown">Downtown Brooklyn</a>, the <b>Brooklyn Bridge</b> offers fantastic views of the Manhattan and Brooklyn skylines.
Moving north to <a href="/en/Manhattan/Midtown" title="Manhattan/Midtown">Midtown</a>, Manhattan's other major business district, you'll find some of New York's most famous landmarks. The <b>Empire State Building</b> looms over it all as the second-tallest building in the city, with the nearby <b>Chrysler Building</b> also dominating the landscape. Nearby is the headquarters of <b>United Nations</b> overlooking the East River and <b>Grand Central Terminal</b>, one of the busiest train stations in the world. Also nearby is the main branch of the <b>New York Public Library</b>, a beautiful building famous for its magnificent reading rooms and the lion statues outside the front door; and <b>Rockefeller Plaza</b>, home to NBC Studios, Radio City Music Hall, and (during the winter) the famous Christmas Tree and Skating Rink.
Still in the Midtown area but just to the west, in the <a href="/en/Manhattan/Theater_District" title="Manhattan/Theater District">Theater District</a>, is the tourist center of New York: <b>Times Square</b>, filled with bright, flashing video screens and LED signs running 24 hours a day.  Just to the north is <b><a href="/en/Manhattan/Central_Park" title="Manhattan/Central Park">Central Park</a></b>, with its lawns, trees and lakes popular for recreation and concerts.
New York has some of the finest museums in the world. All the public museums (notably including the Metropolitan Museum), which are run by the city, accept donations for an entrance fee, but private museums (especially the Museum of Modern Art) can be very expensive. In addition to the major museums, hundreds of small galleries are spread throughout the city, notably in neighborhoods like Chelsea and Williamsburg. Many galleries and museums in New York close on Mondays, so be sure to check hours before visiting. The following is just a list of highlights; see district pages for more listings.
New York City is home to some of the finest art museums in the country, and in <a href="/en/Manhattan" title="Manhattan">Manhattan</a>, you'll find the grandest of them all.  The <b>Metropolitan Museum of Art</b> in <a href="/en/Manhattan/Central_Park" title="Manhattan/Central Park">Central Park</a> has vast holdings that represent a series of collections, each of which ranks in its category among the finest in the world. Within this single building you'll find perhaps the world's finest collection of American artwork, period rooms, thousands of European paintings including Rembrandts and Vermeers, the greatest collection of Egyptian art outside Cairo, one of the world's finest Islamic art collections, Asian art, European sculpture, medieval and Renaissance art, antiquities from around the ancient world, and much, much more. As if all that wasn't enough, the Metropolitan also operates <b>The Cloisters</b>, located in Fort Tryon Park in <a href="/en/Manhattan/Harlem_and_Upper_Manhattan" title="Manhattan/Harlem and Upper Manhattan">Upper Manhattan</a>, houses a collection of medieval art and incorporates elements from five medieval French cloisters and other monastic sites in southern France in its renowned gardens.
Near the Metropolitan, in the <a href="/en/Manhattan/Upper_East_Side" title="Manhattan/Upper East Side">Upper East Side</a>, is the <b>Guggenheim Museum</b>. Although more famed for its architecture than the collection it hosts, the spiraling galleries are ideal for exhibiting art works. Also nearby is the <b>Whitney Museum of American Art</b>, with a collection of contemporary American art. In <a href="/en/Manhattan/Midtown" title="Manhattan/Midtown">Midtown</a>, the <b>Museum of Modern Art</b>(MoMA), holds the most comprehensive collection of modern art in the world, and is so large as to require multiple visits to see all of the works on display, which include Van Gogh's Starry Night and Picasso's Les Demoiselles dâAvignon, as well as an extensive industrial design collection. Midtown is also home to the <b>Paley Center for Media</b>, a museum dedicated to television and radio, including a massive database of old shows.
In <a href="/en/Brooklyn" title="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a>'s <a href="/en/Brooklyn/Prospect_Park" title="Brooklyn/Prospect Park">Prospect Park</a>, the <b>Brooklyn Museum of Art</b> is the city's second largest art museum with excellent collections of Egyptian art, Assyrian reliefs, 19th-century American art, and art from Africa and Oceania, among other things. <a href="/en/Queens/Long_Island_City" title="Queens/Long Island City">Long Island City</a> in <a href="/en/Queens" title="Queens">Queens</a> is home to a number of art museums, including the <b>PS1 Contemporary Art Center</b>, an affiliate of the Museum of Modern Art, and the <b>Museum of the Moving Image</b>, which showcases movies and the televisual arts.
In New York City, no museum holds a sway over children like the <b>American Museum of Natural History</b> in Manhattan's <a href="/en/Manhattan/Upper_West_Side" title="Manhattan/Upper West Side">Upper West Side</a>. Containing the Hayden Planetarium, incredible astronomy exhibits, animal dioramas, many rare and beautiful gems and mineral specimens, anthropology halls, and one of the largest collections of dinosaur skeletons in the world, this place offers plenty of stunning sights.
Near Times Square in the <a href="/en/Manhattan/Theater_District" title="Manhattan/Theater District">Theater District</a>, the <b>Intrepid Sea, Air &amp; Space Museum</b> takes up a pier on the Hudson River, with the aircraft carrier <i>Intrepid</i> docked here and holding some incredible air and space craft.
Over in the <a href="/en/Queens/Flushing-Northeast" title="Queens/Flushing-Northeast">Flushing</a> district of Queens, on the grounds of the former World's Fair, is the <b>New York Hall of Science</b>, which incorporates the Great Hall of the fair and now full of hands-on exhibits for kids to enjoy.
Another standout museum is the <b>Transit Museum</b> located in an abandoned station in <a href="/en/Brooklyn/Downtown" title="Brooklyn/Downtown">Downtown Brooklyn</a>.  The old subway cars are a real treat and the museum is <i>a must</i> if you're in New York with kids (and well-worth it even if you're not).
Like all great cities, New York is made up of distinct neighborhoods, each of which has its own flavor. Many of the neighborhoods are popular with visitors, and all are best experienced on foot. See individual borough pages (<a href="/en/Manhattan" title="Manhattan">Manhattan</a>, <a href="/en/Brooklyn" title="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a>, <a href="/en/Queens" title="Queens">Queens</a>, <a href="/en/Bronx" title="Bronx">Bronx</a> , and <a href="/en/Staten_Island" title="Staten Island">Staten Island</a>) for a comprehensive listing of neighborhoods.
Though the image many people have of Manhattan is endless skyscrapers and packed sidewalks, the city also boasts numerous lovely parks, ranging from small squares to the 850-acre <b>Central Park</b>, and there are worthwhile parks in every borough.  From the views of the New Jersey Palisades from <b>Fort Tryon Park</b> in Upper Manhattan, to the grand <b>Pelham Bay Park</b> in The Bronx, and the famous <b>Flushing Meadow Park</b> in Corona, Queens, site of the U.S. Open Tennis Tournament, there is more than enough to keep any visitor busy. And almost any park is a great spot to rest, read, or just relax and watch the people streaming past.  To find out more about New York City parks, look at the New York City Department of Parks &amp; Recreation website and the WikiTravel pages for each borough.
Note that except for special events, all NYC parks are closed 1AMâ6AM.
A general word of advice on sightseeing in New York:
Tourists often spend their entire vacation in New York standing in line (or as New Yorkers say, "standing on line"). This is often unnecessary; there are usually alternatives. For example, one can choose to avoid the Empire State Building during the day (it is open, and empty, late, until midnight or 02:00 on weekends during summer), skip the Statue of Liberty in favor of the Staten Island Ferry, and stay away from the Guggenheim on Monday (it is one of the only museums open that day). Also, there is no reason to stand in line for a Broadway show if you already have a ticket with an assigned seat. If you prefer, get a drink nearby and come back closer to curtain time, when you can walk right in. The lines for bus tours can be absurd because tourists all seem to have the exact same itinerary - which is get on a bus in the morning in Times Square, get off for the Statue of Liberty, and finish on the East Side in the afternoon. Why not go downtown in the morning, and save Midtown for the afternoon? You will thank yourself for avoiding the crowds. Also, understand that buses are the slowest way to go crosstown in Midtown Manhattan during peak hours, and taxis are not much better. You are often better off on foot.
<b>Theater and Performing Arts</b>
New York's Broadway is famous for its many shows, especially musicals. You might want to visit TKTS online<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.tdf.org/">[27]</a>, which offers tickets for shows the same night at discounted prices, usually 50% off or visit BroadwayBox.com,<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.broadwaybox.com">[28]</a> or NYTix.com,<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.nytix.com/Links/Broadway/listofcurrentshows.html">[29]</a> community sites posting all recent Broadway discounts. TKTS has two offices, one at Times Square with lines often hours long, and a much faster one (sometimes minutes) at South Street Seaport (Corner of John St, just south of Brooklyn Bridge). Note that only cash is accepted at South Street. Show up at opening time for best selection. Tickets to most Broadway shows are also available from the Broadway Concierge and Ticket Center<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.ilovenytheater.com/broadway_ticket_center.php">[30]</a>, inside the Times Square Visitor Center. They offer restaurant and hotel recommendations, parking help, and other services in addition to ticket sales, available in several languages.
New York boasts an enormous amount and variety of theatrical performances. These shows usually fall into one of three categories:  Broadway, Off-Broadway, or Off-Off-Broadway. <i>Broadway</i> refers to the shows near Times Square that usually play to theaters of 500 seats or more. These include the major musicals and big-name dramatic works, and are the most popular with visitors. Tickets for Broadway shows can run to $130 a seat, though discounters like TKTS (above) make cheaper seats available. <i>Off-Broadway</i> indicates performances that are smaller (less than 500 seats) and usually of a certain intellectual seriousness.  Some of these theatres are located around Times Square in addition to different locations throughout Manhattan. Tickets to Off-Broadway shows tend to range from $25â50. <i>Off-Off-Broadway</i> refers to those shows that play to very small audiences (less than 100 seats) with actors working without equity.  These can be dirt cheap and often very good, but some may be sufficiently avant-garde as to turn off conservative playgoers.  Off-Off-Broadway Theaters worth checking out are Rising Sun Performance Company <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.risingsunnyc.com">[31]</a>, Endtimes Productions <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.endtimesproductions.org/main.html">[32]</a>, and The People's Improv Theater <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.thepit-nyc.com/index.html">[33]</a>.
For current and upcoming Broadway and Off-Broadway info and listings, visit Playbill.com<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.playbill.com">[34]</a>. This site also has lots of articles on what's going on in the NY commercial theatre scene. Broadway.com <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.broadway.com">[35]</a> and Newyorkcitytheatre.com <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.newyorkcitytheatre.com">[36]</a> also has plenty of info, as well as some videos and photos. Theatermania <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.theatermania.com">[37]</a> has many discounts to the bigger shows, and also provides listings for the Off-Off scene. If visiting in the summer, brave the huge lines and attempt to get tickets to the Public Theater's <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.publictheater.org">[38]</a> annual "Shakespeare in the Park," which often features big-time stars of stage and screen. Meryl Streep, Kevin Kline, Natalie Portman, and Liev Schrieber are just a few of the actors to have appeared here in recent years. Oh, and it's free. Just get to one of the box offices ridiculously early, especially the one at the Park.
It's possible to purchase tickets to The Tony Awards, Broadway's biggest award ceremony and the culmination of the theatrical season in the city. These aren't cheap, but if you're into the theatre scene and know something about the various performers being honored, it can be an exciting night. In any case, the performances are always fun, and you can catch moments that aren't in the broadcast. Always the first or second Sunday night in June, visit The Tony Awards website <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.tonyawards.com">[39]</a> for the most current details.
New York has a wide variety of musical and dance companies, including several that are among the world's most renowned. There are also numerous small companies putting on more idiosyncratic shows every night of the week.  The following are just a few of New York's most high-profile music and dance options.
Subway: N, Q, or R to 57th Street-7th Avenue.
Subway: 1 to 66th Street-Lincoln Center
<b>Film</b>
New York is one of the world's greatest film cities, home to a huge number of theaters playing independent and repertory programs.  Many major US studio releases open earlier in New York than elsewhere (especially in the autumn) and can be found at the major cineplexes (AMC, United Artists, etc.) around the city.  Be advised that, as with everything else in New York, movies are quite popular, and even relatively obscure films at unappealing times of the day can still be sold out. It's best to get tickets in advance whenever possible.
As many films premiere in New York, you can often catch a moderated discussion with the director or cast after the show.  Sometimes even repertory films will have post-screening discussions or parties. Check listings for details.
In addition to the more than 15 commercial multiplexes located throughout the city, some of the more intriguing New York film options include:
Subway: N or R to Prince Street.
Subway: F to 2nd Avenue-Lower East Side
<b>Parades</b>
New York City hosts many parades, street festivals and outdoor pageants. The following are the most famous:
New York is the fashion capital of the United States, and is a major shopping destination for people around the world.  The city boasts an unmatched range of department stores, boutiques, and specialty shops. Some neighborhoods boast more shopping options than most other American cities and have become famous as consumer destinations. Anything you could possibly want to buy can be found in New York, including clothing, cameras, computers and accessories, music, musical instruments, electronic equipment, art supplies, sporting goods, and all kinds of foodstuffs and kitchen appliances.  See the <b>borough pages</b> and <b>district sub-pages</b> for listings of some of the more important stores and major business districts, of which there are several.
Anyone can freely create, display, and sell art, including paintings, prints, photographs, sculptures, DVDs, and CDs, based on freedom of speech rights. Thousands of artists earn their livings on NYC streets and in parks. Common places to find street artists selling their work are SoHo in Lower Manhattan and near the Metropolitan Museum of Art on 81st Street.
New York City has a number of retail outlet locations, offering substantial discounts and the opportunity to purchase ends-of-line and factory seconds. <b>Century 21</b> in <a href="/en/Manhattan" title="Manhattan">Manhattan</a> is one of the largest stores where New Yorkers get designer clothing for less.
Basic food, drinks, snacks, medicine, and toiletries can be found at decent prices at the ubiquitous <b>Duane Reade</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.duanereade.com/">[46]</a>, <b>CVS</b>, and <b>Rite Aid</b> stores. For a more authentically New York experience, stop by one of the thousands of bodegas/delis/groceries.  Although sometimes dirty-looking in apparent need of repair, you can purchase groceries, water, inexpensive flowers, coffee, and cooked food -- typically 24/7.
Most shops in NYC airports are chain outlets, the same as can be found in most of large airports in the world--so it's pretty difficult to feel the spirit of the fashion capital if you only have 2 hours waiting for a connecting flight. At JFK airport, JetBlue Airways' new terminal 5 is populated with modern, cutting-edge restaurants and shops, but terminals 4 and 8 are also a good place for retail and duty free shopping.
From Newark, the best shopping can be found in United Airlines' main hub in Terminal C which has a massive selection of restaurants and shops with the offering from Terminal B being pretty poor in comparison (although the Port Authority is making improvements as of 2012), and almost non-existent from the domestic Terminal A.
In New York City it is common for street vendors to set up tables on the sidewalk, close to the curb, and sell items. They are required to obtain a permit to perform this activity, but it is legal. Purchasing from these vendors is generally legitimate, although buying brand name goods from these vendors (particularly expensive clothing and movies) is ill advised as the products being sold may be cheap imitation products. It is considered safe to buy less expensive goods from these vendors, but most will not accept payment by credit card, so you will have to bring money. Be particularly wary of any street vendor that does not sell from a table (especially vendors who approach you with their merchandise in a briefcase) as these goods are almost certainly cheap imitation products.
New York has, as you might expect of the Big Apple, all the eating options covered and you can find almost every type of food available and every cuisine of the world represented. There are tens of thousands of restaurants to suit all tastes and budgets, ranging from dingy $0.99-a-slice pizza joints to $500-a-plate prix fixe sushi and exclusive Michelin-starred eateries. Thousands of delis, bodegas, and grocery stores dot every corner of the city and DIY meals are easy and cheap to find. Street food comes in various tastes, ranging from the ubiquitous New York hot dog vendors to the many carts with Middle Eastern cuisine on street corners in mid-town.  However in mid-town be wary of restaurants and bars both immediately on and around Times Square, or near the Empire State Building - many are tourist traps cashing in on travellers' gullibility and lack of local knowledge.  New Yorkers wouldn't dream of eating out in such places; you shouldn't either!  It pays to be adventurous therefore and reach out into the individual neighborhoods for a true authentic NYC dining experience!
Fruit stalls appear at many intersections from Spring to Fall with ready to eat strawberries, bananas, apples, etc available at very low cost. Vegetarians will find New York to be a paradise with hundreds of vegetarian-only restaurants and good veggie options in even the most expensive places.
Maybe it's the size of New Yorkers' tiny kitchens, or perhaps it's the enormous melting-pot immigrant populations, but either way, this city excels at every kind of restaurant. There are fancy famous-chef restaurants, all ethnic cuisines and fusion/updates of ethnic cuisines (second-generation immigrants tweaking their family tradition), plus all the fashionable spots, casual bistros, lounges for drinking and noshing and more.
While most restaurants accept credit cards, some smaller restaurants, particularly in Chinatown and Williamsburg, do not. Others have required minimum purchase amounts for credit/debit purchases. Most establishments will prominently display this requirement, so keep your eyes open if you typically pay for meals with plastic.
As in the rest of the United States, tipping is expected in New York restaurants. New Yorkers often calculate the base tip by doubling the tax. For more information, see <a href="/en/United_States_of_America#Tipping" title="United States of America">Tipping in the United States</a>.
Restaurants with entrees under $20 are unlikely to have any preference about what their customers wear. Of course, like most major cities, New York has some expensive, extremely fashionable restaurants that care about, and enforce, a certain level of dress among their customers - but "jackets only" restaurants are very uncommon nowadays.
If you're from elsewhere in the US and wish to "pass" as a local within Manhattan, pay attention to your shoes and coat. Most local exclusiveness is pretty understated, but where it exists it's generally from nightlife commuters from New Jersey and Long Island that supposedly threaten to rob bar-filled neighborhoods of their local color. Therefore, if your style doesn't fit in but is obviously from outside the US, you may find yourself as welcomed as graciously as any local, if not more so.
New York is a friendly place for vegetarians and vegans. There are many vegetarian only restaurants with offerings varying from macrobiotic food to Ayurvedic thalis or Asian Buddhist food. But, more importantly, almost every restaurant at every point on the price scale has vegetarian dishes that are more than an afterthought. Even <b>Per Se</b>, one of the most expensive and sought after restaurants in the city, has a seven course vegetarian tasting menu well worth the expense. DIY vegetarians will have no problem finding fresh vegetables, a wide variety of cheese, bread and prepared vegetarian foods in New York supermarkets.
Nothing differentiates New York more from other American cities than the astonishing amount of food cooked and served on the streets.  Starting with the thousands of hot dog stands on almost every street corner (try <i>Hallo Berlin</i> on 54th and Fifth for the best rated sausages), the possibilities are endless. People trek to Jackson Heights in Queens for a nibble of the famous arepas of the <i>Arepa Lady</i>. Freshly cooked Indian dosas are served up for a pittance at the <i>NY Dosas</i> stand in Washington Square Park. The Trinidadian/Pakistani <i>Trinipak</i> cart on 43rd and Sixth. Danny Meyer, the famous restaurateur, has a burger stand ("Shake Shack") in Madison Square Park as well as a new location on the upper west side. The halal offerings in midtown are legendary (<i>Kwik-Meal</i> on 45th and Sixth; <i>Chicken Guy/Halal Chicken</i> on 53rd and Sixth and many others). Most carts serve lunch (from about eleven in the morning to five or six in the evening) and disappear after dark, so look for a cart near you, smell what's cooking, and enjoy a hot and often tasty lunch for a few dollars (a meal costs anywhere from about $2 to $8). Mornings, from about 06:00-10:00, the streets are dotted with coffee carts that sell coffee, croissants, bagels, and danish pastries and are good for a cheap breakfast: small coffee and bagel for a dollar or so. From 10:00 to 19:00 many vendors sell lunch and dinner choices, including hot dogs, hamburgers, gyros, and halal. Other street vendors sell <i>italian ices</i>, <i>pretzels</i>, <i>ice cream</i>, and <i>roasted peanuts</i>. Also, look around for the coffee truck (often found in Union Square), dessert truck, as well as Belgian waffle truck that roam around the city.
New York's many markets and grocery stores make preparing your own food interesting and easy. Almost every grocery store, deli, or bodega has a prepared foods section where you can make your own salad (beware, you are charged by the pound!) or buy ready to eat foods such as burritos, tacos, curries and rice, lasagna, pastas, pre-prepared or freshly-made sandwiches, and many other types of foods. <i>Whole Foods</i> has five New York City locations, all with a variety of foods, and a clean place to sit and eat but any supermarket will have enough to take away to the park or your hotel room for a low cost meal. If you have a place to cook, you'll find almost any kind of food in New York though you may have to travel to the outer boroughs for ethnic ingredients. Most supermarkets have Thai, Chinese, and Indian sauces to add flavor to your pot, and many, especially in upper Manhattan, have the ingredients necessary for a Mexican or Central American meal, but go to <a href="/en/Manhattan/Chinatown" title="Manhattan/Chinatown">Chinatown</a> for the best Chinese ingredients, Little India in Murray Hill for Indian ingredients, <a href="/en/Queens/Flushing" title="Queens/Flushing" class="mw-redirect">Flushing</a> for all things Chinese or Korean, Jackson Heights for Peruvian, Ecuadorian, and Indian, Flatbush and Crown Heights for Jamaican, Williamsburg for Kosher, Greenpoint for Polish. Ask around for where you can get your favorite ethnic ingredients and you'll find traveling around in local neighborhoods a rewarding experience. There is also a Trader Joe's at Union Square for cheap but delicious supermarket buys. Western Beef Supermarkets offer more foods from different ethnicities than average supermarkets.
The only thing about New York City that changes faster than the subway map or the restaurants is the bar scene. While some established watering holes have been around for decades or centuries, the hot spot of the moment may well have opened last week and could likely close just as quickly.
The best way to find a decent bar is to ask the advice of a native dweller with trustworthy taste.
The following is a general overview of the popular neighborhoods for a night out. For more specific suggestions, see the relevant district pages.
Last call is 04:00, although many establishments will let you stay beyond that, especially in the outer boroughs. It is not uncommon to be locked in a bar after 04:00 so people can keep drinking.
Travelers from abroad should always follow local tipping customs when it comes to drinking at a bar. New York bartenders expect $1 for each drink served, even if it is a simple can of beer. The reason it's expected is that it represents the overwhelming majority of the bartender's wage. The bar owner typically does not pay the bar staff, with the exception of a symbolic "shift pay," which can be less than $5 an hour before taxes.  The result is that on a slow night a bartender may make close to nothing, whereas on a busy Saturday they can walk out with a great deal of cash.
Seasoned bartenders will not hesitate to remind the drinker of this custom, and it is sometimes assumed that non-tipping foreigners are consciously withholding tips despite knowing better. A customer who does not tip may find the level of service drop precipitously.
While those not accustomed to this system may object to essentially bankrolling the salary of the staff, note that many bartenders will "buy back" your 3rd or 4th round (i.e. you get it for free), which can balance it out.
In short, happy bartenders make happy customers, and your generosity will usually be rewarded.
In New York State (this includes NYC), wine and liquor are sold at liquor stores, and are not sold at delis or supermarkets. There are many located along 8th Avenue. The cheapest liquor store in Manhattan is Warehouse Wines and Spirits at 735 Broadway between Waverly Place and Astor Place, just a bit south of 8th Street. Beer cannot be bought 04:00-08:00 on Sunday morning (although if you look hard, you can get around this).
Liquor, wine and beer are almost always sold to you with a paper or plastic bag. Keep this bag on the alcohol. It is frowned upon to carry alcohol openly in the streets, as it is assumed you might be consuming it.
There are various local beers to try. Chelsea Brewing Company, Heartland Brewery, and Brooklyn Brewery are worth a visit.
In the United States, the legal drinking age is 21. Even if you're well over 21, make sure to keep your driver's license (sufficient for US &amp; Canadian citizens) or passport (sufficient for everyone else) on hand.  Especially in touristy neighborhoods, it's not uncommon to be asked to prove your age as a matter of policy or court order - even at a restaurant. Outside of the touristy areas, and especially in Brooklyn, people tend to be more relaxed.
New York has some of the most expensive accommodation in the world. Expect to pay up to $50 for a hostel, $100-$200 for a budget room with shared bath, $250-$350 for a mid-range hotel with a decent room and a restaurant and/or room service; right up to world famous luxury hotels such as the Waldorf Astoria or The Plaza, where a stay in the top suites can run into thousands of dollars a night.  There is no shortage of choice however as all of the major international hotel chains such as Hilton, Hyatt, Marriott and Holiday Inn each have multiple properties in Manhattan.  Most rooms below $200 in Manhattan are small with room for a bed, a tv, and little else. Be warned that the quality of hotels varies significantly and, in many cheap hotels away from the center such as along the West Side Highway or in the outer reaches of Queens, you may share the premises with hourly customers!
That said however, there <i>are</i> ways of finding accommodation in a big name mainstream hotel in Manhattan at lower prices - it takes some determination - but it can be done using the following tips:
Room rates are typically quoted excluding taxes, so expect your actual bill to be higher than the quoted rate. Taxes include New York State and New York City sales tax (8.875%), a New York City Hotel Occupancy Tax (varies but, for rooms above $40, $2 + 5.875%), and a surcharge of $1.50. <b>For a $100 per night room, expect to pay $117.75, after taxes are taken into account</b>.

It's worth keeping in mind that you don't have to stay in Manhattan.
In <a href="/en/Queens/Long_Island_City" title="Queens/Long Island City">Long Island City</a>, <a href="/en/Queens" title="Queens">Queens</a>, there are 10-15 clean and safe hotels in the region just across the Queensborough/59th Street Bridge from Manhattan. Accomodation here can cost as little as $50 per night. This area is being developed by the city as its new "hotel zone." Take advantage of it! Since the subway runs all night, you can go out in Manhattan and come back at any time.
Brooklyn has a sprawling amount of hotels. In the neighborhood of Park Slope alone there are over 5 hotels. With great access to public transportation and quick trips into Manhattan Brooklyn is definitely a borough you should look into.
Just over the Hudson River and out of the city limits, in <a href="/en/New_Jersey" title="New Jersey">New Jersey</a>, there are cheaper hotels, and Manhattan is easily accessible by a short 15-minute ferry ride, by train, by bus, or by a more expensive cab ride. However, public transit to and from New Jersey does not run as often as transportation within New York City, especially after midnight. Taking a cab to New Jersey can be difficult - at times, crossing the bridges and tunnels to New Jersey is painfully slow due to traffic.
Hotels close to Newark Airport can cost as little as $50 per night if booked online. However, to travel to Manhattan with public transportation can be complicated . Multiple transfers are required (airport shuttle to airport; #62 to Newark Penn Station; PATH train to the city), and services are of low frequency. Expect 1.5 to 2 hours each way from your Newark airport hotel to Manhattan.
<a href="/en/Jersey_City" title="Jersey City">Jersey City</a> can be easier - it's only a short hop from there to Midtown on the PATH.
Another option for customers coming from Newark Airport is to stay in <a href="/en/Staten_Island" title="Staten Island">Staten Island</a>. Some Staten Island hotels, such as The Hilton Garden Inn at 900 South Avenue, offer free shuttle buses or are on bus lines to the free St. George Ferry to Manhattan.  Do be aware though that Staten Island is a lot farther than it seems from the main attractions.
It is highly advised to stay with someone you know who lives in New York, New Jersey or south and western Connecticut. If you don't know anyone, you can look into a <a href="/en/Hospitality_exchange" title="Hospitality exchange">hospitality exchange</a>. New Yorkers love showing off their city and understand that hotels are expensive. Taking an old friend out to dinner one night in return for accommodation is far more economical than staying in a hotel - and you will get a real take on New York as opposed to just the tourist attractions.

Wi-Fi is available in city parks and quite a few public libraries. The Apple store has dozens of computers setup and doesn't seem to mind that many people use them for free internet access, but they can be pretty busy at times. Easy Internet Cafe and FedEx Office are just some of the internet cafes which offer broadband internet at reasonable prices. Finding a store with an open power outlet may be difficult so be sure your device is fully charged and its battery is working properly.
Public phones are found all over the city so carry quarters if you plan to use them. Remember to include the 1 and area code when dialing from any phone in New York City - including private "land line" phones in buildings - as 11-digit dialing is always in effect, even when dialing locally.
For choosing a mobile network OpenSignal provide crowdsourced <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://opensignal.com/coverage-maps/US/New%20York/">cellular coverage maps of New York</a> for comparing the carriers. Note, in US English "carrier" means "network" or "mobile network operator. Be aware that some operators (such as Sprint and Verizon) use CDMA, this means you cannot get a SIM from these carriers. In addition, operators may use different network bands to those your phone uses, make sure you check this. You can also find information on network bands used by each network on OpenSignal's network specific pages (e.g. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://opensignal.com/networks/usa/t-mobile-coverage">T-Mobile network coverage</a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://opensignal.com/networks/usa/at&amp;t-coverage">AT&amp;T network coverage</a>).
Commonly believed to be very dangerous, New York is statistically the safest large city in the United States, and its crime rate per person is actually lower than the national average and the crime rate of many small towns.  You can also be assured of a high police presence in Times Square, public transportation hubs and other major crowded places.
The most common crime against tourists (not including being overcharged!) is bag snatching. Never let go of your bag, especially in the subway but also when eating at a restaurant. Take special care if sitting outdoors or in a crowded self-service restaurant. Leave your passport and other valuables in a hotel safe or hidden in your suitcase, and don't flaunt a wad of money.
While muggings are rare, they do happen. Always be aware of your surroundings, especially if you find yourself on a lightly traveled or poorly lit street. Certain neighborhoods that are off the tourist path should be avoided in the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island. Riverside Park and Central Park can be dangerous at night. If you go to an evening outdoor concert at one of the parks, follow the crowd out of the park before heading toward your destination.
In a post 9/11 New York, airport style security is becoming a common sight at a growing list of buildings, museums and tourist attractions, even the Public Library. Generally you can expect to have your bags checked (either manually by a security guard or through an x-ray machine) and walk through a metal detector. Unlike their counterparts at JFK and LaGuardia, security screenings at building entrances are surprisingly quick and efficient - and you can even leave your shoes on!
If you think you've inadvertently wandered into a dangerous area, hop into a cab, if available, or into the nearest subway station and go elsewhere. If a subway platform is deserted, stay within sight of the station agent if possible. Otherwise, if you are on the streets of an unfamiliar neighborhood, acting like you know where you're going - even if you don't - goes a long way. Criminals tend to look for easy targets - don't be one!
New York has its share of odd people: talkative pan-handlers, lonely people just wanting a chat, religious preachers, people with psychological disorders, etc. If you prefer not to speak with someone who approaches you for a chat, do what most New Yorkers do: completely ignore them or say "Sorry, gotta go" while continuing to walk at a brisk pace.
Despite the stereotypes, many New Yorkers are nice people and don't mind giving out directions (time allowing), so don't be afraid to ask! If you ever get into trouble, approach the nearest police officer. You'll find them to be friendly, polite, and very helpful.
Here are a few unofficial maps that can help you avoid inadvertantly wandering into a higher-crime area.
Smoking in public places is highly restricted. It is prohibited in indoor sections of bars, restaurants, subway stations and trains (all transit system property), public parks, public beaches, pedestrian malls, both indoor and outdoor stadiums and sports arenas, and many other public places. If you light up in any of these places, you are subject to a summons and fine, ejection, and/or indignant reactions from residents. There do remain a small number of legal cigar bars that are exempt, as are the outside areas of sidewalk cafes and the like, but these are very much the exception. If you need to smoke while eating or drinking, be prepared to take a break and join the rest of the smokers outside, whatever the weather; many establishments have large space heaters. As in most US cities, drinking alcoholic beverages on the street is illegal, so bars will not let you take your drink outside.
Not a complete list.
Locals would ask why you ever want to leave, but New York is a great jumping-off point to other locations in the <a href="/en/Metro_New_York" title="Metro New York">metro area</a> (including <a href="/en/New_Jersey" title="New Jersey">New Jersey</a> and <a href="/en/Connecticut" title="Connecticut">Connecticut</a>) or anywhere in the <a href="/en/Boston" title="Boston">Boston</a>-<a href="/en/Washington,_D.C." title="Washington, D.C.">Washington</a> Megalopolis corridor.
