<b>Taipei</b> (å°å or èºå; <i>TÃ¡ibÄi</i>) <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://english.taipei.gov.tw/">[1]</a> is the national capital of <a href="/en/Taiwan" title="Taiwan">Taiwan</a>. It is in the northern part of the island in a basin between the Yangming Mountains and the Central Mountains. It is, with 2.6 million inhabitants, the fourth largest administrative area of Taiwan, after <a href="/en/New_Taipei" title="New Taipei">New Taipei</a>, <a href="/en/Kaohsiung" title="Kaohsiung">Kaohsiung</a> and <a href="/en/Taichung" title="Taichung">Taichung</a>. However, the Greater Taipei metropolitan area, which encompasses the central Taipei City along with the surrounding New Taipei City and Keelung, represents the largest urban cluster in Taiwan with nearly 7 million people. Taipei serves as the island's financial, cultural and governmental centre.
<br clear="all" />
Taipei City administers twelve <b>districts</b> (å):
<br />
Taipei is surrounded by <a href="/en/New_Taipei" title="New Taipei">New Taipei</a> (æ°åå¸), the largest city of Taiwan by population and surface area. Taipei, New Taipei and <a href="/en/Keelung" title="Keelung">Keelung</a> (åºéå¸), are basically one metropolitan area, but are run by three different government authorities.
In 1884, the Qing dynasty governor of Taiwan, Liu Mingchuan, decided to move the prefecture capital to Taipei, and with the construction of government offices and the influx of civil servants, Taipei's days as a sleepy market town were over. Taipei remained the provincial capital when Taiwan was granted provincial status in 1885. As Taipei is in the north of Taiwan (the closest area to Japan), the city continued to thrive when Taiwan was ceded to Japan in 1895. However, as Japan was in the throes of a 'modernize-come-what-may' period, little regard was paid to Taipei's traditional Chinese-style architecture and many of the old buildings, including the city walls, were demolished. On the other hand, several European-style buildings were constructed by the Japanese rulers - the Presidential Palace and National Taiwan University being among the most famous. The city's architecture, however, suffered another major onslaught when the KMT government arrived from mainland China in 1945.
To cope with the influx of millions of mainland refugees, temporary housing estates sprang up all around the city. Later, these were replaced by Soviet-era style (or 'no-style') concrete apartment buildings. These buildings characterized Taipei's landscape until very recently.
In the 1980s, Taiwan's economy began to take off. Wages increased and in order to satisfy a wealthy and sophisticated market, Taipei began to change. Wide, tree lined boulevards were laid, high quality apartment blocks constructed and stylish restaurants and cafes established. The city was booming and has never looked back since.
The Taipei of today is a confident city of about 2.5 million inhabitants (about seven million including suburbs), and is characterized by its friendly people and safe streets. While it is not usually high on the list of tourist destinations, it is a fascinating place to visit and live. Furthermore, despite its size, Taipei does not have any rough areas that are considered unsafe, even at night - which in itself is attractive.
The downtown area is culturally divided into East and West. The West side, with its narrow streets and road side vendors, is considered the bastion of old Taipei life, whereas East Taipei, with its classy malls, chic boutiques, and stylish restaurants and cafes, reminiscent of those found in Tokyo, Paris or New York represents the city's metamorphosis into a modern and international city.
Taipei has a semi-tropical climate characterized by hot and humid weather. The most comfortable season to visit is the fall, when the rainfall is at its lowest and the temperatures average a pleasant mid 20Â°C. February to April are particularly damp with little sunlight, while the summers can be very hot, but often punctuated by heavy thunder showers. Taipei is prone to typhoons from May to October, though the highest concentrations are in August and September. Winters can be quite chilly, with temperatures occasionally falling below 10Â°C at night, though snowfall has never been known to occur.
Taipei's international airport is officially called <b>Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.taoyuanairport.gov.tw/english">[5]</a> (å°ç£æ¡ååéæ©å ´) (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IATA" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:IATA">IATA</a>: <b>TPE</b>). However, the name was changed only in September 2006 and the old name,  <b>Chiang Kai Shek International Airport</b> (often abbreviated as <b>CKS</b>), is still commonly used. Many airlines fly to the Taoyuan International Airport. The airport is located about 30 km from the city and freeway buses ply the route, picking up and dropping off passengers at most of the five star hotels. It also stops at the Taipei Main Station and the domestic airport (Songshan Airport), which is in downtown Taipei. There are also bus services  connecting the airport to nearby cities and <a href="/en/Taichung" title="Taichung">Taichung</a> in central Taiwan. Travelers to other destinations need to change transportation in Taipei.
There are four transportation options at the airport: bus, high speed rail, taxi, and pre-arranged sedan. An MRT line is under construction, but it will not be completed until October 2014. Here are the options from cheapest to most expensive forms of transportation:
<b>Express airport buses</b> cost between NT$120 and NT$150 depending on the bus company, and there are stops at both terminals. Most Taipei routes are divided into West and East, with each company operating a service every ten to fifteen minutes on each route. The western line bus terminates at Taipei Main Railway Station and also makes a stop at Yuanshan MRT Station on the Xindian line (NB: The Airbus company buses on the western line meander through local towns before joining the freeway and therefore take much longer than the blue and white Guoguang buses which enter the freeway directly). Buses plying the eastern route terminate at the Taipei Grand Hyatt Hotel and make a stop at Zhongxiao-Fuxing MRT Station on the Nangang and Muzha lines. There is also a bus connecting to the domestic Songshan Airport. Ticket counters display route maps showing all stops.
In addition, there are some <b>non-express buses</b> which are slightly cheaper, but pass through towns such as Taoyuan (æ¡å), Nankan (åå´) or Kueishan (é¾å±±) before arriving in Taipei.
When returning to the airport, express buses can be caught at various stops throughout the city. One major one leaves every 15-20 minutes from Taipei West Bus Station adjacent to Taipei Main Railway Station (near MRT exit M5 and underground mall exits K12 and Z3). Another is at the terminal at the Songshan Domestic Airport (æ¾å±±æ©å ´). Other stops are outside major hotels and also in front of Minsheng MRT Station. For people taking early morning flights, the earliest available buses to the airport leave at around 4AM from the Far Eastern Plaza Hotel (å°åé æ±åéå¤§é£¯åº) (201 Dunhua South Rd Section 2). Be sure to prepare change for the bus fare as change will not be given for tickets purchased directly on the bus.
It is also easy to get to the <b>High Speed Rail station</b> from the airport. There is a bus that runs approximately every 15 minutes from the airport to the Taoyuan High Speed Rail station. From there, you can catch one of the HSR trains to Taipei Main Station (where it is easy to take a taxi or MRT to your final destination). The bus is NT$30 and the train is NT$160.  On the way back, there are check-in counters at the station for China Airlines, EVA and UNI flights.
A one-way <b>taxi</b> fare between the airport and Taipei will cost at the minimum NT$900 (generally NT$1000-$1200 from the airport). In Taipei, don't make the mistake of asking a taxi driver to take you to the Taipei airport (Songshan) if you actually mean Taiwan Taoyuan Airport. The international airport is actually about an hour's drive from Taipei, while Songshan is in downtown Taipei.
A one-way <b>pre-arranged sedan</b> fare between the airport and Taipei will cost at the minimum NT$1300-$1500. Generally these sedans are pre-arranged through your hotel and the sedan company or driver will meet you as soon as you exit baggage claim. Since the price is not much more than taking a taxi, it is usually recommended that you ask your hotel if they offer this service. This is a more comfortable half-hour ride to the hotel.
Direct <b>bus connections</b> between the airport and other cities in Taiwan are also available.  U-bus also runs shuttle buses every 15 min from both terminals to THSR Taoyuan station (15 min away), from where you can continue your journey by high-speed train.
In addition to the transit hotel within the airport terminal, there are several hotels located near the airport if you desire more comfortable quarters for an extended transit or for some other reason would rather lodge by the airport than in Taipei. The Novotel Taoyuan International Airport, located next to the China Airlines headquarters building, is mere minutes from both terminals and has commanding views of the airport's runways. Also nearby is the <b>CitySuites Gateway Hotel</b>, 10 minutes from the Cing-pu High-speed Rail Station and three minutes away from Taoyuan International Airport. <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.hpw.com.tw/hotel/new_en.asp#">[6]</a>. Another inexpensive option is a nearby love motel <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://sukuoliang.myweb.hinet.net/">[7]</a>
<b>Night sevice</b>
There is, although it's really hard to find information about it. Best source is the airport website <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.taoyuan-airport.com/english/Publish.jsp?cnid=100150">[8]</a>. As of 21Feb2012 there is overnight bus service to Taipei Railway station as follows: 1:30am, 3:00am for Terminal 1 (exit B5), add 10 mins for Terminal 2 (bus station, 1819 stand). Ticket is purchased from the driver as the ticket counter will be closed - 165 NT$. <i>Unconfirmed - one extra departs at 04:00, Wednesday &amp; Saturday at Terminal 2 Without Detouring Terminal 1.</i> From the Taipei Railway you can take overnight train to connect to other cities or bus from the adherent bus station. It takes about 55 min from the airport to the city (at night).
Songshan Airport (æ¾å±±æ©å ´) at the northern end of Dunhua North Rd is the city's domestic airport, as well as serving a few select international routes to regional destinations. There are numerous daily flights arriving and departing for all major cities on the island and the outlying islands. The airport also serves flights to mainland China and Haneda International Airport in Tokyo, Japan.  The airport is served by the Metro Brown Line's (officially labeled the Wenshan-Neihu Line) Songshan Airport Station and can be reached in about 20 minutes from the city's main railway station.
All inter-city trains <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.railway.gov.tw/en/index/index.aspx">[9]</a>, including those operated by the Taiwan High Speed Rail (å°ç£é«éµ) <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.thsrc.com.tw/en/index.htm">[10]</a>, arrive at and depart from Taipei Railway Station (å°åè»ç«) on Zhongxiao West Road, Sec 1 - opposite the 53 story Shinkong Mitsukoshi Building (æ°åä¸è¶). Taipei Main Station is a huge facility. Ticket counters are on the first floor and platforms in B1. There is also a food court on the second floor, several underground shopping malls, an auditorium on the 5th floor and MRT stations serving three lines. In addition to ticket counters, the first floor also has a tourist office, small supermarkets, a post office, stores selling aboriginal handicrafts and several booths offering head and neck and full body massage (NT$100 for ten minutes).
The THSR stations and platforms are wheelchair-friendly and all trains include a wheelchair-accessible carriage (wider doors, ample space, accessible toilet). Note that the official English guide for online reservations distinguishes between "senior or disabled tickets" and "handicap-friendly seats"; while it's possible to buy a ticket for the former online ("correct passenger ID" required), a ticket for the latter has to be reserved by calling the ticketing office on the phone.
Intercity buses arrive and depart from the Taipei Bus Terminal, which is located on Chengde Road, behind Taipei Main Station. Generally speaking, the buses operated by private companies are more comfortable and sport such amenities as wide reclining seats and individual game and video monitors. The government run buses are blue and white and are called <i>guÃ³guÄng hÃ o</i> (ååè). All intercity buses are known as <i>kÃ¨yÃ¹n</i> (å®¢é) and can be distinguished from the local city buses called <i>gÅngchÄ</i> (å¬è») by the fact that they do not have a route number, but only the name of the destination.
Taipei City has a very clean, efficient and safe Mass Rapid Transit system <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.trtc.com.tw/e/">[11]</a> known most commonly as the <b>MRT</b>, but also called <b>Metro Taipei</b> (å°åæ·é). Muzha line, which connects to Taipei Zoo, is a driverless elevated system. The last trains depart at midnight. Fares are between NT$20 and NT$65 for one-way trips around town. Stations and trains are clearly identified in English, so even for those who cannot read Chinese, the MRT system is very accessible. All stops are announced in four languages: Mandarin, Taiwanese, Hakka and English. Most stations have information booth/ticket offices close to the ticket vending machines. There is no eating or drinking while in the stations or on the trains. Trains generally run from 6AM to midnight, with convenient bus connections outside the stations.
Women and/or children traveling at night can benefit from the <b>Safe Zones</b> - sections of platforms that are under heavy surveillance - located in some of the subway lines. Stations and trains (including the monorail) are wheelchair-friendly, but note that when there are multiple exits from a single station, usually only one of these is equipped with a lift.
In addition to single journey tickets, the Taipei MRT also sells value-added cards/smartcards called <b>EasyCard</b> (æ éå¡). These cards hold amounts up to NT$5,000, and one only needs to "touch" (sensor) them past the barrier monitor to gain entry and exit. Value added cards can be purchased at station ticket offices or at vending machines. One great advantage of using the EasyCard is that there is a 20% discount on all MRT rides, and if you transfer from the MRT to an ordinary city bus, or vice versa, within an hour, the bus ride is only NT$7. The discount is automatically calculated when you leave the MRT station. Student cards with even deeper discounts are also available for purchase, but only upon request at a desk and a student ID. The EasyCard can be recharged at convenience stores and subway stations. In addition to the subway and buses, some parking lots also offer an option to pay with the EasyCard. To purchase a new EasyCard you will need to pay NT$500 (including a deposit of NT$100 and NT$400 usable credit). It is also possible to buy day cards just for the metro system for NT$200 (refundable deposit of NT$50)and for NT$180 you can buy a card that works on both the metro and buses. Alternatively, the Taipei Pass costs NT$250 (no deposit) and covers travel on the metro and Maokong Gondola for one day. These are very convenient and if you are doing more than 6 or 8 journeys in a day, will also cover their cost (Prices at Feb 2012). For more information, see their website <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.easycard.com.tw/english/index.asp">[12]</a>. In recent times, major convenience stores such as 7-11, as well as various other retail outlets have begun to accept the card as payment.
Often times limited-edition cards are issued by the transit authority depicting artworks, famous characters, landscapes, etc. These are quite collectible and are perfect souvenirs for your trip. Remember single-journey tokens are recycled when you exit the stations, so if you want to keep a particular one you should purchase an extra.
Taipei City has a very efficient bus service <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.e-bus.taipei.gov.tw/">[13]</a>, and because all buses display information (destination and the names of stops) in English, the system is very accessible to non-Chinese speaking visitors. <b>Payment</b> can be made by cash (NT$15) or EasyCard (see "metro" listing) for each section that the bus passes through. For local buses (all local buses have a number, but long distance buses do not) the maximum will be two sections with a total cost of NT$30. The confusion, however, arises by not knowing where the section boundaries are located and the fact that there is often a buffer zone to prevent people who get on one stop before the boundary from overpayment.
<b>When to pay</b> Above the driver, there is an electronic red sign. If the Chinese character for "up" (ä¸) is lit, then you pay when you get on. If the same sign is lit when you get off, you do not need to pay again. However, if the sign is displaying the Chinese character for "down" (ä¸) when you are getting off, then you will need to pay a second time. Finally, if the character for "down" is lit up when you get on, then you need to pay only when you get off. Until you get the hang of the system, just let the locals go first and follow their action. It's really not as complicated as it sounds, and bus drivers won't let you forget a second payment if you owe one!
Besides, if you are transferring from the transit system to a bus within one hour, there is a discounted bus fare.
Taxis are the most flexible way to get around, and are extremely numerous. They are expensive in comparison to mass transit, but are cheap when compared to taxis in the rest of the world. Most taxi drivers cannot speak English, and it will be necessary for non-Chinese speakers to have their <b>destination written down in Chinese</b>. Taxis are metered, with higher rates for night (an additional NT$20 over the meter). <b>Tipping</b> is neither necessary nor expected.
Since 2012, all passengers are required to buckle their seatbelt. Women and/or children traveling at night are advised to use one of the reputable taxi companies. The toll free taxi hotline is 0800-055850 (maintained by Department of Transportation).
Taiwanese taxi drivers tend to be more honest than in many other countries. They are notorious for their strong opinions on politics. A large majority of them support Taiwan independence as they spend all day listening to talk radio. They will probably be unable to share any of this with you if you do not speak Chinese. Avoid any potential political discussion.
It is not advisable for lone women at night to hail a random taxi from the street - it is best to have the number of one of the bigger taxi companies and to call for a cab. Taking a taxi at night in Taipei is more dangerous than walking.
Even though motorized traffic is very heavy in Taipei, bicycles are still legitimate vehicles to get around. There are long cycle paths beside most rivers in the city. Bicycles can also be carried on the Taipei metro but only at certain times and via certain stations - bicycles aren't permitted in larger interchange stations such as Taipei Main Station and Zhongxiao Fuxing, and bicycles are only permitted in the first and last carriages. Unlike Mainland China, there are no segregated bike lanes but on the busiest streets cycling on the pavement (US English: sidewalk) is permitted, as in Japan.
Renting a car is not only unnecessary, but not recommended in Taipei unless you are planning to head out of the city. Traffic tends to be frantic, and parking spaces are expensive and difficult to find. Most of the main tourist destinations are reachable by public transport, and you should use that as your main mode of travel.
The Taipei address system is very logical and user-friendly. The hub of the city is the corner of the east-west running Zhongxiao (å¿ å­) and north-south running Zhongshan (ä¸­å±±) Rds, however while the north/south divide is made at Zhongxiao here, further east it is made instead at Bade (å«å¾·) Rd, something which confuses even people who have lived in Taipei for years. All major roads are identified by their direction in relation to these roads. For example, all sections of the north-south running Fuxing (å¾©è) Rd north of Bade are called Fuxing North Rd (å¾©èåè·¯). Likewise, those sections to the south are called Fuxing South Rd (å¾©èåè·¯). Those that cross Zhongshan road are similarly identified as either east or west. Section (æ®µ; duÃ n) numbers begin at 'one' near the two defining roads and increase at intersections of major highways. For example, Ren'ai (ä»æ) Rd (which has only an east location and therefore does not have a direction suffix), Section 1 will be close to Zhongshan South Rd. The section number will increase as one moves further away from Zhongshan Rd. So, for example, when Ren'ai Rd reaches Dunhua South Rd (æ¦ååè·¯) far in the east of the city, a typical address could be: 7F, 166 Ren'ai Rd, Section 4. The house and lane numbers begin at zero every section. Lanes (å··; xiÃ ng) lead off roads (è·¯; lÃ¹) and streets (è¡; jiÄ), while alleys (å¼; nÃ²ng) branch off lanes.
Taipei is a city of people from many different origins, and you can find a good mix of Chinese (people whose families migrated to Taiwan from 1949 onwards) and native Taiwanese (people whose families had been in Taiwan since the Ming or Qing Dynasties). While <a href="/en/Chinese_phrasebook" title="Chinese phrasebook">Mandarin</a> is the <i>lingua franca</i>, and is spoken and understood by most people under the age of 60, other Chinese "dialects" are commonly heard as well. Among the native Taiwanese, while speakers of <a href="/en/Minnan_phrasebook" title="Minnan phrasebook">Minnan</a> form the majority, there is also a significant number of Hakka-speaking native Taiwanese living in Taipei.
<b>English</b> is compulsory in all Taiwanese schools, and most people under the age of 40 will have at least a basic grasp of English, though few are fluent. Nevertheless, it goes without saying that learning some Mandarin and/or Minnan will make your trip much smoother.

Taipei has often been skipped by tourists in favour of its East Asian rivals such as Hong Kong, Shanghai and Tokyo, but those who take the time to visit Taipei and look around will soon find that Taipei is just as vibrant as any other major city, and is full of a certain charm which makes it unique in its own right. Just spend a day wandering around Taipei's streets and you will start finding many surprises.
<br />
In the South of Datong District, <b>Dadaocheng</b> (å¤§ç¨»å) is a historic heart of Taipei. Dadaocheng, it can be literally translated as <i>large open space for drying rice in the sun</i>. There is one of the oldest communities in Taipei. Getting this old area, you can take the Danshui Line (Red Line) MRT to Shuanglian Station. From Exit 2, walk west down Minsheng West Road (about 15 minutes).
<b>Dalongdong</b> (å¤§é¾å³) is at the Datong District's north end, north of Dadaocheng and is one of the oldest communities in Taipei. Baoan Temple and Confucius Temple are both famous historical sites located in this area.
Even though very little ancient architecture remains in Taipei, four of Taipei's five original city gates still stand. The city walls which surrounded the old city and the West Gate were demolished by the Japanese to make way for roads and railway lines. Of the four gates still standing, the Kuomintang renovated three of them in its effort to "sinicize" Taipei and converted them from the original southern Chinese architecture to northern Chinese palace style architecture, leaving only the <b>North Gate</b> (<b>beimen</b> åé or more formally <b>Cheng'en men</b> æ¿æ©é) in its original Qing Dynasty splendour today. This gate sits forlornly in the traffic circle where the Zhonghua, Yanping and Boai roads meet.
Hot springs come in various brands in Taipei, ranging from basic, to plush spas at five star hotels. The basic free 'rub and scrub' type public baths are run by the city. Most hotels offer the option of a large sex-segregated bathing area that generally consists of several large baths of various temperatures, jacuzzi, sauna and steam bath and also private and family rooms (NB: the law in Taiwan states that for safety reasons, individuals are not allowed to bathe in the private rooms, and there must be at least two people). Some hotels also have outdoor baths (é²å¤©æº«æ³), which offer restful views over the surrounding country-side. Prices range from around NT$300 to NT$800.<b> Public hot spring etiquette</b> requires that bathers thoroughly wash and rinse off their bodies before entering the bath, do not wear clothing, including swim wear (though this is not the case for mixed-sex public areas) in the bath and tie up their hair so that it does not touch the water. Finally, people with high blood pressure, heart disease or open wounds should not enter the baths.
There are three main places to have a soak in the Taipei area:
Hiking is a popular exercise in Taipei. The main hiking spot in Taipei is <a href="/en/Yangmingshan_National_Park" title="Yangmingshan National Park">Yangmingshan National Park</a> (é½æå±±åå®¶å¬å). There are dozens of hiking trails in the park.
Taipei hosts numerous festivals throughout the year, but as many follow the lunar calendar the dates according to the Gregorian calendar are inconsistent. Unless you possess a lunar calendar, it is recommended you check the Taiwan Tourist Bureau's events section before planning to attend an event.

It is often said that L.A. has no center. In contrast, one could say that Taipei is all center, and as such it has been given the epithet - "the emporium without end." Basically, however, the main shopping area can be divided into two districts: East and West. West Taipei is the old city and is characterized by narrow streets packed with small shops. The Western  district is also home to most government buildings and the Taipei Main Station. East Taipei boasts wide tree lined boulevards and the four main shopping malls are located in this area. Popular shopping destinations in East Taipei consist of the area around the ZhongXiao-DunHua intersection and Taipei 101.
East Taipei is also famous for the small stores inside the alleys. Having massive flow of people for both fancy and local dinning, <b>216 Lane</b> with <b>Din Tai Fung</b> and <b>688 Beef noodle</b> is always crowded in holidays. On the other hand, <b>Daan Road</b> in the other side of the area, has more elegant clothing shops. Beside the intersection of Zhongxiao East Road and Daan Road stands <b>Bistro 98</b>, a ten-story building with stylish restaurants. Other alleys also  have an interesting array of small shops and boutiques. <b>Buddha Statues</b>, prayer flags and other artifacts associated with Tibetan Buddhism can be purchased at <b>Potala</b>, 2F, 2-4, Lane 51, Da'an Rd. Tel:<i>+886 2</i> 2741-6906. The staff speaks English and the prices are reasonable. For those interested in all things Nepalese you should check out <b>Jay Shiva Shamyoo Himalayan Handicrafts</b>, located in the basement of 1 Lane 146, Zhongxiao East Road, sec. 4. Tel:<i>+886 2</i> 2740 2828.
<b>NB</b>: In order to protect the environment, a government policy rules that plastic bags cannot be given freely at stores in Taiwan, but have to be bought (NT$1) - bakeries being an exception as the items need to be hygienically wrapped. Re-usable canvas and nylon bags are sold at most supermarkets.
Teaching English (or to a lesser extent, other foreign languages) is perhaps the easiest way to work in Taiwan. Work permits will be hard to come by and will take time. Consult your local Taiwan consulate/embassy/representative as far in advance as possible.
It should be noted that anyone staying in Taiwan for an extended period of time can FIND English teaching work, albeit technically illegally. If you are staying as a student or for some other long term purpose, it should be noted that many people are teaching English (or some other language) for pay without a permit in Taipei and elsewhere in Taiwan.

Taipei probably has one of the highest densities of restaurants in the world. Almost every street and alley offers some kind of eatery. Of course, Chinese food (from all provinces) is well represented. In addition, Thai, Vietnamese, Japanese, Korean and Italian cuisines are also popular. Basically, East Taipei, especially around Dunhua and Anhe Roads, and also the expat enclave of Tianmu are where to clash chopsticks with the rich and famous, whereas West Taipei offers more smaller, homey restaurants.
Due to the sheer number of restaurants, it is almost impossible to compile a thorough list, but below are a few recommended restaurants catering to specialist tastes.
<br />
Several night markets (å¤å¸) are located in each district. Some are open during daytime, and all are open until around midnight. Night markets consists of restaurants and stores at the permanent locations and little booths along the center. Every night market has a huge variety of food, so any night market you find is a good bet for good food. Because of the vast selection, the recommendation is to go with a few people and share the food. Vendor food is generally safe to eat, but use common sense though if you have a sensitive stomach!
The most famous one in Taipei is the <b>Shilin Night Market</b> (å£«æå¤å¸). It is easilly accessible via the MRT at either the Jiantan (åæ½­) or Shilin (å£«æ) stations.
Locals in Taipei view Shilin as touristy, with food catering to the tastes of mainland visitors. Another excellent option is <b>Ning Xia Yeshi</b>.
Some of the best known night market snacks are:
<b>Oyster omelet</b><br />èµä»ç; Ã´-Ã¡-chian
<b>Tianbula</b><br />çä¸è¾£; tiÃ¡nbÃºlÃ <br />Literally "Sweet, not spicy", is a Taiwanese version of Tempura.
<b>Stinky tofu</b> <br />è­è±è; chÃ²udÃ²ufÇ
<b>Mango ice</b><br />èæå°; mÃ¡ngguÇbÄ«ng
<b>Pan fried pork buns</b><br />æ°´çå; shuÇjiÄnbÄo
<b>Taiwanese sausage</b><br />é¦è¸; xiÄngchÃ¡ng

Pizza is easy to find in Taiwan with major chains such as Pizza Hut and Domino's. Besides the usual variety, Taiwan also has its localized variants e.g. seafood supreme, pepper steak, corn, peas etc.
Vegetarian food (ç´ é£) is also common fare, with the city boasting more than two hundred vegetarian restaurants and vendor stands. Another Taipei specialty is <b>vegetarian buffets</b>. They are common in every neighborhood, and unlike the 'all-you-can-eat' buffets listed below (which charge a set price, usually ranging from NT$250 - NT$350 including dessert and coffee/tea), the cost is estimated by the weight of the food on your plate. Rice (there is usually a choice of brown or white) is charged separately, but soup is free and you can refill as many times as you like. NT$75-120 will buy you a good sized, nutritious meal. Note that many of these veggie restaurants are Buddhist in nature and so meals do not contain garlic or onion (which traditionalists claim inflames passion).

Taiwan's speciality tea is <i>High Mountain Oolong</i> (é«å±±çé¾, a fragrant, light tea) and <i>Tieguanyin</i> (éµè§é³, a dark, rich brew).
The mountainous <b>Maokong</b> area of Muzha in the <a href="/en/Taipei/Wenshan" title="Taipei/Wenshan">Wenshan district</a> of the city has dozens upon dozens of teahouses, many of which also offer panoramic views of the city. Its especially spectacular on a clear evening. A <b>Maokong Gondola</b> (cable car) system <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://gondola.trtc.com.tw/english.asp">[90]</a> services the Taipei Zoo MRT station to Maokong. The S10 bus comes up from the Wanfang Community MRT station.
Nothing is better on a hot and humid Taipei day than a refreshing glass of juice made from a huge assortment of fresh fruit!
While traditionally a nation of tea drinkers, in recent years the Taiwanese have really embraced the cafe culture, and all the usual chains can be found here in abundance. For cafes with more character, roam the back streets near National Taiwan University between Xinsheng South Road and Roosevelt Road. More cafes are located in the area around Renai Road, Section 4 and Dunhua South Road. There are also some interesting and characterful places between Yongkang Park and Chaozhou Street, and in the alleys around Shida Road.  However, for a particularly impressive range of styles, visit Bitan in <a href="/en/Xindian" title="Xindian">Xindian</a>, where all the cafes offer restful views over the river and mountains beyond (though can be noisy at weekend).

Mobile phone coverage is relatively good in Taipei. Among the major providers are <b>Chunghwa Telecom</b> (ä¸­è¯é»ä¿¡), <b>Taiwan Mobile</b> (å°ç£å¤§å¥å¤§), <b>Vibo</b> (å¨å¯¶é»è¨) and <b>Far EasTone</b> (é å³é»è¨). Taipei has both GSM 900/1800 and 3G networks and roaming might be possible for users of such mobile phones, subject to agreements between operators. Most payphones work with telephone cards (é»è©±å¡) which are available at all convenience stores.
For up-to-date information on cheap flights, check the advertisement pages of one of the three local daily English newspapers (see 'Media'section below).
Taiwan has a very free and liberal press. There are three daily local newspapers available in English, <b>the China Post</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.chinapost.com.tw/">[124]</a>, <b>the Taipei Times</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/">[125]</a>, and <b>the Taiwan News</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.etaiwannews.com/">[126]</a>. Note that most media in Taiwan has a political slant; the China Post is more pan-blue while Taipei Times and Taiwan News are more pan-green.
Free magazines and information are available from the following:
Internet cafes are plentiful, especially in the maze of alleys between Taipei Main Station and Peace Park. However, you may have to wander around (and look up and down as many are on higher floors or in the basement) before finding one. Some computers are coin operated. Internet cafes are known as <i>wang-ka</i> in Chinese (a combination of <i>wang</i>, the Chinese word for 'net', and <i>ka</i> an abbreviation of 'cafe'.)
Below is a list of a few recommended internet cafes:
Taipei also has a city-wide wi fi service called Wifly <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.wifly.com.tw/">[130]</a>. For a small fee, you can buy a card that gives you unlimited internet access nearly anywhere in the city for a day or a month. The card costs NT$100 for 1 day of unlimited access and NT$500 for 31 days of unlimited access and can be purchased in Starbucks Coffee Shops, 7 eleven stores or online ( connect via wifi to wifly network for details).
Taipei is one of the safest cities you will ever visit, and violent crime is extremely rare. However, as in many large cities, pickpockets operate in crowded areas, and so you should be vigilant in night markets.
Local police are a resource you can turn for help, and many officers speak at least basic English.
