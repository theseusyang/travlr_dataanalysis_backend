<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://bangkoktourist.com"><b>Bangkok</b></a> (Thai: à¸à¸£à¸¸à¸à¹à¸à¸à¸¯ <i>Krung Thep Maha Nakhon</i>)  is the capital of <a href="/en/Thailand" title="Thailand">Thailand</a> and, with a population of over eleven million inhabitants, by far its largest city. Its high-rise buildings, heavy traffic congestion, intense heat and naughty nightlife may not immediately give you the best impression â but don't let that mislead you. It is one of Asia's most cosmopolitan cities with magnificent temples and palaces, authentic canals, busy markets and a vibrant nightlife that has something for everyone.
For years, it was only a small trading post at the banks of the Chao Phraya River, until King Rama I, the first monarch of the present Chakri dynasty, turned it into the capital of Siam in 1782, after the burning of <a href="/en/Ayutthaya" title="Ayutthaya">Ayutthaya</a> by Burmese invaders but they did not take over Ayutthaya. Since then, Bangkok has turned into a national treasure house and functions as Thailand's spiritual, cultural, political, commercial, educational and diplomatic centre.
Bangkok is a huge and modern city humming with nightlife and fervour. Administratively, it is split up into 50 districts (à¹à¸à¸ <i>khet</i>), which are further split into 154 subdistricts (à¹à¸à¸§à¸ <i>khwaeng</i>), but these are more often used in official business and for addresses. Visitors will find the conceptual division below of the main areas more useful for getting around.
Around Bangkok are the provinces of <a href="/en/Nakhon_Pathom" title="Nakhon Pathom">Nakhon Pathom</a> to the west, <a href="/en/Nonthaburi" title="Nonthaburi">Nonthaburi</a> to the northwest, <a href="/en/Pathum_Thani" title="Pathum Thani">Pathum Thani</a> to the north, <a href="/en/Chachoengsao" title="Chachoengsao">Chachoengsao</a> to the east, <a href="/en/Samut_Prakan" title="Samut Prakan">Samut Prakan</a> to the southeast and <a href="/en/Samut_Sakhon" title="Samut Sakhon">Samut Sakhon</a> to the southwest.
Just under 14 degrees north of the Equator, Bangkok is a tropical metropolis that is also one of the most traveller-friendly cities in Asia. A furious assault on the senses, visitors are immediately confronted by the heat, the pollution and the irrepressible smile that accompanies many Thais. Despite the sensationalised international news reports and first impressions, the city is surprisingly <b>safe</b> (except from some petty crimes) and more organised than it initially appears, and full of <b>hidden gems</b> waiting to be discovered. The high relative humidity and warm temperature favour the growth of tropical plants â you'll find exotic orchids and delicious fruit everywhere. Bougainvillea and frangipani bloom practically all over the city. Thai cuisine is justifiably famous, varied, and affordable. Bangkok for many represents the quintessential Asian capital. Saffron-robed monks, garish neon signs, graceful Thai architecture, spicy dishes, colourful markets, traffic jams and the tropical climate come together in a happy coincidence. It is difficult to leave with lukewarm impressions of the city.
"Bangkok" originally was a small village on the west bank of the Chao Phraya River. After the fall of <a href="/en/Ayutthaya" title="Ayutthaya">Ayutthaya</a> in the late 18th century, King Taksin the Great turned that village into Siam's new capital and renamed it <a href="/en/Bangkok/Thonburi" title="Bangkok/Thonburi">Thonburi</a>. In 1782, King Rama I moved the capital to the eastern bank of the river at <a href="/en/Bangkok/Rattanakosin" title="Bangkok/Rattanakosin">Rattanakosin</a>; originally the site of a Chinese community, who were moved outside of the new city walls to <a href="/en/Bangkok/Yaowarat_and_Phahurat" title="Bangkok/Yaowarat and Phahurat">Yaowarat</a>. King Rama I named the city <i>Krung Thep</i>, as it is now known to Thais and which in English is translates as the "City of Angels".
The full name <i>"Krung thep mahanakhon amorn ratanakosin mahintharayutthaya mahadilok popnoparat ratchathani burirom udomratchanivetmahasathan amornpiman avatarnsathit sakkathattiyavisnukarmprasit"</i> (à¸à¸£à¸¸à¸à¹à¸à¸à¸¡à¸«à¸²à¸à¸à¸£ à¸­à¸¡à¸£à¸£à¸±à¸à¸à¹à¸à¸ªà¸´à¸à¸à¸£à¹ à¸¡à¸«à¸´à¸à¸à¸£à¸²à¸¢à¸¸à¸à¸¢à¸²à¸¡à¸«à¸²à¸à¸´à¸¥à¸à¸ à¸ à¸à¸à¸£à¸±à¸à¸à¹à¸£à¸²à¸à¸à¸²à¸à¸µ à¸à¸¸à¸£à¸µà¸£à¸¡à¸¢à¹à¸­à¸¸à¸à¸¡à¸£à¸²à¸à¸à¸´à¹à¸§à¸¨à¸à¹à¸¡à¸«à¸²à¸ªà¸à¸²à¸ à¸­à¸¡à¸£à¸à¸´à¸¡à¸²à¸à¸­à¸§à¸à¸²à¸£à¸ªà¸à¸´à¸ à¸ªà¸±à¸à¸à¸°à¸à¸±à¸à¸à¸´à¸¢à¸°à¸§à¸´à¸©à¸à¸¸à¸à¸£à¸£à¸¡à¸à¸£à¸°à¸ªà¸´à¸à¸à¸´à¹) is listed as the world's longest location name by the Guinness Book of Records; an English rendering goes like this: "The city of angels, the great city, the residence of the Emerald Buddha, the impregnable city of Ayutthaya of God Indra, the grand capital of the world endowed with nine precious gems, the happy city, abounding in an enormous Royal Palace that resembles the heavenly abode where reigns the reincarnated god, a city given by Indra and built by Vishnukarn". The original village of Bangkok has long since ceased to exist, but foreigners never caught on to the change.
Life was taking place on the water; ordinary people lived on bamboo-rafts along the river, while floating vendors roamed the water to sell fruit and vegetables. The only stone structures built on land were temples and palaces. In the 19th-century, Western powers incorporated much of Southeast Asia into their colonial empires. King Rama IV and V felt that the only way to keep Siam independent was to modernise the country along European lines. Traditional canals were filled up and turned into roads. King Rama V moved the residence of the King to <a href="/en/Bangkok/Dusit" title="Bangkok/Dusit">Dusit</a> and laid out that district's grand boulevards along European lines.
Bangkok really started to develop after World War II. The economic centre shifted from the orderly planned city of Rattanakosin in an eastward direction, leaving Bangkok without an obvious centre. Bangkok established itself as the driving power behind Thailand's new role as a newly industrializing country from the 1980s onwards.
Rapid economic growth has attracted migration from the countryside, with millions of Thais moving here from <a href="/en/Isaan" title="Isaan">Isaan</a> to make a living.
This rapid expansion turned Bangkok into one of the most cosmopolitan and happening cities in Asia; but also ensured numerous problems. A wide gap has emerged between those who profit from economic activity, and those who came to the city from the countryside in search of work. Bangkok's seemingly never-ending traffic jams continue as the new Skytrain and metro systems are too expensive for the working class. Getting a break from the fumes in a park would seem to be a good idea, if it wasn't that Bangkok having the lowest amount of green space among all capitals in the world.
Addresses in Bangkok use the Thai addressing system, which may be a little confusing to the uninitiated. Large roads such as Silom or Sukhumvit are <b>thanon</b> (à¸à¸à¸), often abbreviated <i>Th</i> or glossed "Road", while the side streets branching off from them are called <b>soi</b> (à¸à¸­à¸¢). Sois are numbered, with even numbers on one side and odd numbers on the other side. Thus, an address like "25 Sukhumvit Soi 3" means house/building number 25 on the 3rd soi of Sukhumvit Road. While the soi numbers on each side will always advance upward, the numbers often do not advance evenly between sides â for example, Soi 55 could be across from Soi 36. Many well-known sois have an additional name, which can be used instead of the number. Sukhumvit Soi 3 is also known as "Soi Nana Nuea", so the address above might thus also be expressed as "25 Soi Nana Nuea". The extension /x is used for new streets created between existing streets, as seen in Sukhumvit's soi pattern 7, 7/1, 7/2, 9, 11. Note that some short alleys are called <b>trok</b> (à¸à¸£à¸­à¸) instead of soi.
To make things a little more complex, some large sois like Soi Ekkamai (Sukhumvit Soi 63) and Soi Ari (Phahonyothin Soi 7) have their own sois. In these cases, an address like "Ari Soi 3" means "the 3rd soi off Soi Ari", and you may even spot addresses like "68/2 Ekkamai Soi 4, Sukhumvit Road", meaning "2nd house beside house 68, in the 4th soi of Ekkamai, which is the 63rd soi of Sukhumvit". In many sois, the house numbers are not simply increasing, but may spread around.
To further bewilder the tourist who doesn't read Thai, the renderings of Thai street names in the Latin alphabet are not consistent. The road running towards Don Mueang Airport from Victory Monument may be spelled <i>Phahonyothin</i> or <i>Phahon Yothin</i> or <i>Pahon Yothin</i> or <i>Phaholyothin</i> depending on which street sign or map you consult. It's all the same in Thai, of course, only the romanisation varies.
And if that's not confusing enough, most of the larger streets tend to change names altogether every few kilometres. Sukhumvit is called <i>Sukhumvit</i> on one side of the tollway (roughly east), but it becomes <i>Phloen Chit</i> just before you cross Witthayu Road (aka <i>Wireless Road</i>) going towards the river. Keep going just a few more streets and it becomes <i>Rama I Road</i> (or <i>Phra Ram Neung Road</i>) after you pass Ratchadamri Road. But if you were to turn right onto Ratchadamri, in just a few blocks you'll find yourself on <i>Ratchaprarop Road</i> (past Phetchaburi, aka <i>New Phetburi</i>, which is called <i>Phitsanulok</i> closer to the river). Got it?
Fortunately, there's logic to these name changes: most of them are neighbourhoods. It wouldn't make sense to call the road <i>Sukhumvit</i> if it's no longer running through the Sukhumvit area, would it? Thus, Sukhumvit becomes <i>Phloen Chit</i> where it runs though the Phloen Chit area. It's when you're able to grasp the city in terms of its neighbourhoods that it both becomes more navigable and more charming. Likewise, Pratunam and Chatuchak are much more than just markets; they're neighbourhoods, each with their own distinct character.
Related to this last point, compass directions are not widely used by Thais to navigate in Bangkok. That's probably because they aren't very useful; the city's Darwinistic layout, the changing street names, the winding river, and the lack of obvious landmarks all conspire to confuse your internal compass. Thus, asking for directions in terms of "Is that west from here?" will probably earn you little more than a confused look from a local. You're better off to familiarise yourself with the neighbourhoods and navigate to and from them. "How do I get to Thong Lo?" will get you there faster than asking for directions to <i>Sukhumvit Soi 55</i>.
One exception: the Chao Phraya River is the landmark in Bangkok, and many directional references can be made as "toward the river" or "away from the river". If you aren't too close, that is: since the river winds around the most popular tourist areas, river references tend to be most helpful when you're wandering farther afield than Khao San Road, Sanam Luang or Rattanakosin. And wander you should.
According to the World Meteorological Organization, Bangkok is one of the hottest cities in the world. Located just 14 degrees north of the Equator, Bangkok is sunny at any time of the year with temperatures over 30Â°C (86Â°F).
The most pleasant time to visit is the <b>cool season</b> that lasts from November till February. It is both the coolest and driest period â the Emerald Buddha statue in <a href="/en/Bangkok/Rattanakosin#Grand_Palace" title="Bangkok/Rattanakosin">Wat Phra Kaew</a> even wears a scarf during this period! Don't think that's necessary though â daytime temperatures still hover around 30Â°C (86Â°F), but it does cool down into the lower 20's as it gets dark (lower 70's in Fahrenheit). March and April represent the <b>hot season</b>, and hot it is â 35Â°C (95Â°F) on average, but don't be surprised to see temperatures rising into the 40's Â°C (around 100Â°F+). This is the worst season to visit Bangkok, so plan in a lot of air-conditioned shopping mall visits and get a hotel with a swimming pool. Then there's the <b>wet season</b> that runs from May till October. Expect massive downpours resulting in floods all over the city, and spells of thunder at times. It's not all bad though â the afternoon showers are actually a pleasant way to cool down from the heat, and while they may last all day, usually they're over within an hour. Extreme rainfall happens in September and October, so these months are best avoided.
Whatever season you're visiting, don't take the weather lightly â temple-tramping in the scorching afternoon sun can be a challenge, so come well-prepared. <b>Dress lightly</b> for the weather, but keep in mind that some palaces and all temples (notably the <a href="/en/Bangkok/Rattanakosin#Grand_Palace" title="Bangkok/Rattanakosin">Grand Palace</a>) have a strict dress code. Also be sure, and this cannot be said enough, drink enough <b>fluids</b>! You don't have a reason not to, as 7-Elevens and other convenience stores are abundant in Bangkok and they sell cooled beverages for as little as 10 baht. Locals get their water from "reverse osmosis" purified water machines that fill up a one litre bottle for 1 baht.
Foreign films were popular in Thailand from the get-go, but in the 1920s a local film industry started to emerge in Bangkok. The most critically acclaimed Thai films were produced in the "three waves" of the Bangkokian film industry, the 1930s, the 1950s and the late 1990s/2000s, although films made before World War II have unfortunately been lost. Predominant genres are action, historical epics, romance and gay/transgender films, almost always intertwined with elements of comedy. The following are staged (at least partly) in Bangkok:
Bangkok is served by two airports: <b>Suvarnabhumi Airport</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://suvarnabhumiairport.com/">[1]</a> and <b>Don Muang Airport</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.donmuangairportonline.com/">[2]</a>. Suvarnabhumi Airport is used by all airlines in Thailand except for Nok Air, Orient Thai and Air Asia, which use the old Don Muang Airport. Both these airports are about 30&#160;km (19&#160;mi) from the city centre, so be prepared for a long ride to get into the city. Also allow <i>at least</i> three hours to connect between them, as they are far away from each other and there is heavy congestion on the roads.
Located 30&#160;km (19&#160;mi) to the east of Bangkok, space-age <b>Suvarnabhumi Airport</b> (à¸ªà¸¸à¸§à¸£à¸£à¸à¸ à¸¹à¸¡à¸´, pronounced "soo-wanna-poom") (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IATA" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:IATA">IATA</a>: <b>BKK</b>) (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICAO" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:ICAO">ICAO</a>: <b>VTBS</b>) started operations in Sep 2006 and is now Bangkok's main airport and the busiest airport in Southeast Asia. It is used for almost all international and domestic flights to Bangkok. There is only one terminal building, which covers both domestic and international flights, but it is <i>huge</i> (by some measures the world's largest), so allow time for getting around. There are two immigration sections, but processing time can be lengthy â 30 minutes and more.
Suvarnabhumi offers all facilities you would expect from a major international airport. There's a transit hotel, ATMs, money exchange, restaurants, tax-free shops, an observation lounge and even a "redemption booth", very reassuring for karmically challenged passengers. There are about 50 dining venues spread over the terminal building. The one that sounds most interesting probably is <b>Panda Ready To Eat</b>, but the cheapest place for a meal is <b>Magic Food Point</b> on level 1, near gate 8. There are a few stores in the check-in area, including a convenience store and a post office; however, the real shopping experience awaits travellers on the other side of immigration in the departure area, where the number of shops and duty free outlets leaves you wondering whether you are in an airport or a mall. There is not much to see at the observation deck on the seventh floor, since the steel structure of the roof blocks most of the view.
Stay away from airport duty free shops - particularly the King Power ones - as these operate scams involving spurious claims of shoplifting: heavy fines must be paid before you are allowed to board your flight. Several countries have issued consular warnings against these.
Also beware of airport convenience stores, which sell departing passengers food or drink in cans and bottles. All cans and bottles (even containing food) are then confiscated by security at check-in.
<b>Currency exchange</b> options are abundant, but virtually all offer an extremely poor exchange rate. A much better rate is normally available from the green booth K Excellence right by the entry to the City Line Train station.
<b>Free wi-fi</b> for up to one hour is available in the departure lounge, after security and passport control; the login details can be obtained from the Information point. Access can be frustratingly unstable and unreliable.
<b>More time than money?</b><br />
Thanks to the <b>Airport Rail Link</b>, <b>Hualamphong train station</b> can provide access to Suvarnabhumi Airport via exceedingly slow and frequently late 3rd class ordinary trains. Any train to or from Hualamphong on Thailand's Eastern Line (which runs to <a href="/en/Pattaya" title="Pattaya">Pattaya</a> or <a href="/en/Aranyaprathet" title="Aranyaprathet">Aranyaprathet</a>) will stop at <b>Lat Krabang</b> (1 hr, 6 Baht), which abuts Suvarnabhumi Airport. Lat Krabang conventional train station is directly below Lat Krabang airport link station, from where the journey to the airport can be completed for a further 15 Baht. If in a group, consider a taxi from Lat Krabang (about 50 Baht to the airport).
There are plenty of ways to get into the city from Suvarnabhumi Airport. Most people opt for the Airport Rail Link, by far the fastest way to get into downtown, although taxis are also reasonably priced by world standards.
Located on the basement level of the passenger terminal, the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.srtet.co.th/en/index.html">Airport Rail Link</a> offers a high-speed train service to downtown Bangkok. It's also a way of avoiding Bangkok's horrendous rush hour traffic, particularly when it's raining. Trains run 06:00-23:59 every day and travel at an amazing 160&#160;km/h (100&#160;mi/h). Two different services are operated:
If you're heading downtown, the Airport Rail Link has a good connection to the BTS Skytrain at Phaya Thai, though you will have to buy a new ticket. If Khao San Road is your final destination, you can hail taxis from the main road (around 60 baht, ~6km distance), or hop aboard bus <b>15</b> (7 baht); this bus leaves from across Central World, BTS Siam, and BTS National Stadium and goes along Ratchadamnoen Klang Road and Chakrabongse Road serving both sides of Khao San Road.
Private Airport Express buses, including backpacker favourite AE2 to <a href="/en/Bangkok/Khao_San_Road" title="Bangkok/Khao San Road">Khao San Road</a>, stopped running in Jun 2011. To take a <b>public bus or minibus</b>, you must first take the free shuttle bus from outside the second floor, gate 5 to the Public Transportation Center a few kilometres away. From there, The BMTA <b>public bus</b> lines are:
These services take about 1-2 hr depending on traffic; frequency is usually every 20 min during daytime. At nighttime, it ranges from 20 min-1 hr depending on the route. To give an example, the fare between Suvarnabhumi Airport and On Nut on 552 is 32 baht, and the journey takes about 40 min in mid-afternoon traffic. There are also privately-owned BMTA minibuses to many parts of Greater Bangkok, such as Don Muang Airport, Bang Kapi, Rangsit and Samut Prakan. They charge a flat rate of 50 baht and go directly to the destination, so they are faster than public buses that stop frequently along the way. To get to Khao San Road take Airport Rail Link City Line to Makkasan (35THB) and change there to bus number 556 (13THB), which will take you next to Democracy Monument from where it's a short walk to Khao San Road. These buses are not very frequent so prepare for as much as 30-40mins waiting time. This is probably the cheapest possible way how to get from/to airport for 48 baht total. (The 556 bus goes on from Democracy Monument to Southern Bus Terminal- Sai Tai.) Though you could take bus 554 to Synphaet Hospital and then public bus 60 or alternatively bus 555 to Din-Daeng Road followed by bus 171, both options will take you through heavy Bangkok traffic on normal roads with frequent stops, thus making the Airport Link the best and fastest option.
Long-distance first class bus services connect Suvarnabhumi Airport directly with <a href="/en/Chachoengsao" title="Chachoengsao">Chachoengsao</a>, <a href="/en/Nong_Khai" title="Nong Khai">Nong Khai</a>, <a href="/en/Pattaya" title="Pattaya">Pattaya</a>, <a href="/en/Rayong" title="Rayong">Rayong</a>, and <a href="/en/Trat" title="Trat">Trat</a>.
Ordinary <b>metered taxis</b> are available on the first floor (one floor below arrivals). Follow the "public taxi" signs that lead to the outside of the airport premises, queue up and state your destination at the desk (English is understood). You'll get a two-part slip with your destination written in Thai on it. The small part is for your driver, the large part is for you. This ticket is for complaints and is how the system is enforced: hold on to it to help avoid arguments later. There is a 50 baht surcharge on top of the meter (<i>not</i> per passenger!), meaning that trips to the city will cost 250-400 baht (plus possible expressway tolls of 45 and 25 baht, depending on time). Make sure you have change ready to pass to the toll operators to avoid being overcharged for the tolls later on. The ride takes about 45-60 minutes depending on traffic and location. No other surcharges apply, not even for going back to the airport. If there is a huge taxi queue, consider taking a limousine taxi, or take the free shuttle bus to the <b>Public Transport Center</b>, which has more taxis. Go straight to the "official taxi stand" and wait there. It is rare, but there have been reports of rigged meters that make the ride cost more than 400 baht. These taxis usually appear highly modified and it is a good idea to avoid them, or record the licence plate number of the taxi.
You should also watch out for 'helpful' touts hovering nearby the main taxi desk who will lead you across the road to legitimate taxis. These drivers will refuse to use the meter by saying there is heavy traffic and will charge a phenomenal price supposedly based on distance and number of passengers - for instance, they will quite brazenly tell you it will cost 2500 baht to take two people to the city centre. Refuse to deal with these touts on sight. However, should you make the mistake of trusting them, find out the fare before they have a chance to leave the airport. Quoting the correct metered price (250-400 baht, as above) will garner a response that you'll need to take a bus to get that kind of price. Stand your ground and insist they take you back to the airport - provided you do this before you leave, they'll be quite happy to take you back with no charge.
So-called <b>limousine taxis</b> (which charge by distance, e.g. around 800 baht to <a href="/en/Bangkok/Sukhumvit" title="Bangkok/Sukhumvit">Sukhumvit</a>) can be reserved at the limousine hire counter on the second floor (just outside arrivals), and aggressive <b>touts</b> will try to entice you on board. If you allow yourself to be waylaid by one of these taxi touts, they might quote you more than double the fare than an ordinary metered taxi would charge (900 baht instead of 400 baht, for example). You'd be silly even acknowledging their existence â ignore and walk straight past them.
There are free <b>shuttle buses</b> from Suvarnabhumi Airport to Don Muang Airport every hour between 05:00-23:00. Everyone can take these buses, you don't need a boarding pass. At Suvarnabhumi Airport, get on the bus at gate 2 or 3. At Don Muang Airport, get on the bus at the ground floor arrival terminal. The shuttle bus goes directly via the express way, and does not stop during the ride.
There are plenty of hotels near Suvarnabhumi Airport, and huge construction projects are planned for the future. Day room facilities for transit passengers are now available at the <b>Miracle Grand Louis Tavern</b> on floor 4, concourse G,  â +66 2 134-6565, 2,000 baht per 4-hour block, no reservations accepted. Travellers looking for a free quiet place to doze undisturbed at night can use one of the benches on the bottom floor of the terminal (which seem to be a popular choice with tourists and locals).
All other accommodation in Bangkok is listed in the relevant district articles. If you want an overnight stay within 20 min of the airport, get a hotel along Lat Krabang Road, here covered in the <a href="/en/Bangkok/Ramkhamhaeng" title="Bangkok/Ramkhamhaeng">Ramkhamhaeng</a> district. The Tourist Authority of Thailand and other hotel and tourist agencies have counters on the arrivals floor of the main terminal. You can make reservations at plenty of hotels here. Check for special promotions and also whether the hotel offers an airport pick-up and drop-off service â especially useful for late night arrivals and early morning departures.
<b>Don Muang Airport</b> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IATA" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:IATA">IATA</a>: <b>DMK</b>) (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICAO" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:ICAO">ICAO</a>: <b>VTBD</b>) (or <i>Don Mueang</i>), about 30&#160;km (19&#160;mi) north of downtown, was Bangkok's main airport until 2006. The airport currently handles <b>Nok Air</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://nokair.com">[3]</a> and <b>Orient Thai</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://fly12go.com">[4]</a> domestic flights, the international terminal is now used by <b>Air Asia</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.airasia.com">[5]</a>and charters. Since 1 Oct 2012 all Air Asia flights are bound for / leaving from DMK (Don Muang) instead of BKK (Suvarnabhumi). This might be something to consider when you have a connecting flight since most non-Air Asia international flights will be leaving from BKK (Suvarnabhumi).
The <b>public taxi stand</b> is on the pavement outside the arrivals area (don't be fooled by all the taxi service booths in the main hall), and is probably your best bet for getting into town â it's your only option after 23:00. A trip to MBK can cost roughly 250 baht depending on traffic. The same booth and slip system as at Suvarnabhumi Airport is used here. If the queue at the taxi stand is long or you need a more spacious car, you may want to book a (so-called) <b>limousine taxi</b> from the desks in the terminal. This will get you a slightly nicer car at about twice the price (500-600 baht). Ignore any touts outside and do not get into any car with white licence plates, as these are not licenced to carry passengers. If you are having trouble finding drivers willing to put the meter on, or want to avoid the airport taxis, you can walk to the main road outside by turning right outside the arrivals door and walking past the area where the buses are parked and make your way left towards the main road. You can hail down a taxi here, and the driver should put on the meter, this would be the cheapest fare.
Across a covered overpass from the airport is <b>Don Muang Train Station</b>. Tickets to Hualamphong Train Station in central Bangkok cost 8 baht at the ticket booth. While taking the train is the cheapest way to get from the airport to Bangkok, it is not for the faint-of-heart: schedules are erratic, the run-down passenger cars often have beggars roaming through them, and are relatively empty late at night. Still if you board the train at Don Muang, you immediately plunge from the shiny world of airports that are virtually the same everywhere into a very Thai Thailand, and during the day it makes an interesting journey. If you have been on third class Thai trains before, this one is no different. On every train station, vendors board the train to supply you with food and drinks. Thais will smile at you as they will do during the rest of your holiday, pleased to see a "farang" (a Thai word derived from "foreigner").
It is not advisable to try to get to the Don Muang airport by train when you have a flight to catch - trains run with very little regard for the scheduled timetable, and it is not uncommon to arrive more than an hour past the expected time. Add an extra hour or two to your journey time if you intend to get to the airport this way. Trains regularly depart late from the train station and its journey is hampered by the fact that the train sometimes gives way to traffic at some level crossings. [Expect for the train to be at a halt for up to fifteen minutes at some junctions (December 2012)]. Despite all this, if you have hours to kill, it is a highly recommended journey to take, especially if you are running low on Thai Bhat, as the journey is an amazing 8BHT (December 2012).
There is also a free shuttle bus service between DMK and BKK Suvarnabhumi airport. At peak times, it runs every 30 min and it takes about an hour, depending on traffic. The signs to the bus stop arenât that good but to get to it, all you have to do is turn left once you come out of the terminal building (with the taxi queue behind you) and walk towards the end of the building / pavement. If you have time to spare, this is a cheap way of getting into town from DMK since Suvarnabhumi offers many transport options.
There are two airport bus lines at DMK operated by BMTA (orange aircon bus). The ticket is 30 baht. You can take bus just in front of the terminal. It makes good connection to the BTS Skytrain and MRT subway
A1 to BTS Mo Chit/MRT Chatuchak and Mo Chit 2 Intercity Bus Terminal and return.
A2 (new) runs to BTS Mo Chit then Victory Monument and return.
There are also a number of public transport buses passing through the airport. Just follow the signs toward the bus stop. Airport to your back, the bus stop is on the right-hand side of the airport (ie north of the airport). It will be along the highway, outside the airport complex, right below a highway footbridge. Buses towards central Bangkok are at the airport's side of the road, so don't cross the highway. These are useful bus lines:
Keep in mind that some of these buses don't complete the route. They are called "additional bus" (Thai: à¸£à¸à¹à¸ªà¸£à¸´à¸¡ <i>rot serm</i>). These kind of buses have a red sign in front of them with the final destination written on it (in Thai script of course). Check this before taking the bus. You can ask the locals at the bus stop or a conductor on the bus.
Passengers have reported difficulty with using some of these buses due to the ecarcity of English-speaking conductors. Thus it is worthwhile to have your destination written town in Thai script and show it to the conductor, or even people at the bus stop, as this is a great help.
When buying tickets for buses out of Bangkok, it's best to skip travel agents and their private buses, and get the tickets for public buses directly at Bangkok's three <b>public bus terminals</b>. These buses are cheaper, safer, faster, more comfortable and won't scam you onto a clapped-out minibus halfway along the way or to a bedbug-infested hotel at the end. Each of these long haul bus terminals serve a different direction. They are purposefully located in off-central locations, so the long-haul buses avoid the heavy traffic congestion in the centre of the city.
The largest, busiest, and most modern terminal is the <b>Northern Bus Terminal</b>, â +66 2 936-2841(-3), also known as <b>Mo Chit</b>. The upper floor serves the <a href="/en/Isaan" title="Isaan">Isaan</a> region in the northeast of Thailand; the ground floor serves <a href="/en/Northern_Thailand" title="Northern Thailand">Northern Thailand</a>, and shares some destinations with Ekkamai (including <a href="/en/Pattaya" title="Pattaya">Pattaya</a>, <a href="/en/Rayong" title="Rayong">Rayong</a>, <a href="/en/Chanthaburi" title="Chanthaburi">Chanthaburi</a> and <a href="/en/Trat" title="Trat">Trat</a>). The bus terminal is a fair hike from BTS station Mo Chit or MRT station Chatuchak Park. Motorbike taxis do the trip for a fixed 30 baht fare (bargaining is pointless), while tuk-tuks charge whatever they feel like â when bargaining, remember that a real taxi with air-conditioning will cost you about 45 baht (assuming little traffic). You can also take bus <b>77</b> and pay the 13-baht flat fare on board (this bus also goes from the terminal via Victory Monument, Pratunam and Silom Road. If you have a considerable amount of luggage, the easiest, if not necessarily fastest, option is to take a taxi directly to or from the bus terminal.
Buying tickets here is reasonably easy; find a window with your destination written on it (in friendly Roman letters), pay the fare in big numbers on the same window, and you'll get a ticket on the next available departure. Note that blue writing means 1st class, red means 2nd class (avoid on longer trips), and tickets for destinations in Isaan are sold from the third floor. Ask the information desk on the first floor if you need help, or any of the BKS staff, easily identifiable thanks to their natty white shirts with gold buttons. Now just find the departure stall and you're on your way. If you have time to kill, there are two fairly decent air-conditioned food courts at both ends of the main terminal building, plus KFC, Dunkin' Donuts and lots of 7-Eleven outlets.
The <b>Eastern Bus Terminal</b>, â +66 2 391-2504, also known as <b>Ekkamai</b>, is a relatively compact terminal right next to Ekkamai BTS station in <a href="/en/Bangkok/Sukhumvit" title="Bangkok/Sukhumvit">Sukhumvit</a>. Ekkamai serves destinations in <a href="/en/Eastern_Thailand" title="Eastern Thailand">Eastern Thailand</a>, including <a href="/en/Pattaya" title="Pattaya">Pattaya</a>, <a href="/en/Rayong" title="Rayong">Rayong</a>, <a href="/en/Ban_Phe" title="Ban Phe">Ban Phe</a> (for <a href="/en/Ko_Samet" title="Ko Samet">Ko Samet</a>), <a href="/en/Chanthaburi" title="Chanthaburi">Chanthaburi</a> and <a href="/en/Trat" title="Trat">Trat</a>. If you're heading for <a href="/en/Ko_Chang" title="Ko Chang">Ko Chang</a>, there is a specifically designated stop for it between Chanthaburi and Trat. You can also get a bus to the Cambodian border crossing at <a href="/en/Poipet" title="Poipet">Poipet</a>, look for the bus to Aranyaprathet and tell them you are going to Poipet when you buy the ticket.
Then there's the <b>Southern Bus Terminal</b>, â +66 2 894-6122, also known as <b>Sai Tai</b>, that serves all destinations west and south of Bangkok from its somewhat inconvenient location on the <a href="/en/Bangkok/Thonburi" title="Bangkok/Thonburi">Thonburi</a> side of the river. In December 2007, the terminal moved to a new, even more remote location, at Phutthamonthon Sai 1 Road in northern Thonburi. Long-distance buses leave from here to destinations throughout <a href="/en/West_of_Bangkok" title="West of Bangkok">Western Thailand</a> (including <a href="/en/Nakhon_Pathom" title="Nakhon Pathom">Nakhon Pathom</a> and <a href="/en/Kanchanaburi" title="Kanchanaburi">Kanchanaburi</a>) and <a href="/en/Southern_Thailand" title="Southern Thailand">Southern Thailand</a> (including <a href="/en/Krabi" title="Krabi">Krabi</a>, <a href="/en/Phuket" title="Phuket">Phuket</a>, <a href="/en/Surat_Thani" title="Surat Thani">Surat Thani</a>, <a href="/en/Ko_Samui" title="Ko Samui">Ko Samui</a>, <a href="/en/Ko_Pha_Ngan" title="Ko Pha Ngan">Ko Pha Ngan</a>, <a href="/en/Hat_Yai" title="Hat Yai">Hat Yai</a>, and many others). The new terminal is a fairly pleasant airport-like structure with air-conditioning, electronic departure monitors (in English), a few bank offices, and a KFC. Unlike the rip-off operators at <a href="/en/Bangkok/Khao_San_Road" title="Bangkok/Khao San Road">Khao San Road</a>, all buses from here are public, well-regulated, cheap, and reasonably safe. Just buy your tickets at the numbered desk with your destination posted on it (almost always in English).
Getting to the terminal is a bit of headache, as public transport is limited. The easiest option is to take a metered taxi, but if you're going there in the evening, especially during workdays, be prepared to fight a serious traffic jam â getting there can take 30 minutes or a full hour from the city centre. A taxi ride from Khao San Road should end up around 120 baht in favourable traffic conditions. Ignore touts â unlike what they might say, there really is no "faster" way when all the roads are congested.
From Victory Monument BTS station, the terminal can be reached with pale orange air-conditioned bus <b>515</b> (17 baht). When approached by an onboard bus attendant ticketer, just say "Sai Tai". After quite a ride, the large bus terminal will be on the left side about 9 km (5.5 mi) after crossing the river (you won't miss it and probably will be told as well). Getting there by bus actually does not take much more time than taxi (it's almost the same in the likely case of a traffic jam), but the ride is much cheaper, especially if alone. Bus <b>556</b> no longer goes from Suvarnabhumi Airport, but from Makkasan Airport Rail Link (ARL) station. There are also white minibuses (30 baht) from various points around Bangkok, eg. from <a href="/en/Bangkok/Ramkhamhaeng" title="Bangkok/Ramkhamhaeng">Ramkhamhaeng</a> (near Rajamangala National Stadium). There are inexpensive shuttle buses and slightly more expensive (but quicker loading and a bit faster) minibuses to and from the Northern Bus Terminal as well.
From the Hualamphong station, one can take the <b>507</b> (15 baht) non-airconditioned bus.  It infrequently stops on the far side of the multi-road intersetion from the front of the rail station and goes directly to the terminal.  Allow for 60-90 minute to wait for the bus and for the long distance and the traffic.
From the Khao San Road/Democracy Monument area, you can take the orange <b>511</b> (15 baht). The New Southern Bus Terminal is the last stop on the route.
For travelling to Bangkok suburbs or locations within 200 km of the city, the fastest and often the cheapest way is to use public minibus (minivan) services. They are running from parking lots situated besides the Victory Monument square (facing the monument itself are the city bus stops, behind it there is a small market, and behind the market you will find many white-coloured minibuses just parking at the roadside and waiting for passengers). They depart when full, usually each 10-30 minutes. Fare is usually similar to long-distance buses with the same destination (if there are any). Other way, it could be estimated as 1 baht/km.
Some useful destinations:  <a href="/en/Ayutthaya" title="Ayutthaya">Ayutthaya</a> (around 70 baht), <a href="/en/Lopburi" title="Lopburi">Lopburi</a>, Nava Nakorn (50 baht, for Don Mueang airport or to get out along hwy 1 for hitching to the north/northeast), Minburi (around 30 baht, for Siam Park), Suvarnabhumi airport (40 baht), <a href="/en/Pattaya" title="Pattaya">Pattaya</a> (130 baht), <a href="/en/Rayong" title="Rayong">Rayong</a>, <a href="/en/Ban_Phe" title="Ban Phe">Ban Phe</a> (for <a href="/en/Ko_Samet" title="Ko Samet">Ko Samet</a>), <a href="/en/Chanthaburi" title="Chanthaburi">Chanthaburi</a>, <a href="/en/Kanchanaburi" title="Kanchanaburi">Kanchanaburi</a>, Phraram 2 (to the highway, for hitching to the southern Thailand), <a href="/en/Samut_Songkhram" title="Samut Songkhram">Samut Songkhram</a>, <a href="/en/Samut_Sakhon" title="Samut Sakhon">Samut Sakhon</a>, <a href="/en/Phetchaburi" title="Phetchaburi">Phetchaburi</a>, <a href="/en/Hua_Hin" title="Hua Hin">Hua Hin</a>, <a href="/en/Amphawa" title="Amphawa">Amphawa</a> (this route passes "railway market" in Maenam). Destinations are written in the front and side of minibuses in Thai, so you should ask drivers or ticket sellers about your destination. Minivans are usually the fastest way of transportation from the center, because they take elevated expressways right from Victory Monument, thus avoiding traffic jams. Another advantage is that they start from the center of Bangkok and usually arrive at the center of the destination, sometimes normal long distance buses would stop further away from the center.  Minibus drivers used to drive at very high speed, though in the beginning of 2012 there was a government campaign to enforce speed limits for them, after few major accidents happened. Significant disadvantage of minibuses is that seat room is limited and might be not comfortable for tall people.
The <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.railway.co.th/home/Default.asp?lenguage=Eng">State Railway of Thailand</a>, â +66 2 222-0175, serves Bangkok with railway lines from all four directions of Thailand. <b>Hualamphong Train Station</b> is the most important station, located close to <a href="/en/Bangkok/Yaowarat_and_Phahurat" title="Bangkok/Yaowarat and Phahurat">Yaowarat</a> and served by its own MRT station. It is a big and surprisingly convenient station built during the reign of King Rama VI. It was spared from bombing in World War II at the request of the Thai resistance movement.
Tickets for trains leaving the same or the next day can be bought on the counters under the big screens. The Advance Booking Office is located to the right of the platforms as you walk towards them and is quite well-organised. You can select your seat/berth from a plan of the train, and payments by credit card are accepted. You may be able to <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://thairailwayticket.com/">book an e-ticket</a>; however, the price is the same, the quota reserved for e-booking is limited, there are only first and second class air-conditioned sleeper tickets available and there are reports that this facility was disabled after 13 Jan 2013.
A word of advice is to only listen to the people at the information desk â anyone else walking around offering to help you "find" a hotel or taxi is just a tout, even if they are wearing official-looking badges. Likewise, the second floor shops offering "Tourist Information" are just agents in disguise. The taxi pick up and drop off point is to the left of the platforms as you walk towards them, and is generally chaotic at busy periods with scant regard for any queue. The left luggage facility is at the opposite end of the concourse, on the far right as you walk away from the platforms.
If coming by train from the north or north-east, connecting to the metro at <b>Bang Sue Train Station</b> can shave the last half-hour off your train trip. This is not a very good place to board trains though, as there is practically no information or signs in English. However, this situation will doubtlessly improve as more and more long-distance departures are switched to here from Hualamphong Train Station to ease congestion in the inner city.
The <b>Thonburi Train Station</b>, formerly known as the <b>Bangkok Noi Station</b>, is on the west side of the river in <a href="/en/Bangkok/Thonburi" title="Bangkok/Thonburi">Thonburi</a>. It is the terminus for twice-daily trains to <a href="/en/Kanchanaburi" title="Kanchanaburi">Kanchanaburi</a> (via <a href="/en/Nakhon_Pathom" title="Nakhon Pathom">Nakhon Pathom</a>). Just to keep things confusing, the previous Thonburi Train Station right next to the river (accessible by the Chao Phraya Express Boat pier <b>Railway Station</b>) is now mothballed and turned into a museum, but it's only 800&#160;m away from the new station. Note that the weekend-only second class air-conditioned "tourist" trains to Kanchanaburi and Nam Tok depart from Hualamphong Train Station.
<b>Wongwien Yai Train Station</b> only serves the rustic Mae Klong commuter line to the fishing village of <a href="/en/Samut_Sakhon" title="Samut Sakhon">Maha Chai</a>. Trains run roughly hourly and the trip takes about one hour. The ride is of little interest if you want to get there fast, but is an experience for rail fans and an attraction in itself, with a nice view on the countryside's orchards, vegetable plantations and coconut groves. Maha Chai is a nice seafood destination, and if you feel like it, you can cross the Tha Chin river by ferry and continue by rail to <a href="/en/Samut_Songkhram" title="Samut Songkhram">Samut Songkhram</a>. Wongwien Yai Train Station is about 800 m from the Skytrain station of the same name; to get there, take a metered taxi for 35-50 baht, or walk (using a map).
Not many people come to Bangkok by boat, but there are some cruise ships that attend the city. Large ships must dock at <b>Laem Chabang Port</b>, about 90 minutes southeast of Bangkok and about 30 minutes north of <a href="/en/Pattaya" title="Pattaya">Pattaya</a>.
It is possible to pre-book a taxi online to save costs â 1,490 baht for a sedan charter to Bangkok (4 passengers). A taxi service desk is also available on the wharf, but charges extortionate prices for a trip to Bangkok â a whopping 2,600 baht to charter a taxi (4 passengers), or about 5,000 baht to charter a minibus (usually 11 passenger seats). Slightly lower prices can be found by walking out to the main road, about 4,000 baht for a minibus, but even these rates are still almost double the typical rate in the opposite direction. Better deals may be possible for round trips (even if returning the following day).
Frequent first and second class bus services directly connect Laem Chabang with Bangkok's Eastern Bus Terminal (Ekkamai); less frequent direct services run to the Northern Bus Terminal (Mo Chit). A first class air-conditioned bus (blue and white) to either will take 90 minutes or less; the fare is around 100 baht. A quick way to get into downtown is to board an Ekkamai-bound bus and then disembark early at On Nut, where you can hop onto the Skytrain. The bus will always stop here if a passenger requests it.
Southbound buses en route to <a href="/en/Pattaya" title="Pattaya">Pattaya</a> can be boarded at the traffic lights on Sukhumvit Road in Laem Chabang. These are extremely frequent (at least 10 per hour), and charge less than 50 baht.
Modest-sized ships may dock further upriver at <b>Khlong Toei Port</b>, close to Bangkok's city centre. A modest terminal provides processing for passengers (who may receive Thai customs and immigration processing on-board), as well as offering "managers" who arrange tours and taxis. Reaching major hotels and other points of interest is much cheaper than from Laem Chabang, but can vary according to the passenger's negotiating skills. The facility is not close to the MRT stop of Khlong Toei, the best way to get there is by metered taxi.
Getting into Bangkok by car is not a good idea, as you can easily waste half a day waiting in traffic just to get to the other side of the city. Three major highways lead to Bangkok from all directions of Thailand. The best way to get to Bangkok from <a href="/en/Northern_Thailand" title="Northern Thailand">Northern Thailand</a> is driving on <b>Phahonyothin Road</b> (Route 1), which comes from <a href="/en/Mae_Sai" title="Mae Sai">Mae Sai</a> near the Myanmarese border. <b>Sukhumvit Road</b> (Route 3) comes from cities in <a href="/en/Eastern_Thailand" title="Eastern Thailand">Eastern Thailand</a>, such as <a href="/en/Trat" title="Trat">Trat</a>, <a href="/en/Pattaya" title="Pattaya">Pattaya</a> and <a href="/en/Chonburi" title="Chonburi">Chonburi</a>. <b>Phetkasem Road</b> (Route 4) must be one of the longest roads in the world, as it comes all the way from the Malaysian border serving <a href="/en/Southern_Thailand" title="Southern Thailand">Southern Thailand</a>.
To ease congestion on these highways, a new system of motorways has emerged which will be extended in the future. The <b>New Bangkok-Chonburi Motorway</b> (Motorway 7) is covering the trip from <a href="/en/Chonburi" title="Chonburi">Chonburi</a> and <a href="/en/Pattaya" title="Pattaya">Pattaya</a>. Then there's the <b>Kanchanaphisek National Highway</b> (Motorway 9 or "Outer Ring Road") which makes a giant loop around Bangkok serving most satellite towns around it, such as <a href="/en/Nonthaburi" title="Nonthaburi">Nonthaburi</a> and <a href="/en/Samut_Prakan" title="Samut Prakan">Samut Prakan</a>.
<br />
The first phase of Bangkok's ambitious public transport system is now complete, the city's public transport system is fairly efficient and convenient, but there is still a fair amount of room for improvement to the system's integration.
The city, like many developing cities, suffers from paralytic traffic jams periodically throughout the day. In rush hours, it may be worthwhile combining public transport by different means. For example: soar over traffic jams by skytrain to the station closest to your destination and thereafter take a taxi for the final leg.
The <b>BTS Skytrain</b> (à¸£à¸à¹à¸à¸à¹à¸²à¸à¸µà¸à¸µà¹à¸­à¸ª <i>rot fai fa BTS</i>, pronounced <i>bee-tee-et</i>) <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.bts.co.th/en/index.asp">[6]</a> deserves a visit simply for the Disneyland space-ageness of it. Built in a desperate effort to ease Bangkok's insane traffic and pollution, the Skytrain covers most of downtown and is especially convenient for visiting <a href="/en/Bangkok/Siam_Square" title="Bangkok/Siam Square">Siam Square</a>. There are two lines: the light green <b>Sukhumvit Line</b> travels along <a href="/en/Bangkok/Sukhumvit" title="Bangkok/Sukhumvit">Sukhumvit Road</a>, <a href="/en/Bangkok/Siam_Square" title="Bangkok/Siam Square">Siam Square</a> and then follows <a href="/en/Bangkok/Phahonyothin" title="Bangkok/Phahonyothin">Phahonyothin Road</a> up north, where it terminates at <b>Mo Chit</b> (N8), near the Chatuchak Weekend Market. The dark green <b>Silom Line</b> starts in <a href="/en/Bangkok/Thonburi" title="Bangkok/Thonburi">Thonburi</a>, passes the Express Boat pier at <b>Saphan Taksin</b> (S6), goes through the <a href="/en/Bangkok/Silom" title="Bangkok/Silom">Silom</a> area and ends at <b>National Stadium</b> (W1), right next to MBK Center. Both lines come together at <b>Siam</b> (CEN), where you can interchange between them. Unfortunately, there is no station near <a href="/en/Bangkok/Khao_San_Road" title="Bangkok/Khao San Road">Khao San Road</a>, but you can take the Express Boat from Phra Arthit Pier to Sathorn Pier, where you can switch onto the Skytrain.
You must have 5 or 10 baht coins to purchase Skytrain tickets from vending machines, so hold on to them. At most stations there is a single touchscreen machine that will accept 20, 50 and 100 baht notes, but there is often a queue to use it. Some stations have ticket counters which will change your large bills so you can purchase tickets from the vending machines. Fares range from 15 to 52 baht depending upon how many zones you are travelling. Consult the map (in English) near each ticket machine. If you do not have coins, queue for change from the staff at the booth. If you are in town for several days (or going to make several visits during the next 30 days), weigh your options and consider a rechargeable stored-value card (from 100 baht, with a 30 baht refundable deposit and a 30 baht non-refundable card cost), a "ride all you like" tourist pass (130 baht per day - <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.bts.co.th/customer/en/01-ticketing-type-one-day-pass.aspx">[7]</a>) or a multiple ride pass of 20 trips or more to any zone (15 trips cost 345 baht, 25 trips cost 550 baht; plus a 30 baht refundable deposit for a rechargeable card that is valid for 5 years). They will certainly save you time, scrambling for coins, and maybe even money. Check for information with the English speaking staff.
The Silom line is being extended westwards. As of 14 February 2013 it is operational as far as Talat Phlu (S10) but you will need to change at Wongwian Yai (S8) to catch the shuttle train that runs between those three stations (S8,S9,S10).
The <b>MRT</b> (à¸£à¸à¹à¸à¸à¹à¸²à¸¡à¸«à¸²à¸à¸à¸£ <i>rot fai tai din</i>, pronounced <i>em-ar-tee</i>) <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.bangkokmetro.co.th/">[8]</a> finally opened in July 2004. For now there is only one line, the <b>Blue Line</b> that connects the central <b>Hualamphong Train Station</b> (1) to the northern <b>Bang Sue Train Station</b> (18), running through <a href="/en/Bangkok/Silom" title="Bangkok/Silom">Silom</a>, <a href="/en/Bangkok/Sukhumvit" title="Bangkok/Sukhumvit">Sukhumvit</a>, <a href="/en/Bangkok/Ratchadaphisek" title="Bangkok/Ratchadaphisek">Ratchadaphisek</a> and area around Chatuchak Weekend Market in <a href="/en/Bangkok/Phahonyothin" title="Bangkok/Phahonyothin">Phahonyothin</a>. There are interchanges to the Skytrain at <b>Si Lom</b> (3), <b>Sukhumvit</b> (7) and <b>Chatuchak Park</b> (16) stations.
Tourists do not use the metro as much as the Skytrain, but there are some useful stops. The terminus at <b>Hua Lamphong</b> (1) provides a good access to <a href="/en/Bangkok/Yaowarat_and_Phahurat" title="Bangkok/Yaowarat and Phahurat">Yaowarat</a>. If you're going to the <b>Chatuchak Weekend Market</b>, don't get out at Chatuchak Park, but go one stop further to <b>Kamphaeng Phet</b> (17) as it drops you right inside the market.
Metro tickets are not interchangeable with Skytrain tickets. Rides start from 16 baht and are based on distance; pre-paid cards of up to 1,000 baht are also available. For single ride fares, a round plastic token is used. It is electronic: simply wave it by the scanner to enter; deposit it in a slot by the exit gate leave.
Note that bag-checks take place at the entrance of each station. It is usually nothing more than a quick peek inside, unless you are looking particularly suspicious.
Finally opened in August 2010, Bangkok's newest public transportation system is the <b>Airport Rail Link</b> (à¸£à¸à¹à¸à¸à¹à¸²à¹à¸à¸·à¹à¸­à¸¡à¸à¹à¸²à¸­à¸²à¸à¸²à¸¨à¸¢à¸²à¸à¸ªà¸¸à¸§à¸£à¸£à¸à¸ à¸¹à¸¡à¸´) <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://airportraillink.railway.co.th/en/">[9]</a>. The <b>Express Line</b> is only useful for getting into the city, as it starts at the airport, skips all stations and brings you directly to either <b>Makkasan</b> or <b>Phaya Thai</b>. This ride takes about 15 minutes and costs 190 baht.
If you want to use it to get around the city, take the <b>City Line</b> as it is cheaper and it stops at all stations. Many Thais in Eastern Bangkok use the link to commute to the city centre. It starts at Suvarnabhumi Airport and terminates at <b>Phaya Thai</b>, with some interesting stops in between (such as <a href="/en/Bangkok/Ramkhamhaeng" title="Bangkok/Ramkhamhaeng">Ramkhamhaeng</a> and <b>Ratchaprarop</b> for <a href="/en/Bangkok/Pratunam" title="Bangkok/Pratunam">Pratunam</a>). A ride costs 15-45 baht, depending on distance. Trains run every 15 minutes from 06:00-00:00.
From Makkasan, you can continue your way by metro at Phetchaburi MRT station. The transfer can be made via the pedestrian bridge which was opened as of June 2013. From Phaya Thai, you can transfer onto the Skytrain, but be aware that there are not enough lifts yet, and those available are too small for large pieces of luggage. New lifts will be installed in Ramkhamhaeng, Ratchaprarop and Phaya Thai stations in the following months.
The Bangkok BRT is a bus rapid transit system in Bangkok, Thailand. The 16 kilometres (9.9 mi) route has twelve stations in the centre of the road that give at grade access to the right hand side of the buses. The first route from Sathon to Ratchaphruek via Narathiwat Ratchanakharin and Rama III roads, opened to the public on 29 May 2010. Both termini connect to the Silom Line of the BTS Skytrain; at Chong Nonsi (S3) and at Talat Phlu (S10).
The <b>Light Red Line</b> (à¸£à¸à¹à¸à¸à¹à¸²à¸à¸²à¸à¹à¸¡à¸·à¸­à¸à¸ªà¸²à¸¢à¸ªà¸µà¹à¸à¸à¸­à¹à¸­à¸) is part of the planned Red Line suburban railway system to serve the Bangkok Metropolitan Region. The segment from Taling Chan to Bang Son (15 km) opened for limited, free trial service on December 5, 2012. Only 6 services a day currently operate on this line. The final section to Bang Sue station of this first phase will not open until the new Bang Sue Terminal is constructed.
<br />
A ride on the <b>Chao Phraya River</b> should be high on any tourist's agenda. The cheapest and most popular option is the <b>Chao Phraya Express Boat</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.chaophrayaexpressboat.com/en/home/">[10]</a>, basically an aquatic bus plying up and down the river. The basic service plies from <b>Wat Rajsingkorn</b> (S4) all the way north to <a href="/en/Nonthaburi" title="Nonthaburi">Nonthaburi</a> (N30), with stops at most of <a href="/en/Bangkok/Rattanakosin" title="Bangkok/Rattanakosin">Rattanakosin</a>'s major attractions including the Grand Palace (at <b>Tha Chang</b>) and Wat Pho (at <b>Tha Tien</b>). The closest pier to <a href="/en/Bangkok/Khao_San_Road" title="Bangkok/Khao San Road">Khao San Road</a> is <b>Phra Arthit</b>. Enter the express boat at the numerous piers and pay for the trip at ticket collector, who will approach you bearing a long metal cylinder. At some bigger piers you can buy the ticket before boarding. When the metal cylinder lady approaches you, just show her the ticket you bought on the pier.
The different boat lines are indicated by the colours of the flags at the top of the boat. These flags can be confusing; don't think the yellow King's flag corresponds to the yellow line flag! There is a basic "no flag" line (9, 11 or 13 baht) that goes along all the piers, but it only runs during rush hours (M-F 06:20-8:05 and 15:00-17:30) and is fairly slow. It is better to take the faster yellow (19 or 28 baht, M-F 06:15-08:10 and 15:30-18:05) and orange (15 baht, every day 06:00-19:00) flag lines, but you have to be sure where you're going as they don't stop everywhere. The yellow line is the fastest, but is best avoided as it skips many popular attractions (including Khao San Road, the Grand Palace and Wat Pho). The orange line is your best bet, as it covers the major tourist areas and is fairly quick too.
In addition to the workaday express boat, there is also a blue flagged <b>Tourist Boat</b> which stops at a different subset of piers, offers commentary in English and charges a flat 150 baht for a day pass. Single ride tickets are 40 baht. The boats are slightly more comfortable and may be worth considering if you want to cruise up and down the most important tourist sights. They only operate once per 30 minutes and stop running by 15:00.  Be careful as they may tell you the (cheaper) orange flag regular boat is not coming for quite a while (as they are aggressively touting for business), but sometimes this is not the truth. If you want the tourist experience with guide and (very) loud speaker commentary, often unintelligible, then this is the one for you.  However, be aware that you are fully entitled to enter the public piers (the ones with the blue lettering on white background with pier numbers on them) and get the orange flag boat as these are public places and you don't need a ticket before boarding the comfortable and speedy orange-flag boat.
The signposting of the piers is quite clear, with numbered piers and English route maps. <b>Sathorn (Taksin)</b> pier has been dubbed "Central" station, as it offers an quick interchange to Saphan Taksin BTS station. The boats run every 5-20 minutes from sunrise to sunset (roughly from 06:00-19:00), so ignore any river taxi touts who try to convince you otherwise.
Many piers are also served by cross-river ferries. These are particularly useful for reaching <b>Wat Arun</b> or the many piers at the <a href="/en/Bangkok/Thonburi" title="Bangkok/Thonburi">Thonburi</a> side of the river. Cross-river ferries run around every 10 minutes and only cost 3 baht â pay at the kiosk on the pier and then walk through the turnstile.
<br />
The <b>Saen Saep Express Boat</b> serves the long Saen Saep Canal, one of the remaining canals (<i>khlong</i>) that used to flow through Bangkok. Mostly used by locals to commute to work, the service is cheap and you get to see the 'backside' of the neighbourhoods, so to speak. Also, It is immune to Bangkok's notorious traffic jams. The total distance is 18 km (11 mi), and the service operates from 05:30-20:30.
They are comparatively safe â just watch your step when boarding and disembarking as they don't stop at the pier for long and do not let the dirty water get into your eyes. To prevent splashes, the boats are equipped with little curtains that you can raise by pulling on a string, but they have to be lowered at every stop so people can clamber on board. It's better to sit closer to the front of the boat further away from the engine which can be quite loud. Pay the fare (10-20 baht) to the fearless helmet-wearing ticket collectors who clamber around on the outside of the boat, ducking at bridges, as it barrels down the canal. Press the green 'bell' button if you want to get off at the next pier, else the boat might just skip it. The piers now even have (tiny) signs in English, with the exception of <b>The Mall Bangkapi</b> pier, and it's not obvious that you're at the mall from the canal boat!
The canal runs parallel to Phetchaburi Road, and provides the easiest access from the Golden Mount in <a href="/en/Bangkok/Rattanakosin" title="Bangkok/Rattanakosin">Rattanakosin</a> (and nearby <a href="/en/Bangkok/Khao_San_Road" title="Bangkok/Khao San Road">Khao San Road</a>) to <a href="/en/Bangkok/Siam_Square" title="Bangkok/Siam Square">Siam Square</a> and <a href="/en/Bangkok/Pratunam" title="Bangkok/Pratunam">Pratunam</a>. This line is aptly called the <b>Golden Mount Line</b> and runs from <b>Panfa Leelard</b> pier to <b>Pratunam</b> pier in downtown. If you want to continue your journey beyond Pratunam, passengers have to change boats there. The <b>NIDA Line</b> starts at Pratunam and heads east to <a href="/en/Bangkok/Sukhumvit" title="Bangkok/Sukhumvit">Sukhumvit</a> and <a href="/en/Bangkok/Ramkhamhaeng" title="Bangkok/Ramkhamhaeng">Ramkhamhaeng</a>. Hold on to your ticket.
Finally, for trips outside set routes, you can hire a <b>long-tail river taxi</b> at any major pier. These are fairly expensive and will attempt to charge as much as 500 baht/hr but is mostly for foreigners, but with some <a href="/en/Haggling" title="Haggling" class="mw-redirect">haggling</a> they may be suitable for small groups. To circumvent the mafia-like touts who attempt to get a large cut for every ride, agree for the price of the shortest possible ride (30 min), then negotiate directly with the captain when on board.
<b>Metered taxis</b> are a quick and comfortable way to get around town, at least if the traffic is flowing your way, but be warned that Bangkok taxi drivers are notorious for finding ways to run up the fare for foreigners; insist that the meter is used, and if the driver claims that your destination is closed, that he doesn't know where it is, or if he tries to take you elsewhere, just get out of the taxi. All taxis are now metered and air-conditioned: the hailing fee is 35 baht and most trips within downtown cost less than 100 baht. There are no surcharges (except from the airport), even at night; don't believe drivers who try to tell you otherwise. A red sign on the front window, if lit, means that the taxi is available.
When the meter is switched on you will see a red '35' somewhere on the dashboard or between the driver and you. Be sure to check for this at the start of the ride, as many drivers will "forget" to start the meter in order to overcharge you at the end of your trip. Most will start the meter when asked politely to do so (<i>meter na khrap</i> if you're male and <i>meter na kha</i> if you're female); if the driver refuses to use the meter after a couple of attempts, simply exit the taxi.
In some cases, late at night and especially near major tourist districts like Khao San or Patpong, you will need to walk a block away to catch a honest driver. The effort can save you as much as 150 baht. This is often also the case for taxis that park all day in front of your hotel. There are only two reasons that they are there: to take you places where they can get their commissions (jewellery stores, tailors, massage parlours, etc.) and to overcharge you by not using the meter.
Your best bet is to walk to the road and catch an unoccupied metered taxi in motion (easier than it sounds, as Bangkok traffic tends to crawl the majority of the time, and one car out of four is a taxi). Avoid parked taxis altogether, and if a taxi driver refuses to turn the meter on, simply close the door and find one who will. Keep in mind that it is illegal for them to have unmetered fares. Be smart and give your money to honest drivers, not touts. The only reason that they get away with this so frequently is that foreign tourists let them.
Be sure to either know the correct pronunciation of your destination, or have it written in Thai, as taxi drivers in Bangkok are notoriously bad at reading maps, and most drivers speak limited English. Most hotels and guest houses will happily write out addresses in Thai for you. While most drivers will recognise the names of tourist hot spots, even if grossly mispronounced, but it is often difficult to properly pronounce addresses in Thai. If your mobile phone works in Thailand, it is sometimes useful to call your hotel and ask the staff to speak to your driver in Thai. In addition, try to get your hotel's business card to show the taxi driver in case you get lost.
If you are pinching pennies or fussy about your means of transportation, you may wish to avoid getting into one of the (very common) yellow-green taxis. They are owner-operated and of highly variable quality and occasionally have rigged meters. All other colours belong to large taxi companies, which usually enforce their standards better.
On some routes, the driver will ask if he should use the <i>tollway</i> â this will usually save a lot of time. You have to pay the cost at the toll booth (not in advance and not at the end of the journey). Watch how much the driver really pays, as many try to keep the change.
When getting out, try to have small bills (100 baht or less) or expect problems with change. Tips are not necessary, but are certainly welcome if you're happy about the service; most local passengers will round up or leave any coin change as tip.
Finally, what would Bangkok be without the much-loathed, much-loved <b>tuk-tuks</b>? You'll know them when you hear them, and you'll hate them when you smell them â these three-wheeled contraptions blaze around Bangkok leaving a black cloud of smog in their wake. For anything more than a 5-10 min jaunt or just the experience, they really are not worth the price but it can still be enjoyable for people that come to Thailand â and, if you let them get away with it, the price will usually be 4 or 5 times what it should be anyway (which, for Thais, is around 30% less than the equivalent metered taxi fare).
On the other hand, you can sometimes ride for free if you agree to visit touristy clothing or jewellery shops (which give the tuk-tuk driver fuel coupons and commissions for bringing customers). The shops' salesmen are pushy, and try to scam you with bad quality suits or "gems" that in fact are worthless pieces of cut glass. But usually you are free to leave after 5-10 min of browsing. Visitors should beware though, sometimes one stop can turn in to three, and your tuk-tuk driver may not be interested in taking you where you need to go once he has his fuel coupons. Also, with Bangkok's densely congested traffic it is sure to waste hours of your time, if not the whole day.
If you still want to try the tuk-tuk, always hail a moving tuk-tuk from the main road. At tourist spots, these tuk-tuk drivers lie in waiting to disrupt your travels plans. Always <b>agree on a price</b> before entering the tuk-tuk. Also be crystal clear about your intended destination. If they claim that your intended destination is closed for the day, and offer to take you to other nearby tourist spots, insist on your destination or get out. If you're an all-male party, tuk-tuk drivers sometimes will just ignore your destination completely and start driving you to some brothel ("beautiful girls"). Insist continually and forcefully on going only to your destination; or take a metered taxi instead.
A <b>songthaew</b> is a less-heralded, less-colourful and less-touristy version of the tuk-tuk that usually serves the back sois in residential neighbourhoods. They usually have four wheels instead of three, two benches instead of one, run on petrol instead of LPG and resemble a tiny truck. The maids and locals tend to use them to return home from the market with loads of groceries, or for quick trips if they're available. Negotiate before you get in, but don't expect to go much beyond the edge of that particular neighbourhood.
When traffic slows to a crawl and there are no mass-transit alternatives for your destination, by far the fastest mode of transport is a <b>motorbike taxi</b> (à¸¡à¸­à¹à¸à¸­à¸£à¹à¹à¸à¸à¹à¸£à¸±à¸à¸à¹à¸²à¸ <i>motosai lapjang</i>). No, those guys in the pink smocks aren't biker gangs; they're motosai cabbies. They typically wear colourful fluorescent yellow-orange or red vests and wait for passengers at busy places. Prices are negotiable before you ride but is the best way when the traffic is not floating well as usually in Bangkok.
For the adrenaline junkie,  a wild motosai ride can provide a fantastic rush. Imagine weaving through rows of stopped vehicles at 50 km/h (30 mi/h) with mere centimetres to spare on each side, dodging pedestrians, other motorbikes, tuk-tuks, stray dogs and the occasional elephant while the driver blithely ignores all traffic laws and even some laws of physics. Now do the same while facing backwards on the bike and balancing a large television on your lap, and then you can qualify as a local â though you might die in the process. Imagine your loved ones arranging to ship your dead body home from Bangkok because you took a dangerous risk you were warned not to. <b>Motorcycle accidents are brutally common, and transportation of this sort is inherently hazardous</b>. Be aware of the risk before using motorcycle taxis. Many tourists and Thai alike recommend avoiding them except as a last resort. Under no circumstances ride without a helmet.
The overwhelming majority of motorcycle taxis do not travel long distances, but simply shuttle up and down long sois (side-streets) not serviced by other transport for a fixed 5-20 baht fare. These are marginally less dangerous, especially if you happen to travel with the flow on a one-way street.
The law requires that both driver and passenger must wear a helmet. It is the driver's responsibility to provide you with one, so if you are stopped by police, any fine is also the driver's responsibility. This is worth bearing in mind when you hire a motorbike or moped. Make sure that if there are two of you, the hirer provides two helmets instead of one. When riding, keep a firm grasp on the seat handle and watch out for your knees.
<b>Local buses</b>, operated by the <b>Bangkok Mass Transit Authority</b> (à¸­à¸à¸à¹à¸à¸²à¸£à¸à¸à¸ªà¹à¸à¸¡à¸§à¸¥à¸à¸à¸à¸£à¸¸à¸à¹à¸à¸) <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.bmta.co.th/en/index.php">[11]</a>, or just <b>BMTA</b> (à¸à¸ªà¸¡à¸), are the cheapest but also the most challenging way of getting around. There is a bewildering plethora of routes, usually marked only in Thai. Even Thais have a hard time with these, but at least they can call the <b>1384 Bus Route Hotline</b>, which is in Thai only. Bus stops list only the bus numbers that stop there and nothing more. They are also subject to Bangkok's notorious traffic, often terribly crowded, and many are not air-conditioned. If you want to get somewhere quickly and are not prepared to get lost, the buses should be avoided (remember that taxis are cheaper than most local buses in the West). However, they make for a good adventure if you're not in a rush and you don't mind being the centre of attention.
But for the intrepid, and those staying in <a href="/en/Bangkok/Khao_San_Road" title="Bangkok/Khao San Road">Khao San Road</a> where buses are the only practical means of public transport, the official resource for decrypting bus routes is the BMTA website. It has up-to-date if slightly incomplete listings of bus routes in English, but no maps. Another site in English which also features a route planner is <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.transitbangkok.com">Transit Bangkok</a>. You can also ask your guest house about which buses to take if you're going to a particular destination. As a printed reference, the 69 baht spent on the <i>Bangkok Bus Map</i> by Roadway is a good investment if you're going to travel by bus more than once.
The hierarchy of Bangkok's buses from cheapest to best can be ranked as follows:
Buses stop only when needed, so wave them down (arm out, palm down) when you see one barreling your way. Pay the roaming collector after you board and keep the ticket, as there can be occasional spot-checks. Press the signal buzzer (usually near the door) when you want to get off.
Two further pitfalls are that buses of the same number may run slightly different routes depending on the colour, and there are also express services (mostly indicated by yellow signs) that skip some stops and may take the expressway (2 baht extra).
Airport buses allow luggage (backpacks and suitcases), but regular buses do not. Enforcement of this rule varies.
Bangkok has good quality roads, but driving in the city can be a nightmare with massive traffic jams, a convoluted web of expressways and oft-confusing road signage. If driving, be especially aware of sudden lane changes by cars and reckless motorcyclists who tend to weave in and out of traffic. On busy roads you will often find vehicles moving slowly into the traffic from car parks and side streets, those already on the road are expected to give way.
Do not park on the road in busy districts such as Siam because other cars might lock you in by parking next to you in the 2nd or 3rd lane. Use covered car parks or park a bit off the beaten path, and then walk back. If using a car park and there are no marked bays available, you can park in front of other cars, but make sure you leave the car in neutral with the parking brake off so you can be rolled out of the way if required. Similarly, if you've parked in a marked bay and are blocked by another car, simply push it out of the way - carefully.
Renting a car is an option for travelling in Bangkok and other parts of Thailand. Always get the optional insurance - the basic rental charge usually doesn't have any insurance at all, and your travel insurance is only likely to cover an excess or deductible where there is some basic level of insurance. Check the policy carefully for exclusions, at least some policies exclude speeding and advise that this is monitored by GPS.
<b>Peoplespotting</b><br />
More than any other place in Thailand, Bangkok offers wonderful opportunities for just sitting and watching people go by. Here's a partial checklist:
Most of Bangkok's sights are concentrated on the island of <a href="/en/Bangkok/Rattanakosin" title="Bangkok/Rattanakosin">Rattanakosin</a>, often referred to as the "Old City". Out of Bangkok's hundreds of temples, the <b>Grand Palace</b>, <b>Wat Pho</b> and <b>Wat Arun</b> usually make up the top 3. The Grand Palace has an immense size, so expect to spend at least a full morning or afternoon there. Within the palace grounds is <b>Wat Phra Kaew</b>, the most sacred Buddhist temple of Thailand. Unlike other temples, it is not one building, nor are there living spaces for monks. Instead, it is a collection of highly decorated holy buildings and monuments. One of its buildings houses the <b>Emerald Buddha</b>, and while you might not expect it from its size, it is the most sacred Buddha image of Thailand.
Nearby is <b>Wat Pho</b>, home to the world's largest reclining Buddha image and a famed massage school. Take the ferry across the Chao Phraya River to <a href="/en/Bangkok/Thonburi" title="Bangkok/Thonburi">Thonburi</a> for the outstanding <b>Wat Arun</b>. The main structure is about 60 to 88 m high and it is surrounded by four smaller prangs. It is one of Thailand's most picturesque temples, and is engraved on the inner part of all ten baht coins. It is so recognisable that it even became the logo of the Tourist Authority of Thailand (TAT). If you climb it, and look closely, you will see that it is beautifully decorated with colourful broken Chinese porcelain pieces. Heading back to <a href="/en/Bangkok/Rattanakosin" title="Bangkok/Rattanakosin">Rattanakosin</a>, there are many other major temples you could visit, including the <b>Golden Mount</b>, <b>Wat Suthat</b> and <b>Wat Ratchanaddaram</b>.
Don't throw away the entry ticket of the Grand Palace, as it gives free entry to the <b>Dusit Palace</b> in <a href="/en/Bangkok/Dusit" title="Bangkok/Dusit">Dusit</a>. It is situated in a leafy, European-style area built by King Rama V to escape the heat of the Grand Palace. Its main structure is the <b>Vimanmek Mansion</b>, touted as the largest golden teakwood house in the world, but you could spend your whole day in the museums if you wish. There are many museums in Bangkok showing traditional Thai-style residences. Most visitors take a tour through <b>Jim Thompson's House</b>, the CIA-operative's mansion assembled by combining six traditional Thai-style houses, conveniently located near <a href="/en/Bangkok/Siam_Square" title="Bangkok/Siam Square">Siam Square</a>. <b>Ban Kamthieng</b> in <a href="/en/Bangkok/Sukhumvit" title="Bangkok/Sukhumvit">Sukhumvit</a>, <b>M.R. Kukrit's Heritage Home</b> in <a href="/en/Bangkok/Silom" title="Bangkok/Silom">Silom</a> and the <b>Suan Pakkad Palace</b> in <a href="/en/Bangkok/Phahonyothin" title="Bangkok/Phahonyothin">Phahonyothin</a> are not quite as impressive, but still make for a nice experience. <a href="/en/Bangkok/Rattanakosin" title="Bangkok/Rattanakosin">Rattanakosin</a>'s museums are mostly dedicated to history and culture, including the <b>National Museum</b> (about Thai history and archaeological remains), the <b>Museum of Siam</b> and the <b>King Prajadhipok Museum</b>. Bangkok has a small, but vocal art community, and you might want to visit the <b>National Gallery</b> or <b>The Queen's Gallery</b>, or one of its numerous smaller galleries spread over the city. <a href="/en/Bangkok/Siam_Square" title="Bangkok/Siam Square">Siam Square</a> features the recently opened <b>Bangkok Art and Culture Centre</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.bacc.or.th/">[12]</a> which has temporary art exhibitions throughout year.
<b>Lumphini Park</b> in <a href="/en/Bangkok/Silom" title="Bangkok/Silom">Silom</a> is the largest park in central Bangkok, and a good way to escape the fumes. Backpackers around <a href="/en/Bangkok/Khao_San_Road" title="Bangkok/Khao San Road">Khao San Road</a> can head for <b>Santichaiprakarn Park</b>, a small but fun park along the Chao Phraya River with a breezy atmosphere, usually with locals juggling or practicing tricks. It is built around the 18th-century <b>Phra Sumen Fort</b> with a nice view on the modern Rama VIII cable-stayed bridge. Zoos and animal farms are some of the more popular tourist attractions in Bangkok, but before visiting, please be aware that animal welfare in Thailand is not strictly regulated. Poor living conditions of the animals and inadequate veterinary care are examples of the sad mistreatment of the animal population. You can't go wrong at the <b>Queen Saovabha Institute Snake Farm</b> in <a href="/en/Bangkok/Silom" title="Bangkok/Silom">Silom</a>, as the staff takes good care of their snakes and they have a job of informing the public about the risks associated with them. Another nice family attraction is <b>Siam Ocean World</b> in <a href="/en/Bangkok/Siam_Square" title="Bangkok/Siam Square">Siam Square</a>. It has a steep price tag, but at least you get to see the largest aquarium in Southeast Asia.
Go cycling! It may sound crazy, as cycling is deadly dangerous on the main roads, but it certainly is not if you know where to go. Away from the main roads there is a vast system of small streets and alleys. Cyclists are treated as pedestrians, so you can use your bicycle to explore parks, temple complexes, markets and the more quiet residential areas of eastern Bangkok. In more crowded places you can cycle on the pavement. Exploring the town by bicycle has all the advantages of going by foot, combined with a much greater action radius and a cooling breeze.
If you want to experience Bangkok hideaways and countryside, leisurely cycling through green paddy fields, colourful orchid farms, peaceful lotus fields and touched by the charm of Thai way of country life at personal level, bicycle is a great way to do it. There are a handful of specialist operators that offer daily or regular departures to the so-called "Bangkok jungle" (<i>Bang Kachao</i>), a semi-island across the river from Bangkok with few cars or buildings, or through the backstreets of <a href="/en/Bangkok/Yaowarat_and_Phahurat" title="Bangkok/Yaowarat and Phahurat">Chinatown</a>. It sounds strange but a cycle tour in Bangkok really is the best way to discover the city up close.
Project Bangkok Smile Bike subsidized by city which allowed free bike rental even without deposit just with photo of your passport has been cancelled and all stations dismantled, so don't look for it anymore, only way to rent bicycle in Bangkok is pay in rental shop.
Cycling is a popular option among tour companies, but there are a variety of running clubs in Bangkok that welcome visitors multiple times per week for running, socializing, eating and drinking throughout Bangkok and the surrounding areas.  These clubs are either free or charge a small, non-profit fee to pay for food and drink served at the event.
Running is a great way to see parts of the city and countryside that you'd never otherwise experience.  If you go with a social running club, it's also a great chance to meet interesting people, eat food you've never tried and to make new friends.  If you're interested in seeing countryside, out-of-the-way neighborhoods, plantations, jungle and other places you can only go on foot, you might be interested in these clubs:
Another great way to see the Chao Phraya River and the original canals of the city is by <b>canal tour</b>. Most of these special boat trips start at the eastern bank of the Chao Phraya and head through the backwaters of Thonburi, taking in Wat Arun, the Royal Barges National Museum and a floating market. More information about these canal tours can be found in the <a href="/en/Bangkok/Thonburi" title="Bangkok/Thonburi">Thonburi</a> article. At 1,000 baht or more, they are quite expensive though; a cheaper and also fun activity is to take the public express boat along the Chao Phraya River. You can get off anywhere between Thewet and Sathon (Taksin) piers as there are many things to see in all those neighbourhoods. You can even go all the way north to <a href="/en/Nonthaburi" title="Nonthaburi">Nonthaburi</a> in the morning, enjoy the afternoon in this laid-back traditional urban town and take the boat back around rush hour.
<b>Muay Thai</b>, informally known as <b>Thai Boxing</b>, is both a sport and a means of self-defence. Contestants are allowed to use almost any part of the body: feet, elbows, legs, knees, and shoulders. There are two venues in Bangkok to see this type of sport in action, <b>Lumpinee Boxing Stadium</b> in <a href="/en/Bangkok/Silom" title="Bangkok/Silom">Silom</a> and <b>Ratchadamnoen Stadium</b> in <a href="/en/Bangkok/Rattanakosin" title="Bangkok/Rattanakosin">Rattanakosin</a>. Sessions can take the whole evening, and the more interesting fights tend to happen in the end, so it's not that bad if you come slightly too late. The playing of traditional music during the bouts is enjoyable as well. A downer is the steep 1,000-2,000 baht entry fee for foreigners, while Thais chip in for 100 baht or less.
Muay Thai venue outside MBK Center every Wednesday (starts at 18:00, lasts until around 21:00), and it's free. However, it is cancelled due to rainy season until October 2013.
There are many cultural performances in Bangkok that shows traditional Thai culture and dance. <b>Siam Niramit</b> in <a href="/en/Bangkok/Ratchadaphisek" title="Bangkok/Ratchadaphisek">Ratchadaphisek</a> is a truly spectacular performance where more than 150 performers depict the history of each region of Thailand.
Of a completely different order are Bangkok's famous drag shows. These cabarets generally take about two hours, and besides singing, dancing, glamour and costumes, usually it also has some comedy thrown in. The most famous show is <b>Calypso Cabaret</b> in <a href="/en/Bangkok/Pratunam" title="Bangkok/Pratunam">Ratchathewi</a> that has two sessions every evening at the Asia Hotel. Always book these shows a couple of days in advance.
Bangkok, a city of astonishing contrasts, is a truly amazing city by any standard. The ancient blends with the modern and somehow the combination works in surprising and interesting ways. Likewise with your personal lifestyle, you can choose to get a massage â or learn Thai Massage â at a beautiful Buddhist temple, or you may prefer the modern alternative: an urban health oasis where you are pampered and treated with your choice of therapies or techniques.
The respected Travel &amp; Leisure Magazine Survey ranked Bangkok the worldâs #1 city in 2008 and 2010, and after spending some time there, youâll begin to understand why.  The city has so much to offer, the prices are very reasonable, the attractions plentiful and diverse, the shopping superb, and the healthcare simply outstanding. Itâs not difficult to find the perfect place to take good care of you, be it a first-rate hospital, a modern dental clinic, or a beautiful spa or wellness center. <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.thailandmedtourism.com/FileUpload/MultimediaFile/130909050113997.pdf">[24]</a>
Bangkok has scores of wonderful, popular, professional spas; some of the leading ones are Leyana Spa, Divana Spa, Mandara Spa, Spa de Bangkok, Devarana Spa â Dusit Thani Hotel, The Oasis Spa Bangkok, Banyan Tree Spa Bangkok, and the Spa Cenvaree - Centara Grand at Central World.
Spas, traditionally, were towns where public baths, hospitals or hotels were built on top of mineral springs so that people could come and make use of the healing properties found in the water and its mud for medical purposes. These days, a spa doesnât have to be a town built on natural thermal springs. It can be a place anywhere that anyone can go to, to relax in tranquil surroundings with a variety of treatment administered to recontour and rejuvenate the body and mind.
All self-respecting luxury hotels in Bangkok have a spa that at least offers a traditional Thai massage. Prices are exorbitant, but they offer some of the best treatments in Bangkok. Particularly well-regarded spas at exceptionally high rates are given at the splurge hotels in <a href="/en/Bangkok/Silom" title="Bangkok/Silom">Silom</a>. Independent spas offer much the same experience, but offer much more competitive rates. Figure around 2,000 baht/hr for most treatments at the hotel spas and around 1,000 baht/hr at the independent spas. However, it is worth researching before booking as prices can vary widely between establishments, and various promotions are often available. The best regarded hotel spas are at Mandarin Oriental, Plaza Athenee and The Eugenia. The best regarded independent spas are Oasis Spa, So Thai Spa and Divana Massage &amp; Spa.
The ubiquitous little <b>massage shops</b> found on every street corner in town offer the best value for money, but the smallest range of services, with offerings usually limited to massage only. Particularly <a href="/en/Bangkok/Khao_San_Road" title="Bangkok/Khao San Road">Khao San Road</a> and <a href="/en/Bangkok/Sukhumvit" title="Bangkok/Sukhumvit">Sukhumvit</a> have plenty of these popular places. It is fairly easy to distinguish legitimate massage shops from more dubious places (where massaging is only a front for prostitution); the real deal will charge 250-400 baht for a typical two-hour massage and will often have a row of beefy farmers' daughters in white coats working on customers' feet in public view, while the other kind has wispy girls in evening dresses wearing too much make-up and saying "hello handsome" to every passing male. The current going rate for a 1 hour massage on Khao San Road is 220 baht.
Bangkok is a great place to go to the <b>movies</b>. Compared to the West, the cost of a ticket is a complete bargain at around 120 baht. Most cinemas have world-class standards and show the latest Hollywood and Thai releases. Watching Thai movies is a fun night out, as pretty much all of them have English subtitles. They are up to par with the latest technological innovations in the film industry, so expect to wear 3D glasses for some of the latest Hollywood releases, or visit the IMAX Theatre in Siam Paragon.
For non-mainstream cinema, <b>House RCA</b> (in <a href="/en/Bangkok/Ratchadaphisek" title="Bangkok/Ratchadaphisek">Royal City Avenue</a>) and <b>APEX</b> (in <a href="/en/Bangkok/Siam_Square" title="Bangkok/Siam Square">Siam Square</a>) offer art films with English subtitles.
For other means of <b>entertainment</b>, <a href="/en/Bangkok/Ratchadaphisek" title="Bangkok/Ratchadaphisek">Ratchadaphisek</a> is a newly created entertainment paradise. Its <b>bowling centres</b> are of a superb standard with some of them resembling the inside of a nightclub. Dance while you play in style. Private karaoke lounges are usually connected to these bowling centres and are available at major hotels. There's even an ice skating rink and a top-class go-go kart track. As Ratchadaphisek is mostly aimed at the locals, you might want to go to similar venues in <a href="/en/Bangkok/Siam_Square" title="Bangkok/Siam Square">Siam Square</a> or <a href="/en/Bangkok/Sukhumvit" title="Bangkok/Sukhumvit">Sukhumvit</a>.
Musical, cabaret and theater entertainment by Thai performers can be found every night at The Playhouse Theater <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.playhousethailand.com">Playhouse Theater</a>] in the Asia Hotel which is connected to the Ratchathewi BTS station.
<b>Horse Races</b> are held on Sundays at two alternate turf clubs, the <b>Royal Turf Club of Thailand</b> in <a href="/en/Bangkok/Dusit" title="Bangkok/Dusit">Dusit</a> and the <b>Royal Bangkok Sports Club</b> on Henri Dunant Road (near <a href="/en/Bangkok/Siam_Square" title="Bangkok/Siam Square">Siam Square</a>).
All of Thailand's major festivals are celebrated in Bangkok.
Thai cuisine is a favourite of many, and plenty of <b>cooking schools</b> provide half-day classes that provide a nice break from the day-to-day sightseeing monotony. <a href="/en/Bangkok/Silom" title="Bangkok/Silom">Silom</a> and <a href="/en/Bangkok/Khao_San_Road" title="Bangkok/Khao San Road">Khao San Road</a> particularly have some of the better-known Thai cooking schools.
<b>Meditation</b>, the essence of 'pure' Buddhism, can be practised at any temple in Thailand. In Bangkok however, there are also well-known centres that cater specifically to foreigners wishing to learn and practise. The <b>International Buddhist Meditation Centre</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.mcu.ac.th/IBMC/">[25]</a> inside Wat Mahathat in <a href="/en/Bangkok/Rattanakosin" title="Bangkok/Rattanakosin">Rattanakosin</a> provides free meditation classes three times a day. If you can speak and understand the Thai language well enough, you may wish to go on your own retreat at a quiet temple on the outskirts of Bangkok. To pay for your stay, it is appreciated that you assist the resident monks on their morning alms rounds.
The Wat Pho temple in <a href="/en/Bangkok/Rattanakosin" title="Bangkok/Rattanakosin">Rattanakosin</a> offers well-regarded <b>Thai massage</b> courses.  While aimed squarely at tourists, this is not necessarily a bad thing, as they're used to conducting classes in English.
<b>Thai language schools</b> abound in Bangkok. Classes are attended by foreign aid workers, trust-fund babies seeking education visas, new residents, and retirees. Curriculum varies from school to school as do prices and time commitments.

<b>Tailoring tips</b><br />
Bangkok is particularly well-known for its plethora of <b>tailoring shops</b>; here you can get a custom-made suit for amazingly low prices compared to the West. Choosing a tailor is tricky though. Tailors in the middle of tourist areas, such as <a href="/en/Bangkok/Khao_San_Road" title="Bangkok/Khao San Road">Khao San Road</a> or <a href="/en/Bangkok/Sukhumvit" title="Bangkok/Sukhumvit">Nana Plaza</a>, generally provide poor quality and often quote silly prices.  An exception to this rule is Raja's Fashions at 1/6 Soi Sukhumvit Soi Nana 4, immediately south of the entrance to Nana Plaza, where Bobby Gulati and his father  have garnered worldwide acclaim as evidenced by several magazine articles and a recent mini-documentary on British television.  Avoid any tailor recommended by touts or tuk-tuk drivers as they cannot be trusted and you'll have to pay their commission; also avoid super-cheap packages or anything done in 24 hours, as the quality will suffer accordingly. The most important rule for getting a good tailor: do research. Don't just walk in the first tailor shop you see, but ask fellow travellers and look online for (user) reviews. In general, the best tailors are slightly off the tourist track in <a href="/en/Bangkok/Silom" title="Bangkok/Silom">Silom</a> and <a href="/en/Bangkok/Sukhumvit" title="Bangkok/Sukhumvit">Sukhumvit</a>.
It will help considerably if you know fabrics and what style you want (bring along a sample or at least a picture), and can spare the time for at least three sessions for a suit (measurement, fitting and final adjustment). Prices obviously depend on the tailor's skill and the materials used, but expect to pay at least 7,000 baht for a two-piece suit. When picking the materials, you're best off with Italian or English cloth as local fabrics are often of poor quality (with the exception of silk). Insist on two fittings for suits. Give the tailor a lot of detail and give yourself time, so you'll get the exact suit you're looking for.
Many tourists find a 150 Baht charge for a currency withdrawal from cash machines in Thailand - applied only to foreign bank cards - as an unpleasant surprise. If you are planning to exchange large sums, few offices of the SuperRich company consistently offer the top exchange rates. To save time, consider the green K Excellence booth by the entry to the City Rail Train station at the Savarnabhumi airport.
Siam Square is <i>the</i> place to shop in Bangkok; the small sois of Siam Square have dozens of small designer boutiques. <b>MBK Center</b> and <b>Siam Center</b> are the most popular shopping malls, as they sell fashion well below Western rates. <b>Siam Paragon</b> and the shopping plazas at Ratchaprasong feel even larger, but are much quieter, as most local Thais cannot afford the Guccis and Louis Vuittons on sale there. Ladies will also feel well at home in the <b>Emporium</b> in <a href="/en/Bangkok/Sukhumvit" title="Bangkok/Sukhumvit">Sukhumvit</a>.
Just take a few steps out of your hotel and Bangkok feels like a huge street market. <a href="/en/Bangkok/Sukhumvit" title="Bangkok/Sukhumvit">Sukhumvit</a> has the usual souvenirs, t-shirts and other tacky tourist junk. Browsing <a href="/en/Bangkok/Khao_San_Road" title="Bangkok/Khao San Road">Khao San Road</a>'s roadside stalls is particularly good for clothing and accessories, many of them for a bargain. While many of these stalls still cater to the traditional hippie crowd, they have been slowly gentrifying to appeal a broader audience. The nearby <b>Banglamphu Market</b> sells cheap knock-offs of everything, just like the night markets in <a href="/en/Bangkok/Silom" title="Bangkok/Silom">Silom</a> and <a href="/en/Bangkok/Rattanakosin" title="Bangkok/Rattanakosin">Rattanakosin</a>.
In the weekends, the <b>Chatuchak Weekend Market</b> in <a href="/en/Bangkok/Phahonyothin" title="Bangkok/Phahonyothin">Phahonyothin</a> is a must as its 8,000 stalls together form the largest market in Southeast Asia. Shoppers can buy just about everything from clothing to potted plants and everything in between â it is a paradise for browsers and bargain-hunters alike. A weekday alternative is <a href="/en/Bangkok/Pratunam" title="Bangkok/Pratunam">Pratunam</a>, one of the city's renowned garment markets. Clothes shopping here goes on wholesale, and you're even cheaper off if you buy in bulk. At <b>Pantip Plaza</b> you can buy computer-related stuff from branded laptops to pirated DVDs. Just be aware that many of the "brand name" items are fakes/copies.
<a href="/en/Bangkok/Yaowarat_and_Phahurat" title="Bangkok/Yaowarat and Phahurat">Yaowarat and Phahurat</a> give a more authentic experience, although many stores sell the cheap teen accessories found elsewhere as well. Just sitting at a plastic chair and watching daily commerce evolve is a fun activity in itself. Phahurat is the best destination for fabrics, available in all colours and sizes. <b>Pak Khlong Talat</b> is a surprisingly fun wholesale market for all kinds of cut flowers and vegetables. If you're a morning person, visit it around 03:00, when new flowers from upcountry arrive and the marketplace is beautifully illuminated.
<a href="/en/Bangkok/Thonburi" title="Bangkok/Thonburi">Thonburi</a>, being one of the least developed areas of Bangkok, is the best place to experience what the city used to be like. A must is the weekends-only <b>Taling Chan Floating Market</b>, which feels at least somewhat authentic as it blends a rural market with the canal side way of life. <b>Wang Lang Market</b> is an undiscovered gem with strictly local prices. The other side of the river, <a href="/en/Bangkok/Rattanakosin" title="Bangkok/Rattanakosin">Rattanakosin</a>, has everything a good Buddhist would need, be it amulets, monk bowls or human-sized Buddha statues.
For antiques, <a href="/en/Bangkok/Silom" title="Bangkok/Silom">Silom</a> is the place to go, as most potential buyers stay there in expensive hotels. <b>River City</b> in <a href="/en/Bangkok/Yaowarat_and_Phahurat" title="Bangkok/Yaowarat and Phahurat">Yaowarat</a> is the largest antique mall of the city, and priced to match. Gold and gems are popular buys, but be extremely wary as many tourists buy worthless pieces of cut glass believing it to be valuable gems. Never let a tuk-tuk driver convince you into a gem store, as more often than not, you're being ripped off. The same rule goes for tailoring shops; you can get a custom-made suit for amazingly cheap prices, but you have to know where to go, as many tailors provide bad quality â see the box for advice on finding a good tailor.
Browsing second hand English-language books can best be done on <a href="/en/Bangkok/Khao_San_Road" title="Bangkok/Khao San Road">Khao San Road</a>. For new releases, there are plenty of chain stores in shopping plazas, including <b>Asia Books</b>, <b>B2S</b>, <b>Bookazine</b> and <b>Kinokuniya</b>. There's a particularly wide array of books on Asian culture and history; some have a good selection of foreign newspapers and magazines as well.
Getting money in Bangkok is relatively easy; credit cards are widely accepted and ATMs are spread all over the city, especially in downtown areas. All banks charge a 150 baht commission for using foreign cards, Aeon Bank, Citibank and HSBC being the sole exceptions to this. Three of the most conveniently located Aeon ATMs can be found on Chakrapong street 170 meters walk north from western end of Khao San Road on ground floor of Tang Hua Seng supermarket (logo with T in circle visible from distance) and in the central part of the second floor of MBK Center in <a href="/en/Bangkok/Siam_Square" title="Bangkok/Siam Square">Siam Square</a> and at the first floor of Central Department Store at Silom Complex in <a href="/en/Bangkok/Silom" title="Bangkok/Silom">Silom</a>. HSBC Thailand's branch is located at 968 Rama IV Road, in front of Lumphini Park and it's the only one location of HSBC ATM in Thailand. Citibank ATMs in bangkok have 4 locations.
Best to keep away from buying fake degrees from the Khao San Road as they are either not from a real university or cannot be verified.
"The Mall" in Bangkapi has a water park on the top floor.  But, this huge mall does not have a map or directory located anywhere in the mall.   All needs for directions must be asked at the information desk.
<br />
Bangkok boasts a stunning 50,000 places to eat; not only thousands of Thai restaurants, but a wide selection of world-class <b>international cuisine</b> too. Prices are generally high by Thai standards, but cheap by international standards; a good meal is unlikely to cost more than 300 baht, although there are a few restaurants (primarily in hotels) where you can easily spend 10 times this.
<a href="/en/Bangkok/Sukhumvit" title="Bangkok/Sukhumvit">Sukhumvit</a> by far has the best restaurants of Bangkok, though prices tend to be high. Practically every cuisine in the world is represented here, be it French, Lebanese, Mexican, Vietnamese, or fusion combining many of these together in a quirky, but delicious mix. Bangkok's Italian town is <b>Soi Ton Son</b> near <a href="/en/Bangkok/Siam_Square" title="Bangkok/Siam Square">Siam Square</a>. Of course, for those on a budget, street stalls abound with simple Thai dishes at around 30 baht. There are especially plenty of budget restaurants in <a href="/en/Bangkok/Khao_San_Road" title="Bangkok/Khao San Road">Khao San Road</a>.
There are plenty of <b>vegetarian restaurants</b> in the more tourist-friendly parts of town (especially in hippie district <a href="/en/Bangkok/Khao_San_Road" title="Bangkok/Khao San Road">Khao San Road</a>). Vegetarian dishes are also readily available on the menus of regular restaurants. On request, even typical street restaurants will easily cook a vegetarian equivalent of a popular Thai dish for you. Ask for "jay" food to leave the meat out of the dish. For example, "khao pad" is fried rice and "khao pad jay" is vegetarian fried rice. For vegans, the most common animal product used would be oyster sauce. To avoid it, say "mai ao naam man hoi". Be aware that all street noodle vendors use animal broth for noodle soup.
Don't miss out on a cold <b>ice cream</b> in hot Bangkok. Western chain stores <b>Dairy Queen</b> and <b>Swensen's</b> have booths in many malls and shopping centres. Or better yet, try an exotic fruit-flavoured ice cream at an <b>Iberry</b> shop.  Their ice creams are tasty, cheap and safe to eat.
While not particularly high class, street food is among the most delicious food and can be found all over Bangkok â wherever you're staying, you rarely have to walk more than 100 m for a cart of street restaurant. Many of street vendors sell <b>satay</b> (à¸ªà¸°à¹à¸à¹à¸°) with hot sauce for 5-10 baht a piece.
One of Thailand's national dishes you can try is <b>pad thai</b> (à¸à¸±à¸à¹à¸à¸¢) and somtham, somtham is some of the most delicious food in Thailand if you ever go to Thailand that is the first thing you should try out when you are there, stir-fried rice noodles with eggs, fish sauce, tamarind juice and red chilli pepper. It can be prepared for you on one of the ubiquitous carts, or in a street restaurant for about 50 baht. You can order it with chicken (<i>gai</i>) or shrimps (<i>kung</i>). Another one of Thailand's national dishes you should try is <b>tom yam kung</b> (à¸à¹à¸¡à¸¢à¸³à¸à¸¸à¹à¸), a sour soup with prawns, lemongrass and galangal â beware, as it is <i>very</i> spicy! <b>Khao man kai</b> (à¸à¹à¸²à¸§à¸¡à¸±à¸à¹à¸à¹) is another popular street food. You can identify it at stalls displaying boiled chicken. Served with a bowl of fragrant chicken soup is a mound of rice topped with sliced chicken pieces and cucumber. Side sauces are spicy and go well with the bland chicken and rice. You can sometimes add optional liver and gizzard if that is your taste. If you like sweets, try to find a <b>kanom roti</b> (à¹à¸£à¸à¸µ) street vendor. The crepe-like dessert is filled with sweetened condensed milk, lots of sugar, and can also have bananas inside. Also fun to watch them being made.
<a href="/en/Bangkok/Khao_San_Road" title="Bangkok/Khao San Road">Khao San Road</a> is known for its carts selling <b>bugs</b> â yes, insects. They are deep fried, nutritious and quite tasty with the soy sauce that is sprayed on them. Types available: scorpions, water beetles, grasshoppers, crickets, bamboo larvae, mealworms and some more seasonal specialties. Break off the legs from grasshoppers and crickets or they will get stuck in your throat.
Be aware that the Pad Thai sold on the street on Khao San Road 
is changed to appeal to tourists , and is not an authentic Pad Thai.  Much better Pad Thai is available in almost any restaurant on Khao San.
<br />
Around the corner from Khao San Rd in front of the department store and supermarkets the street is lined with a myriad stalls selling all manner of tempting delicacies: sweets and crackers, coconut jellies, candied fruits, fish balls on skewers, tamarind sweets dipped in chilli and sugar and a host of other delights.
Thai dishes can roughly be categorised into central, northern, northeastern and southern cuisine. What's so great about Bangkok is that all these cuisines are present. <b>Isaan food</b> (from the northeast of Thailand) is a backpacker favourite; generally street restaurants serve on plenty of small plates that can be shared. <b>Som tam</b> (à¸ªà¹à¸¡à¸à¸³) is a salad made from shredded and pounded raw papaya â again, it is <i>spicy</i>, but oh so delicious. If you want to dine the Isaan way, also order some <b>khao niew</b> (sticky rice), <b>kai yang</b> (grilled chicken) and <b>moo yang</b> (grilled pork). Isaan food is very spicy; say <i>mai pet</i> or <i>pet nit noy</i> to tone it down. Southern Thai cuisine is also worth it; many of them have congregated around Wang Lang in <a href="/en/Bangkok/Thonburi" title="Bangkok/Thonburi">Thonburi</a>. At least try the <b>massaman curry</b> (à¹à¸à¸à¸¡à¸±à¸ªà¸¡à¸±à¹à¸), it's delicious.
The place to go to for <b>Chinese food</b> is <a href="/en/Bangkok/Yaowarat_and_Phahurat" title="Bangkok/Yaowarat and Phahurat">Yaowarat</a>. It has a range of street stalls and cheap restaurants selling expensive delicacies at affordable prices. <b>Soi Phadung Dao</b> is the best street for huge seafood restaurants. Try 1 kg of huge barbecued prawns for about 300 baht. <a href="/en/Bangkok/Yaowarat_and_Phahurat" title="Bangkok/Yaowarat and Phahurat">Phahurat</a>, Bangkok's Little India, has some decent Indian restaurants.
Dinner cruises on the Chao Phraya River are a touristy (but fun) way of spotting floodlit temples while chowing down on seafood and watching Thai cultural performances. Most operate buffet-style and the quality of the food is so-so, but there's lots of it and it's not too spicy. While the river can give a romantic experience, it can also be dirty and smelly with lots of plants floating around.
Note that drinks and tips are usually <i>not</i> included in the listed prices below. Always make a reservation before heading out to the pier. There are many competing operators, most of them depart from the <b>River City</b> pier next to the <b>Si Phraya</b> Express Boat pier. Major operators include:
<br />
Bangkok's nightlife is <b>infamously wild</b>, but it's not quite what it used to be: due to recent social order campaigns, there have been quite a lot of crack-downs on opening hours, nudity, drug use etc. Most restaurants, bars and clubs are now forced to close at 01:00 sharp, although quite a few are allowed to stay open till 02:00 or later. Informal roadside bars do stay open all night, particularly in <a href="/en/Bangkok/Sukhumvit" title="Bangkok/Sukhumvit">Sukhumvit</a> and <a href="/en/Bangkok/Khao_San_Road" title="Bangkok/Khao San Road">Khao San Road</a>. You must carry your <b>passport</b> for ID checks and police occasionally raid bars and discos, subjecting all customers to <b>drug tests</b> and searches, though these mostly occur at places that cater for hi-society Thais.
One of Bangkok's main party districts is <a href="/en/Bangkok/Silom" title="Bangkok/Silom">Silom</a>, home not only to perhaps the world's most famous go-go bar strip <b>Patpong</b>, but plenty of more legitimate establishments catering to all tastes. For a drink with a view, the open-air rooftop bars of <b>Vertigo</b> and <b>Sirocco</b> are particularly impressive. A large number of superhip and more expensive bars and nightclubs can be found in the higher sois of <a href="/en/Bangkok/Sukhumvit" title="Bangkok/Sukhumvit">Sukhumvit</a>, including <b>Bed Supperclub</b>, <b>Q Bar</b>, and <b>Narz</b>, as well as the hip area of <b>Thong Lo</b> (Soi 55).
Hippie hangout <a href="/en/Bangkok/Khao_San_Road" title="Bangkok/Khao San Road">Khao San Road</a> is also slowly gentrifying and a score of young artsy Thai teenagers have also made their mark there. Going out in Khao San Road is mostly casual, sitting at a roadside bar watching people pass by, but the <b>Gazebo Club</b> is a nightclub that stays open till the sun gets up. Most of the younger Thais prefer to congregate around <a href="/en/Bangkok/Ratchadaphisek" title="Bangkok/Ratchadaphisek">Ratchadaphisek</a>, home to the <b>Royal City Avenue</b> strip of nightclubs.
Smoking is forbidden in all restaurants, bars and nightclubs, whether air-conditioned or non-air-conditioned. Remarkably for Thailand, this rule is strictly enforced.
<b>Behaving while misbehavin'</b><br />
Some simple rules of etiquette to follow in a 
go-go bar:
The <b>go-go bar</b> is an institution of Bangkok's "naughty nightlife". In a typical go-go, several dozen dancers in bikinis (or less) crowd the stage, shuffling back and forth to loud music and trying to catch the eye of punters in the audience. Some (but not all) also put on <b>shows</b> where girls perform on stage, but these are generally tamer than you'd expect â nudity, for example, is technically forbidden. In a <b>beer bar</b>, there are no stages and the girls are wearing street clothes.
If this sounds like a thinly veiled veneer for prostitution, it is. Although some point to the large number of American GIs during the Vietnam War as the point of origin of the Thai sex trade, others have claimed that current Thai attitudes towards sexuality have deeper roots in Thai history. Both go-go and beer bars are squarely aimed at the <i>foreign tourists</i> and it's fairly safe to assume that most if not all Thais in them are on the take. That said, it's perfectly OK to check out these shows without actually partaking, and there are more and more curious couples and even the occasional tour group attending. The main area is around <b>Patpong</b> in <a href="/en/Bangkok/Silom" title="Bangkok/Silom">Silom</a>, but similar bars to the ones at Patpong can be found in <a href="/en/Bangkok/Sukhumvit" title="Bangkok/Sukhumvit">Sukhumvit</a>, at <b>Nana Entertainment Plaza</b> (Soi 4) and <b>Soi Cowboy</b> (Soi 23). <b>Soi 33</b> is packed with hostess bars, which are more upscale than the Soi Cowboy and Nana Plaza bars and do not feature go-go dancing. Before heading to these places, be sure to read the <a href="/en/Bangkok#Stay_safe" title="Bangkok">Stay safe</a> section for some additional advice.
As go-go bars close around 01:00, there are so-called <b>after-hour clubs</b> that stay open till the sun gets up. They are not hard to find â just hop in a taxi. Taxi drivers are eager to drive you there, as they get a hefty commission from club owners to bring you to them â you might even get the ride for free. These clubs generally feel grim and edgy, and there are so-called "freelancers" among the girls (prostitutes). Some well-known after-hour clubs include ""Climax"" on Soi 11,  <b>Bossy Club</b> in <a href="/en/Bangkok/Pratunam" title="Bangkok/Pratunam">Pratunam</a>, <b>Spicy Club</b> near <a href="/en/Bangkok/Siam_Square" title="Bangkok/Siam Square">Siam Square</a> and the always famous <b>Thermae</b> on Sukhumvit between sois 15 and 17 in the basement underneath the <b>Ruamchit</b> short time hotel.
Thais are generally accepting of homosexuality and Bangkok has a very active gay nightlife scene, concentrated in <a href="/en/Bangkok/Silom" title="Bangkok/Silom">Silom</a>'s Soi 2, Soi 4 and a short strip of gay go-go bars known as <b>Soi Twilight</b> (off Surawong Road). Gay strip bars all have free entry, but charge an extra 150 baht or so for drinks. The most popular gay drinking bars are <b>The Balcony</b> and <b>Telephone Pub</b> at Silom Soi 4, which are busy until 23:00. For the disco crowd, <b>DJ Station</b> and its late-night neighbour <b>G.O.D. Club</b> (located at Silom Soi 2) are packed every night beginning around 23:00. Between 17:00-22:00 over 200 men from around the world cruise, swim, dine and party at the nearby <b>Babylon</b>, considered by many to be the best gay sauna in the world. Babylon also has a budget and luxury accommodation.
All of these bars and clubs are aimed at gay men and the lesbian scene is much more low-key. Since the opening of full-time lesbian bars <b>Zeta</b> and <b>E-Fun</b>, a small lesbian community is starting to emerge along <a href="/en/Bangkok/Ratchadaphisek" title="Bangkok/Ratchadaphisek">Royal City Avenue</a>. <b>Lesla</b> (near <a href="/en/Bangkok/Phahonyothin" title="Bangkok/Phahonyothin">Phahonyothin</a>) is a lesbian bar that is opened on Saturday nights only. Bring along your passport for entrance age checking (they do not allow people under 20 years old).
Some Thai regulars in the gay nightlife scene skirt the fine line between partying and prostitution, and the Western visitor, being considered richer, is expected to pay any food and drink expenses and perhaps provide some "taxi money" in the morning. It's usually wise to ask a boy you pick up in a bar or club if he is after money, as it's not uncommon for them to start demanding money after sex. However most Thai bois looking for money for sex will refer to themselves as 'money boys' and as long as you ask them this with discretion its considered OK!
<b>Book online, save money</b><br />
While most guest houses in Khao San Road do not even bother to have a website, with moderate and upper end hotels you can save a surprisingly large amount of money by booking via the web. In most cases, walk-in rates are known to be about 30% higher than online rates as administration costs are higher and front desk personnel often get paid by commission. When standing inside the hotel's lobby, sometimes it can pay off to use the free Wi-Fi, get online, book for the same night and get it for less! To give an example, some mid-range hotels offer walk-in rates for 1,500 baht the night, but online rates for 1,000 baht. That's five free beers on the hotel!
Bangkok has a vast range of accommodation, including some of the best hotels in the world â and some of the worst dives too. Broadly speaking, <a href="/en/Bangkok/Khao_San_Road" title="Bangkok/Khao San Road">Khao San Road</a> is backpacker city; the riverside of <a href="/en/Bangkok/Silom" title="Bangkok/Silom">Silom</a> and <a href="/en/Bangkok/Thonburi" title="Bangkok/Thonburi">Thonburi</a> is home to <b>The Oriental</b> and <b>The Peninsula</b> respectively, often ranked among the best in the world (and priced to match). Most of the city's moderate and expensive hotels can be found in <a href="/en/Bangkok/Siam_Square" title="Bangkok/Siam Square">Siam Square</a>, <a href="/en/Bangkok/Sukhumvit" title="Bangkok/Sukhumvit">Sukhumvit</a> and <a href="/en/Bangkok/Silom" title="Bangkok/Silom">Silom</a>, though they also have their share of budget options.
When choosing your digs, think of the amount of luxury you want to pay for â air-conditioning can be advised, as temperatures don't drop below 20Â°C at night. Also pay careful attention to Skytrain, metro and express boat access, as a well-placed station or pier could make your stay in Bangkok much more comfortable. In general, accommodation in Bangkok is cheap though. It's possible to have a decent double room with hot shower and air-conditioning for about 500 baht/night. If you want more luxury, expect to pay around 1,500 baht for a double room in downtown. Even staying at one of Bangkok's top hotels only sets you back around 5,000 baht â the price of a standard double room in Europe.
One Bangkok hotel phenomenon of note is the <b>guest fee</b> of around 500 baht added to your bill if you bring along a newly found friend for the night. Some hotels even <i>refuse</i> Thai guests altogether, this is especially common in Khao San Road. These rules are obviously aimed at controlling local sex workers, which is why hotel security will usually hold onto your guest's ID card for the duration of the visit, but some hotels will also apply it to Western visitors â or, more embarrassingly, try to apply it to your Thai partner. Look for the signs, or, if in doubt, ask the staff before check-in.
Given its size, Bangkok is surprisingly safe, with violent crimes like mugging and robbery unusual but you should be careful, of course. One of the biggest dangers is motorbikes who ride on pavements at speed, go through red lights, undertake buses as they stop to let passengers off and generally drive far too fast especially through stationary traffic. If you are going to hire a bike, make sure you have insurance in case you are injured. You may be the world's best driver but you'll meet many of the world's worst drivers in Thailand.
Bangkok does have more than its fair share of <b>scams</b>, and many individuals in the tourist business do not hesitate to <b>overcharge</b> unwary visitors. As a rule of thumb, it is wise to decline all offers made by someone who appears to be a friendly local giving a hapless tourist some local advice. Never get in a tuk-tuk if someone else is trying to get you into one. Most Bangkok locals do not approach foreigners without an ulterior motive.
<b>What to do if you fall for the gem scam</b><br />
As long as you're still in Thailand, it's not too late. Contact the <b>Tourist Authority of Thailand</b>, â +66 2 694-1222) or the <b>Tourist Police</b>, â 1155 immediately, file a police report, and return to the store to claim a refund â they <b>must</b>, by law, return 80%. If your gems have been mailed, contact the <b>Bangkok Mail Centre</b>, â +66 2 215-0966(-195) immediately and ask them to track your package; they'll find it if you act fast, and know the name, address and date it was mailed.
You should always be on the look-out for scammers, especially in major tourist areas. There are dozens of scams in Bangkok, but by far the most widely practiced is the <b>gem scam</b>. Always beware of tuk-tuk drivers offering <b>all-day tours for prices as low as 10 baht</b>. You may indeed be taken on a full-day tour, but you will end up only visiting one gem and souvenir shop after another. Don't buy any products offered by pushy salesmen â the "gems" are pretty much always worthless pieces of cut glass and the suits are of deplorable quality. The tuk-tuk driver gets a commission if you buy something â and fuel coupons even if you don't. Unless the idea of travelling by tuk-tuk appeals to you, it's almost always cheaper, more comfortable and less hassle to take a metered taxi.
In general, never ask a taxi driver for a recommendation for something. They will very likely take you to a place where they get a commission, and be of dubious quality. In particular, do not ask a taxi driver for a restaurant recommendation. An infamous place taxi drivers take unsuspecting tourists is Somboon D which is a terrible seafood restaurant in a seedy area under the train tracks on Makkasan Road (02 6527 7667). A typical meal there costs 800 THB per person and it comes with little seafood, no service, and complaints are not taken by management. Instead of asking a taxi driver, search the web, ask a local on the street, or just walk around -- you will surprise yourself with what is around a corner in Bangkok.
Be highly skeptical when an English-speaking Thai at a popular tourist attraction approaches you <i>out of the blue</i>, telling that your intended destination is <i>currently closed</i> or offering discount admissions. Temples are almost always free (the main exceptions are Wat Phra Kaew and Wat Pho) and open just about every day of the year. Anyone telling you otherwise, even if they have an official-looking identification card, is most likely out to scam you, especially if they suggest a tuk-tuk ride to some alternate sights to see until the sight re-opens. At paid admission sites, verify the operating hours at the ticket window.
If you entered one of these tuk-tuks, touts often will drop you off at a certain place, such as a genuine Buddhist temple. Here you will find a man that claims to be an official, and he guides you in a certain direction. There you will find another "official" who also claims that a certain attraction is closed. This way, a tourist hears the same statement by multiple people, and is more eager to believe that his or her intended destination indeed is closed. Never get involved with these scammers or believe any of their statements.
When getting a taxi, it is a good idea to <b>hail a moving taxi</b> from the main road, or to walk a short distance out of a major tourist area before looking for one. This is no guarantee of honesty, but greatly increases your chances of finding an honest driver, of which there are plenty in Bangkok, even if it sometimes seems that every driver is on the make. Most of the untrustworthy drivers are the ones standing still in tourist areas. Another important rule of thumb is to <b>insist on the meter</b> for taxis and <b>agree on a price in advance</b> for tuk-tuks. If they refuse, or quote silly prices, just walk out and get a different one as they're rarely in short supply. The Thai phrase to ask a driver to use the meter is <i>mee-TOE, khap</i> if you're male and <i>mee-TOE, kha</i> if you're female.
Beware of tuk-tuk or taxi drivers who approach you speaking good English or with an "I â¥ farang" sign, especially those who mention or take you to a tailor shop (or any kind of business). They are paid by inferior tailor shops to bring tourists there to be subjected to high pressure sales techniques. If at any point your transportation brings you somewhere you didn't intend or plan to go, walk away immediately, ignore any entreaties to the contrary, and find another taxi or tuk-tuk.
Beware of a very overweight Western woman who approaches you with a story about how her luggage has just been stolen and needs money to get home. For several years now, she has usually lurked around the tourist attractions in Bangkok looking for prey. The scam industry in Bangkok is large enough to employ farangs!
Also beware of <b>private bus companies</b> offering direct trips from Bangkok to other cities with "VIP" buses. There are a lot of scams performed by these private bus companies. The so-called direct VIP trips may end up changing three or four uncomfortable minibuses to the destination, and the 10-11 hour trip may well turn into 17-18 hours. Instead, try to book public BKS buses from the main bus terminals. It's worth the extra shoe-leather, as there have been reports of robberies on private buses as well.
As of 2012, there is a scam involving the local police and marijuana. If you attempt to purchase marijuana from one of the taxi or tuk-tuk drivers on Kao San Rd., there is the potential that you will get ripped off by the police. The scam goes like this: you ask for the weed, and the driver will tell you he knows a friend who he will call. The friend will show up and take you in the tuk-tuk to do the marijuana/money exchange. You'll get some terrible quality stuff and then get dropped off. Immediately after being dropped off, local police will run up on you and search you, finding the marijuana. Then, you'll be forced to go to the station with them and bribe. The going rate is $1,000 USD but you could bargain down to $600. They will walk you to the ATM and watch you withdraw the money, which you then hand over as your "fee" to go free. It's an awful scam. Don't try to buy marijuana in Bangkok unless you know what you're doing.
Bangkok is known for its go-go bars and the prostitution that comes along with it. Technically, some aspects of prostitution are illegal (eg. soliciting, pimping), but enforcement is rare, and brothels are common. It's not illegal to pay for sex or to pay a "barfine" (a fee the bar collects if you want to take an employee away).
The age of consent in Thailand is 15, but a higher minimum age of 18 applies in the case of prostitutes. Penalties for sex with minors are harsh. All adult Thais must carry an identity card, which will state that they were born in 2534 or earlier if they were over the age of 18 on January 1, 2010 (in the Thai calendar, 2010 is the year 2553). Many hotels retain the ID cards of prostitutes for the duration of their visit. Whilst most prostitutes are employed by bars or similar businesses, some are "freelancers". Petty theft and other problems are more common with these freelancers. HIV and AIDS awareness is better than it used to be, but infection statistics among entertainment industry workers remain high; freelancers are the highest risk group. Almost all girls insist on using condoms.
While walking in go-go bar areas is generally safe, you have to be cautious of touts who try to drag you into the <b>Patpong upstairs bars</b> with offers of ping-pong shows and 100-baht beer. The beer may well be 100 baht, but the "show" you'll be treated to will be 1,000 baht or more. A good idea is to let your friend check the place with you waiting outside (and if he won't go out in few mins you will call police) and don't interact with worker during show, don't drink anything offered, don't let some friendly Thai sit next to you and talk to you, because you will end up paying for everything mentioned, if you follow this advice you can see ping pong show for 200 baht without paying anything else, just the ticket to bar.
Do not get into fights with locals. Thais are peace loving people, but when a Thai fights a foreigner, it is never a fair fight. You'll wind up having to fight 10-20 others who were not initially involved, or the police will be called and not do anything to assist you (especially the Metropolitan Police, as they normally have very limited English skills; always contact the Tourist Police (telephone <b>1155</b>) when in trouble). Thais are also notorious for fighting with weaponry (guns, knives, broken bottles, metal rods) or employing Muay Thai techniques. These are usually produced from their concealed locations, with foreigners getting seriously injured or worse. Just avoid all confrontations. If you do get involved in a situation, it is better to apologise and get the heck out of there. In Thailand, discretion is definitely the better part of valour.
Elephants are a large part of Thailand's tourist business, and the smuggling and mistreatment of elephants for tourist attractions is a widespread practice. Be aware that elephants are often separated from their mothers at a young age to be cruelly trained under captivity for the rest of their lives. It is advised to take an <b>elephant ride</b> only at animal friendly organisations.
A depressingly common sight on the congested streets of Bangkok is <b>elephant begging</b>. During night hours, mahouts (trainers) with lumbering elephants approach tourists to feed the creatures bananas or take a photo with them for a fee. The elephants are brought to the city to beg in this way because they are out of work and are mistreated and visibly distressed under the conditions of the city. Please avoid supporting this cruelty by rejecting the mahouts as they offer you bananas to feed the elephants. This is especially common in Silom and Sukhumvit.
Due to its location, lax laws, and resources, many <b>illegal animal products</b> come through Bangkok. Rare and endangered species are often sold at markets for pets (especially at Chatuchak), and many other animal products are sold as luxury items. Avoid buying rare pets, leather, ivory, talons, dried sea creatures (such as starfish), fur, feathers, teeth, wool, and other products since  they are most likely the result of illegal poaching, and buying them contributes greatly to animal endangerment and abuse.
In 2008, <b>political unrest</b> hit the headlines, with the yellow-shirted People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD) closing down both of Bangkok's airports for a week with several people killed in political violence. After the new prime minister was elected, things were more or less back to normal for a while, but the situation remained unstable. In 2010, new political unrest surfaced with red-shirted protesters from the United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship (UDD) occupying much of downtown Bangkok. These protests turned violent when government troops tried to take back parts of central Bangkok that had been seized by protesters. Always follow the independent press for the newest political developments, stay away from demonstrations.
As elsewhere in Thailand, be careful with what you eat. Outside of major tourist hotels and resorts, stay away from raw leafy vegetables, egg-based dressings like mayonnaise, unpackaged ice cream and minced meat as hot weather tends to make food go bad faster. In short, stick to boiled, baked, fried, or peeled goods.
Tap water in Bangkok is said to be safe when it comes out the plant, but unfortunately the plumbing along the way often is not, so it's wise to avoid drinking the stuff, even in hotels. Any water served to you in good restaurants will at least be boiled, but it's better to order sealed bottles instead, which are available everywhere at low prices.
Take care with ice, which may be made with tap water of questionable potability as above.  Some residents claim that ice with round holes is made by commercial ice makers who purify their water; others state that it is wise not to rely on that claim.
Internet cafÃ©s abound in Bangkok. You'll generally be looking at rates of around 30-60 baht per hour in tourist-laden districts like <a href="/en/Bangkok/Khao_San_Road" title="Bangkok/Khao San Road">Khao San Road</a>, 20-30 baht per hour in downtown (the top floors of MBK for example), and 10-15 baht per hour if you would venture into residential areas (where the speed generally is still high).
An increasing number of cafÃ©s and pubs offer free Wi-Fi to their customers, including the ubiquitous <b>Coffee World</b> chain in all of its branches (ask for the password at the counter). <b>TrueMove</b> offers both free and paid Wi-Fi access. If you want to get online for free, you must register first, and both session and overall time is limited. Their network is accessible in many malls, including <a href="/en/Bangkok/Siam_Square" title="Bangkok/Siam Square">Siam Square</a>, and sometimes can be available from your room if you stay in a nearby hot-spot â just look for the 'truewifi' network, you can register right there. Most hotels and guest houses provide at least some form of Internet. Some have Wi-Fi access inside the rooms â but inquire before booking.
There is not a lot of free Wi-Fi available in old districts like <a href="/en/Bangkok/Rattanakosin" title="Bangkok/Rattanakosin">Rattanakosin</a> or <a href="/en/Bangkok/Yaowarat_and_Phahurat" title="Bangkok/Yaowarat and Phahurat">Yaowarat</a>. Note that McDonald's and Starbucks do not provide free Wi-Fi. There's either no Wi-Fi at all or you'll have to pay for it.
The area code for Bangkok is <b>02</b>. You only need to dial the 0 if you're calling from within Thailand. Pay phones are not commonplace, as most Thais have a mobile phone. If you want to avoid high roaming costs, you can buy a local SIM card for 100 baht at Suvarnabhumi Airport (or other mobile phone stores throughout the city). The 100 baht is not just for the SIM card, but is immediately your first pre-paid amount. Topping it up is easy; just walk into a 7-Eleven convenience store and pick an amount you want to add. Making international calls is also cheaper this way.
Bangkok's red post boxes are found all over the city. There are also plenty of <b>Thailand Post</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.thailandpost.com/">[33]</a> offices around for sending post and packages. In tourist areas, there are post offices in the Khao San Road area (in front of Wat Bowonniwet) and at Sukhumvit Road (between Soi 4 and 6).
If you're staying in Bangkok for a longer time, you might want to make use of <i>poste restante</i>, so other people can send you letters or parcels using a post office's address. Post offices keep the letters for at least two months. Letters sent via poste restante must have the receiver's name on it, with the family name in underlined capital letters. If you want to pick them up near Khao San Road (opposite Wat Bowonniwet), it must be addressed to Poste Restante, Banglamphubon Post Office, Bangkok, 10203, Thailand. If you want to pick up your post in the Sukhumvit area, make sure it is addressed to Poste Restante, Nana Post Office, Sukhumvit Road, Bangkok, 10112, Thailand.
The word is out on the quality and value of Thailandâs healthcare, and the numbers of visitors coming has increased accordingly. Patients have come to love the sparkling modern facilities with all the latest equipment, the highly professional doctors and medical staffs â many with Western certification, and especially the gentle nature and famous Thai service touch they receive everywhere in Thailand.
Many travellers go to Bangkok to undergo medical treatments at a fraction of the cost charged in their home countries. The best-regarded (and most expensive) is <b>Bumrungrad Hospital</b>, which attracts about 400,000 foreign patients per year or an average of 1,000+ a day. Other hospitals, such as <b>Samitivej</b> also specialize in serving foreigners. Private hospitals in Thailand are accredited by the government according to international standards, and many of the doctors in Thailand hold international accreditation and relevant licences.
Thailand was the first country in Southeast Asia to receive JCI accreditation, and many of Bangkokâs hospitals have won international awards and are internationally accredited. [source6] Thailandâs 21 JCI-accredited hospitals (as of August 2013) are: Bangkok Heart Hospital, Bangkok Hospital, Bangkok International Dental Center, BNH Hospital, Bumrungrad International, Central General Hospital, Chaophya Hospital, Metta International Eye Center (Ambulatory Care), Navamin 9 Hospital, Nonthavej Hospital, Praram 9 Hospital, Ramkhamhaeng Hospital, Saimai Hospital, Samitivej Srinakarin Hospital, Samitivej Sukhumvit Hospital, Sikarin Hospital, Synphaet Hospital, Vejthani Hospital, Vibhavadi Hospital, Wattanosoth Cancer Hospital and Yanhee Hospital. <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.thailandmedtourism.com/FileUpload/MultimediaFile/110907110841672.pdf">[36]</a>
The Clinical Care Program Certification (CCPC) includes 15 categories of clinical services for certification; the following 5 Thailand hospitals have received certificates from the Joint Commission International (JCI) for CCPC in the following areas: <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.thailandmedtourism.com/FileUpload/MultimediaFile/130909045301107.pdf">[37]</a>
Bangkok Hospital Medical Center
Bumrungrad International
Samitivej Srinakarin Hospital
Samitivej Sukhumvit Hospital
Vejthani Hospital
Popular treatments, ranging from cosmetic, organ transplants and orthopedic treatments to dental and cardiac surgeries, are available at a price much lower than the U.S. or Europe. For example, Bumrungrad Hospital charges 90,000 baht for an all-inclusive breast implant package. Bangkok is also well-known as a centre for <b>sexual reassignment surgery</b> for people wishing to change their physical sex, although this falls out of the scope of a casual vacation.
Dental and medical clinics are everywhere in Bangkok; one can hardly walk ten minutes without seeing signs for doctors and dentists. They range from small one-chair clinics to entire buildings devoted solely to dental treatment. One such place is Bangkok International Dental Center (BIDC), which employs some 80 dentists with over 120 highly-trained and experienced staff. BIDC was the first dental center in Thailand to be awarded JCI accreditation, the gold standard of medical certification. Despite the global standards and latest equipment, prices still make one smile at 50-70% less for comparable treatments in Western countries. <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.thailandmedtourism.com/FileUpload/MultimediaFile/130909045753622.pdf">[38]</a>
On the dental side, popular procedures are available most everywhere, including teeth whitening, dental implants, and orthodontics. For those searching for skin-care treatments, look no further: Bangkok offers scores of dermatology clinics and a multitude of procedures and treatments.
There are many dental clinics with English-speaking dentists and staff. The largest of them is the <b>Bangkok International Dental Center</b> (<i>BIDC</i>) <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.bangkokdentalcenter.com/">[39]</a> with branches in <a href="/en/Bangkok/Ratchadaphisek" title="Bangkok/Ratchadaphisek">Ratchadaphisek</a> and <a href="/en/Bangkok/Siam_Square" title="Bangkok/Siam Square">Siam Square</a>. There are also plenty of teeth whitening, implant and orthodontic providers over town.
Bangkok is an ideal place to get your travel vaccinations. The <b>Queen Saovabha Memorial Institute</b> provide red cross sealed immunizations for much cheaper than most other countries. This [guide] <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://global-goose.com/travel-stories/immunizations-in-bangkok/">[40]</a> details how shots that would have cost over US$500 in North America came to less than $30.
The Thai Red Cross Anonymous Clinic <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.redcross.or.th/old/english/service/medical_clinicaids.php">[41]</a> on Ratchadamri Road (approximately 5 minutes walk from BTS Ratchadamri, towards Silom) provides low cost sexual health services for those in need. It has English speaking doctors, HIV test results within the hour (200 baht), and a dispensary for medications to treat other venereal diseases. It is busy so be prepared for a wait. Donations are greatly appreciated, there is a large box near the exit for this purpose.
The <b>Immigration Bureau</b>, has moved from central Soi Suan Plu to far-away Government Building B in Chaeng Wattana Soi 7, â +66 2 141-9889, <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.immigration.go.th">[42]</a>, M-F 08:30-noon, 13:00-16:30). The centre is in the far north of Bangkok near the old Don Muang Airport. It is a spacious building with a ground floor cafÃ©, restaurants and copy vendors. Visas, re-entry permits and many other immigration services are available. It is best to take the Skytrain to Mo Chit station and then hail a taxi to the government centre. Services for Myanmarese, Cambodian and Lao citizens remain at Soi Suan Plu.
If you want to get out of the city for a while, there are plenty of day trip options from Bangkok.
Bangkok is also an excellent hub for onward travel into other regions of <a href="/en/Thailand" title="Thailand">Thailand</a>.
