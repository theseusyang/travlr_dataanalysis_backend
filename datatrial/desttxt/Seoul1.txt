<b>Seoul</b> (ìì¸) is the capital of <a href="/en/South_Korea" title="South Korea">South Korea</a>. With a municipal population of over 11.8 million, and a metropolitan population totaling over 25.6 million, Seoul is by far South Korea's largest city and one of East Asia's financial and cultural epicenters. A fascinating blend of ancient traditions and cutting-edge digital technology, home to endless street food vendors and vast nightlife districts, an extraordinarily high-pressure educational system and serene Buddhist temples, a trend-setting youth culture and often crushing conformism, extraordinary architecture and endless monotonous rows of grey apartment buildings, Seoul is a city filled with stark contrasts.
With over 11.8 million people, a figure that more than doubles if you include neighboring cities and suburbs, Seoul is the largest city in South Korea and unquestionably the economic, political and cultural hub of the country. By some measures it is the second largest urban agglomeration on the planet, after Greater <a href="/en/Tokyo" title="Tokyo">Tokyo</a>.
Seoul has a long history stretching far back into Korea's dynastic past. There is evidence for settlement in this area as far as 18 BC but Seoul as the capital city of Korea has a history back to the 14th century. Originally named Hanseong (íì±; æ¼¢å), the city was the capital of the Joseon Dynasty from 1392 to 1910, and remained the capital of Korea during the period of Japanese colonial rule which followed under the name Gyeongseong (ê²½ì±; äº¬å), or Keijo in Japanese. The Joseon Dynasty built most of Seoul's most recognisable landmarks, including the Five Grand Palaces and Namdaemun. After the Japanese surrender in 1945, the city was re-named to its current name, Seoul. Since the establishment of the Republic of Korea in 1948, Seoul has been the capital of South Korea. Occupied twice during the Korean War by Communist forces, the city was extensively rebuilt and today is one of Asia's primary metropolises.
While few historical points of interest remain (most of the temples and palaces are reconstructions), much of Seoul's infrastructure is exceptionally modern and clean. Skyscrapers and high rises abound. The subway system is the third-largest in the world and perhaps one of the finest. Seoul is truly vast - though the casual traveler can see most of the main sites in a few days, a dedicated traveler could spend weeks exploring all the alleyways and far-off neighborhoods. As the capital of a country that has gone through massive development in the past sixty years, it is constantly changing at an incredible pace, matched only by the mainland Chinese cities. This frantic pace of life is reflected everywhere - in Seoul's cutting-edge digital technology, in the millions of commuters rushing to work everyday, in one of the vibrant nightlife scene, and in the thousands of buildings still under construction.
In recent years, Seoul has been swamped with tourists from China, Japan, and Southeast Asia, following the success of Korean pop culture. Travelers will frequently overhear Japanese, Mandarin, or Cantonese; many restaurants and stores, especially in the more touristy areas like Myeongdong, will have signs in Japanese and Chinese as well as Korean and English. Long popular among Asians, Seoul has been relatively unknown in the West and frequently passed over by Westerners for nearby <a href="/en/Shanghai" title="Shanghai">Shanghai</a>, <a href="/en/Tokyo" title="Tokyo">Tokyo</a>, <a href="/en/Beijing" title="Beijing">Beijing</a>, and <a href="/en/Hong_Kong" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a>. However, recently things have been changing; tourism numbers to Seoul have been exploding in the past five years or so, with no indications of slowing down or stopping.
<br />
Seoul is a very well organized city covering over 600 kmÂ² with a population of around 11.8 million. It is a new modern city built on an ancient and shining history. The city is located in the north-western portion of South Korea approximately 40 km east of the Yellow Sea and 60 km south of the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). The city is roughly bisected by the Han River (íê° <i>Hangang</i>), which runs east to west across the city. Seoul blurs seamlessly into its surrounding satellite cities, most of which are also served by the Seoul metro. The largest of these is Incheon (to the west) in which Seoul's main Airport, and the area's main seaport, are located. Other satellite cities include such as Ilsan (to the north) and <a href="/en/Anyang" title="Anyang">Anyang</a> (to the south).
Administratively, Seoul is divided into 25 districts (êµ¬ <i>gu</i>), each with an area and population comparable to a small city. The districts are then further subdivided into 522 sub-districts (ë <i>dong</i>). The Han river bisects the city, splitting it into two halves: Gangbuk (ê°ë¶), the northern, more historical half, and and Gangnam (ê°ë¨), the southern, wealthier and more modern half. The sheer size of the city means that travelers to Seoul will find it difficult to locate a true "center" of Seoul; instead, Seoul is almost more like a collection of cities that happen to be bunched together, each with their own central business and commercial districts. The two largest core areas are Jongno/Jung in the north, and Gangnam in the south. For travelers with more time, there are many more, smaller centers and districts to be explored, such as the island of Yeoui-do and the college district of Hongdae/Sinchon. For the typical traveler, it would be useful to divide the city into the following areas:
Most visitors arrive via <b><a href="/en/Yeongjong_Island" title="Yeongjong Island">Incheon International Airport</a></b> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IATA" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:IATA">IATA</a>: <b>ICN</b>),(<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.airport.kr/eng/">[1]</a>), located on <a href="/en/Yeongjong_Island" title="Yeongjong Island">Yeongjong Island</a> in the neighboring city of <a href="/en/Incheon" title="Incheon">Incheon</a> and covered in detail <a href="/en/Yeongjong_Island" title="Yeongjong Island">in its own article</a>.
The <b>A'REX</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.arex.or.kr/">[2]</a> train link connects the airport to Seoul Station (for further connections to KTX high-speed services) and Gimpo Airport (most domestic flights), operating from 5:20 AM until midnight.  Two versions exist: Express services to the city (every half hour) takes 43 minutes and cost â©8,000 (with WiFi available on board), while commuter services (every 6 minutes) take 53 minutes and cost â©3,700.
It is worth noting that with some airlines you can check into your Incheon flight in Seoul Station before you get on the AREX train. Immigration officers are also on hand to stamp your passport, which means you are processed and can quickly go through the Diplomatic Departures entrance in Incheon Airport.
Travel time to Gimpo Airport is 28/35 minutes, with both services charging â©3100, making this the fastest and cheap option for intra-airport transfer as well.  If you are heading to Incheon International from Seoul Station and using Korean, Asiana or Jeju Air, the express train may be your best option. You can check your bags and even pass through security and immigration, allowing you to skip the lines at the airport and to spend a little longer in the city, or helping you make a mad dash to the airport.
However, if you have a lot of luggage or are heading to southern parts of Seoul (eg. Gangnam), the airport buses remain your best option.  <b>Limousine buses</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.kallimousine.com/">[3]</a> (â©15,000 to/from city for one way, â©6500 to/from Gimpo Airport (domestic flight)) travel directly to major areas and big hotels in Seoul, while public buses (â©8,000-9.000) will take you to major transit hubs.  If you're visiting for the first time, it's worth paying a bit extra for the limousine bus. For either bus type, consult the big maps or staff to figure out which route best suits your needs; you can then find the shuttles outside 1st floor arrivals (if possible get this information from your hotel before arriving).  Or simply, walk out and ask the many ticket sellers (they are wearing vests) which bus goes to your hotel because if it's a popular one or in a popular area, they'll surely know which you'll need. It's best to buy tickets at any of the the ticket gates near the bus arrival area but you can also pay the fare using won or a T-Money card if you have one. The limousine bus drivers are extremely friendly but don't count on them knowing too much English. There are maps inside the buses letting passengers know which stops are upcoming and these are also announced in Korean and English. Pressing any of the red buttons inside signals to the driver you want off at the next stop.
You can purchase and recharge a T-Money card at the GS25 store which is located at the end of the arrivals area, next to "International Arrivals F" exit.
If you have a late flight and plan on getting into Seoul via bus, make sure you get out to the curb as soon as you can. The last buses run shortly after the last flights land. If you miss your bus, you'll be stuck paying for a taxi, as the trains will stop running too.
A taxi direct to Seoul will cost around â©50,000/70,000 regular/deluxe. Black deluxe taxis (ëª¨ë² íì) and almost all regular taxis accept credit cards, but a few regular taxis (ì¼ë° íì) may not. Ask the driver before you get on if you can pay by credit card. You are expected to pay any road tolls on top of the meter fare. Having your destination written down in Korean will be very helpful. Steer clear of taxi drivers trying to pick you up from inside the terminal and even the bus stop.  As both buses and taxis are subject to traffic, allow extra time for rush hour delays (or take the train back).
The closer but older <b>Gimpo Airport</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.airport.co.kr/doc/gimpo_eng/">[4]</a> (ê¹í¬êµ­ì ê³µí­, <b>GMP</b>) caters only to the shuttle services to <a href="/en/Tokyo" title="Tokyo">Tokyo</a>-Haneda, <a href="/en/Osaka" title="Osaka">Osaka</a>-Kansai, <a href="/en/Taipei" title="Taipei">Taipei</a>-Songshan, <a href="/en/Shanghai" title="Shanghai">Shanghai</a>-Hongqiao and <a href="/en/Beijing" title="Beijing">Beijing</a>, as well as domestic flights within <a href="/en/South_Korea" title="South Korea">South Korea</a>.
Gimpo Airport is easily reached on the A'REX link from Seoul Station or Incheon Airport, as well as subway lines 5 and 9.  All lines intersect Line 2 which runs in a large circle through Seoul. Line 9 (Gold Line), a private subway line in Seoul, has three express trains per hour. Travelers coming into Seoul should first have detailed directions to their destination from the nearest station then consult the subway map before deciding on which line and route to take. All three lines cost â©1,000-2,100 (depending on distance), while a taxi to central Seoul will run around â©30,000. Discounts for subway fare are available with T-Money cards.
Seoul is the northern terminus of the KTX high-speed line.  There are three KTX stations within city limits:
Nearly all ordinary (non-KTX) services also use one or both of the above terminals, but services east to <a href="/en/Chuncheon" title="Chuncheon">Chuncheon</a> or <a href="/en/Gangneung" title="Gangneung">Gangneung</a> and southeast to <a href="/en/Gyeongju" title="Gyeongju">Gyeongju</a> via <a href="/en/Danyang" title="Danyang">Danyang</a> use <b>Cheongnyangni Station</b> (ì²­ëë¦¬ì­), to the east of the city on line 1.
Every weekend approximately 2 million Seoulites leave the city, which goes a long way to explaining why the city has five major intercity bus terminals.
There are ferry services to various points in <a href="/en/China" title="China">China</a> from the neighboring port city of <a href="/en/Incheon" title="Incheon">Incheon</a>. Currently no services run from Japan directly to Seoul; many Koreans take the coach or KTX train to <a href="/en/Busan" title="Busan">Busan</a>, where several ferry and hydrofoil options are available.
No matter where in Korea you start your journey, there will be tolled expressways (Gosok Doro) and national highways (Gook Do) that lead to Seoul; the most important one is the Gyeongbu Expressway, linking Seoul with <a href="/en/Busan" title="Busan">Busan</a>. To avoid the daily traffic jam on the Gyeongbu Highway near Seoul, take Jungbu/2nd Jungbu, Seohaean, or Yongin-Seoul Expressway.
Traffic jams are all too common in Seoul, so be careful on the streets and head underground when possible.  Street and subway signage is usually written in English as well as Korean.
<br />
In Seoul, you can visit most places by using the subway system, the second most used metro transportation system in the world.  There are currently a total of 17 lines (nine numbered lines plus a smattering of named suburban lines), all distinguished by different colors.  All signs in the subway system are in Korean (both <i>hangeul</i> and if applicable, <i>hanja</i>) and English.  Most signs also have Japanese and Chinese written names.  The signs leading to the platform for a particular direction of travel on a given subway line typically list the names of a number of stations in that direction.  Stations each have a 3 digit number, but locals rarely make use of these numbers, and they're not on most subway maps, so don't rely on them. Be sure to search for updated subway maps as the Seoul metro system is constantly expanding and many maps even on the subway cars may not be the fully updated versions.  A subway map can be found here:<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://cfs5.tistory.com/upload_control/download.blog?fhandle=YmxvZzExODM3MkBmczUudGlzdG9yeS5jb206L2F0dGFjaC8wLzEuZ2lm">[5]</a>.
Subway fares are based on the distance traveled, but the shortest ride costs â©1,150 (base charge) plus card deposit â©500 (refundable if you return the card at designated machines at each station). The base charge roughly covers up to 10 km of the journey and â©100 is added for every 5 km beyond that. Cards can be purchased from vending machines ONLY. All vending machines accept coins and bills, up to â©10,000 notes (and some â©50,000 notes, but cash exchange machines are at each station).  Hang onto your card until the end of your trip, as you'll need it to get out. Most of Seoul's automated card machines are equipped with touchscreen and full English support (along with Chinese and Japanese). Since ticket machines may be crowded, buying two cards (one for each way) is recommended.
If planning on using the Metro extensively or staying for more than a few weeks, you should  consider purchasing a <b>T-money</b> stored value contact-less smart card.  You can buy this card at most subway stations and many newspaper kiosks near subway entrances, as well as convenience stores.  The card itself costs â©3000 and cash can be charged onto the card as often as you like.  When entering and leaving a subway turnstile, place the card on the reader (leaving it inside your purse or wallet is fine) and it will deduct the appropriate fare from the card.  Using this card will allow you to save â©100 on all transfers (these are common with Seoul's extensive subway system) and you can get all but â©500 back if you have unused credit.
Typically for most travelers staying less than 2 weeks in Seoul, purchasing this card may not be cheaper but other factors should be considered: it can also be used for taxi fares, buses, storage lockers, pay phones, etc. However, using a transportation card is highly recommended if you wish to use it for buses as well simply for its ability to transfer between them since you will not have to pay for the basic 1,100 fare twice for a single journey when using two modes of transport. It also saves the hassle from figuring out how much you need to pay or waiting in line to buy a single-use ticket.
The subway is not open 24 hours, so you may be stranded late at night.
Seoul also has a very well connected and extensive bus transportation service. There are four different kinds of buses: yellow, green, blue, and red and gyeonggi. Yellow buses have a short circuit usually around tourist areas. Green buses travel around neighborhoods and connect with the subway. Blue buses go across town, while red and green 'G' (Gyeonggi) buses are intercity buses. Buses will only stop at designated bus stops and will not wait for indecisive travelers.
Adult fare is as follows:
<b>Cash</b> &#8211; â©1,150
<b>T-Money Card</b> &#8211; â©1,050
Note that by using a T-Money card, you can transfer between the bus and the subway for free up to 30 minutes after your last scan. That is to say, the base charge of â©1,050 won't be charged twice. If, for example, you are travel 10 km by subway, transfer to a bus and travel a further 5 km, 1,050 won will be deducted once you leave the subway, nothing will be deducted when you enter a bus, but you will be deducted â©100 for the extra 5 km journey you made on the bus. Note that if you do not tag the machine as you leave the bus, you will be charged the maximum fare possible by the route.
The city of Seoul provides an interactive bus map at the following site: Seoul Public Transportation System Guide <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://bus.congnamul.com/SeoulRouteWebApp/view_english/map.jsp">[6]</a>.
There are many types of taxis in Seoul.  Standard taxis will be an orange or silver color while deluxe taxis are black with a yellow sign and are more expensive than regular taxis but provide better and more comfortable service. For the most part, regular taxi cabs have leather interiors and the drivers are nice--so, for many people, "regular" in Seoul might be "deluxe" in their hometown. It is easy to hail a taxi any time of the day or night along any relatively major Seoul street with bright LED lights in the front of the windshield to denote an available car (ë¹ì°¨) or off if the car is taken. If the LED screen denotes "ë¹ì°¨" it means it is available and if it denotes "ìì½", it means the taxi is en route to a previously arranged appointment through a call service which may be used without fee when needed.
You can call a deluxe taxi wherever you are by calling 3431-5100. Sometimes, you can find a visitor's guide taxi or an international taxis exclusively for foreigners, a kind of deluxe taxi, the drivers of which know English and Japanese and can guide you around Seoul.
The basic fare for regular taxis is â©2,400 (â©2,880 at night), with a surcharge of â©100 applied according to time and distance. (The basic fare is up to 2 km, plus â©100 per 144 m.) In deluxe taxis, the basic fare is â©4500 and the additional fare increases in increments of â©200. (â©4500 basic fare for up to 3 km, plus â©200 per 164 m). International taxi drivers speak at least one foreign language (generally English) fluently.  International taxis use the same basic fare as regular taxis, plus an additional 20%.
If there is more than one passenger, and you are traveling only a short distance (like 1-2 metro stops) it is usually cheaper to catch a taxi than to take a bus or subway.
In general, taxi drivers do not speak English or any other foreign language, so have your destination written in Korean to show to the taxi driver. It is also wise to get your hotel's business card in case you get lost. Some may even reject looking at a map so whenever possible, have the location written in Korean.
All taxis advertise a free interpretation service that can be called if you need help. The phone number for the interpretation is on the window sticker of the back seats. Taxis that have an "On Base Authorized" sticker on the side, or a green sticker on their front bumper, are capable of entering US military bases in Seoul. These drivers are required to speak better English as part of their contract and may thus be easier for any English speaking tourists.
Most taxis accept credit cards and T-money cards and thus have a V-shaped orange card sign on the roof of the taxi by the front passenger seat window. However, drivers generally prefer that you pay cash, especially for short rides.
You can also ask for your receipt ("Yeong-su-jeung" ììì¦).
As in any other  city, there are some bad apples, and some drivers may take you the long way. Although the drivers often have a GPS device on the dashboard of their car, this is relatively meaningless if you do not know the area or cannot speak sufficient Korean to argue the point.  Korean taxi drivers have been known to take "the long way" when arriving to destinations when the passenger seems to be oblivious as to how to arrive at the respective destination.  Therefore, it is important to be tough-minded to keep the driver in check and to make sure he knows where the destination is.  However, you will have no problem getting to a destination if you have an accurate address as no place in Korea is unreachable due to its immaculate GPS systems.
In general, make sure the driver turns on the meter, get an idea of the cardinal direction of your destination (north, south, east, west), and use the interpretation service if you want to agree to a fare beforehand.  Meters are standard in every taxi in Korea and it is illegal to haggle for a negotiated fare.
However, keep in mind that there is often road construction or protests around Seoul, so sometimes a long route is necessary. If you suspect you are being ripped off, the most a non-Korean speaker can do is write down or take a picture of the driver's ID (located above the glove box) and report the details to the company.  Also, make sure to get into the taxi first then tell the driver of your destination as it is illegal and grounds for prosecution if a driver refuses to take passengers once they have entered the vehicle.
Internationally known car rental companies like Hertz are in Seoul, just be prepared for a driving challenge and long rush hours. In addition, parking spaces are hard, if not close to impossible to find, especially during peak hours. Therefore, unless you are planning to head out of the city, it is not advisable to rent a car and you are better off relying on the excellent public transport system instead.
Getting around in Seoul without a local escort (be it friend or cab driver) can be tricky, since this is one of the most densely populated cities in the world. While Seoul occupies less land than New York City, it can be more confusing. The major roads twist and turn, the various rail lines, rivers and mountains are obstacles and the smaller roads turn into a labyrinth of alleys. Most people will try to help you find your way around but often won't know themselves; best to familiarize yourself with some landmarks and the nearest subway stations. Learn the landmarks closest to where you are staying. The better-known landmarks in Seoul (such as the N Seoul Tower located in the center of town)can prove helpful at times. A compass will still work when a GPS fails.
Once you know your immediate surroundings, you'll find that Seoul isn't such a huge place and the pedestrian approach can be an enriching experience.
There's usually a subway stop within a ten-minute walk in any direction.
Whether on bicycle or foot, the best way to escape traffic is to learn the rivers and streams. Most of these waterways empty into the Han River or another tributary to the Han, so look to the direction of water flow at any creek; chances are, it's headed for the Han. The Han runs right through town, generally moving West (sometimes Southwest; sometimes Northwest), so knowing where you are in relation to the Han is helpful.
The Han River as well as most streams are lined with massive parks that feature outdoor gymnasiums, multiple-lane bicycle paths, and 24-hour restrooms. Cars are generally not allowed. Pedestrian bridges on the smaller waterways are common.
Numerous mountains with hiking trails can be found in the city.
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<i>See also: <a href="/en/Korean_phrasebook" title="Korean phrasebook">Korean phrasebook</a></i><br />
As elsewhere in Korea, a grasp of basic <a href="/en/Korean_phrasebook" title="Korean phrasebook">Korean</a> will be helpful. If you plan on an extended visit, consider learning to read the Korean written script, hangeul. It takes very little time to pick up the basics, and it can be endlessly helpful.  A quick (free) visit to the Story of King Sejong Exhibition Hall beneath the Statue of King Sejong in Gwanghwamun Square will give you an introduction to the Korean written language and some interactive exhibits to practice.  Thirty minutes there will see you recognising and pronouncing some Korean words.
Shops in major tourists areas, including Insadong, Myeongdong, and Itaewon, will probably have staff that speak at least some English, and some may have staff that speak Mandarin, Cantonese and/or Japanese. While all younger Koreans are required to study English in school, due to a lack of practice, proficiency is generally poor, and most residents of Seoul only know a few simple words and phrases. If lost, a useful tip is to write down your question in simple words and show it to someone young. That being said, it is still possible to get by using only English, though it goes without saying that a basic grasp of Korean will make your trip much smoother.
As the ancient seat of Korea's royalty, there are no fewer than 5 major palaces in Seoul, and some are definitely worth a visit. You can pay admission fee with T-money at the entrance(no additional discount applies). ISIC holder can get a discount at ticket office.
Seoul offers many excellent opportunities for hiking. The mountains in Seoul are at most 800 m (3,000 ft), accessible by public transit and the trails range from easy to difficult.
Saunas generally take the form of public baths in Korea, and are a popular form of relaxation. Services such as hair cuts and shoe cleaning are generally available. Some saunas also include sleeping areas for overnight stay. These are known as ì°ì§ë°©, or <i>jimjilbang</i>, and can be a cheap alternative to hotels when you're just passing through an area.
Korea's cuisine is known the world over for being healthy and spicy. Learning how to make Korean dishes such as kimchi and bulgogi can be messy, but a lot of fun. Fortunately, there are several cooking institutes throughout Seoul catering to foreign tourists.
<br />
Korean ceramics are known around the world for their simple beauty unique designs. Visitors can learn how to make pottery at the National Museum of Korea and the pottery villages just outside of Seoul in Incheon and Yeoju.
There is an immense demand for ESL (<i>English as a Second Language</i>) instruction in Seoul.  See the main <a href="/en/South_Korea#Work" title="South Korea">South Korea</a> article for details.
Note that Seoul municipal government has decided to phase out foreign (<i>non-Korean</i>) teachers of English in all public schools. Although it has yet to be seen if this will be successful in practice, it may have an effect on your options in Seoul. Positions in private schools are still available. It is recommended to obtain a job through a reputable recruiter to avoid sketchy hagwons. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.eslstarter.com">ESL Starter</a> is often recommended for private school jobs in Korea.
Fashion shopping in Seoul isn't a mere industry, it's an art form.
<b>Myeongdong</b>, is probably the largest and best-known area; it is definitely the most tourist-friendly fashion area.  In the spring and summer, fashion models/sidewalk promoters can be seen strolling the streets of Myeongdong promoting various cosmetics, stores or other fashion-related products.  Many regular people also tend to catwalk their newest outfit on these streets.  Rows of stores are available to look for that perfect accessory, and most of Korea's major brands can be found here: mVIO, Caspi Conus, WhoAU California, AHM, So.Basic, Noxon, Basic House, UGIZ, 1492, nipper, hang ten, A6, Bean Pole, Jambangee, Giordano as well as a few international brands such as Lacoste, Land Rover, Adidas, Gap, Zara, Koolhaas, Uniqlo, Anna Sui, and Forever 21.
<b>Apgujeong</b> (ìêµ¬ì ), widely known as "The Beverly Hills of Seoul" is the land of luxury, brand name goods. International brands like Chanel, Louis Vuitton, Dior, Gucci and Prada sit alongside Korean designer brands.
Near the <b>Cheongdam</b> Intersection lies the heart of the Korean shoe scene. Cutting edge shoe shops include <b>Sue Comma Bonnie</b>, <b>Hyaang</b>, <b>Heels</b> and <b>Namuhana</b>.
Trends often begin in University areas like <b>Hongdae</b>. Hongik University boasts Korea's most famous art school, thus fashion in this area is often influenced by the students' artistic sensibilities. The shops in this area feature funky, punky, boho, and vintage style. Ewha Women's University also has a big shopping area in front of itâs main gate, as do many of the Women's colleges. Many trends also originate here. There are even seamstresses who can help you make your own designs come to life.
Won, Yen and US dollars are accepted, along with major credit cards. Most shops have staff who can speak Japanese. There are duty-free shops in both the Incheon airport and the major department stores: Lotte, Shilla Hotel. There are other duty-free shops at Walkerhill Hotel, SKM DFS in COEX Mall.
Much of Korean social life revolves around food and the city is packed with restaurants, so it would take a determined man to starve to death in Seoul.  This fate may still befall you if you insist on English menus and meals consisting only of easily identifiable, familiar ingredients, so see <a href="/en/South_Korea#Eat" title="South Korea">South Korea#Eat</a> for a quick Korean menu reader.  An alternative is to just point and eat, your hosts generally will accommodate. If you look in the right places, a good meal (lunch or dinner) including side dishes can cost â©5,000 or less (try basements of large department stores).
In addition to Korean food, Japanese restaurants in Seoul tend to be excellent, featuring excellent sushi and sashimi. Chinese restaurants exist, but are typically adapted to suit local preferences.  There are a few Italian restaurants; these are generally excellent, with chefs trained in Italy, although flavors tend to be more or less Koreanized, with sugar in the garlic bread and meatballs.
Bakeries are found throughout, including some of the common big chains.
Seoul has plenty of budget places to eat. Everything from convenience store junk food and noodles to street stall food and lots of 24 hr Korean fast food restaurants. The 24-hour restaurants are great because they've usually got a wide variety of foods, including: mandu, odeng, dokbokki, naengmyeon, udon and ramyeon. Prices do vary from about â©2,000-9,000 at these restaurants. Also open late into the night are Korean BBQ restaurants, which are everywhere in Seoul.  These can be very cheap and are usually of good quality.  Barbecue options usually are limited to pork and beef, and they often come with a smattering of side dishes. Korean BBQ is, in itself, an experience that makes you feel like a Seoulite. The larger department stores in the city have basement food courts that offer excellent food (not recommended if you care about atmosphere).
Seoul features a mind-bogglingly large array of nightspots catering to every taste and budget, often being considered the best and most vibrant in the world. While most cities feature only a few areas for nightlife, Seoul features many such districts in staggering size and array of locations to choose from.  Not only the sheer volume of bars and restaurants but also the relatively low cost of soju (the number one alcohol sold in the world) attributes to the lively nightlife atmosphere in the city.

Many bars in Itaewon celebrate Thursdays as Ladies' Night, which often means that women drink free before 12am. There are also a few gay bars located two alleys east of the main street, with a mix of clubs and places to drink.
For some good house/trance music, try some places such as:
Sinchon (ì ì´), home to universities including Sogang University(ìê°ëíêµ), Yonsei University (ì°ì¸ëíêµ) and Ewha Womans University, is a great place to soak up a more Korean environment. Not to be confused with Sincheon, which is closer to Jamshil, Sinchon is set up like many Korean entertainment areas in which bars, clubs, restaurants, karaoke boxes and sometimes even motels are structured in a grid-like fashion. The only way to familiarize yourself with the area is to stroll the alleys and discover all of the different places. Korean bars tend to be rather anti-social compared with their Western counterparts, with people sitting at tables with friends and not tending to mix. Yet a number of Western-style bars in the area have opened up.
Hongdae (íë), short for Hongik University, is the premier club area in Seoul by far. Located around Hongik University, clubs and bars are strewn everywhere around the place. The clubs aren't near the station but aren't hard to find. The most popular clubs are:
<span class='vcard' id = 'Miroir'><span class="fn org">Miroir</span>, <span class="adr"><span class="street-address">405-5, Seokyo-dong, Mapo-gu</span></span> (<span class="note directions">From exit 4 at Hapjeong station walk in the direction that the traffic flows, when you reach the fake airplane towards the minimart on your right, follow this road (watch out for taxis creeping from behind), turn right at main crossing, follow until you see Family Mart</span>). <span class="description">Psychedelic hippie hangout with psytrance Fri and Sat, 60s and 70s rock during the week.  No cover charge.</span> &#160;<a class="listing-edit" href="#Miroir" onclick="editListing('Miroir', 'drink', 'Seoul');return false;" title="click to edit Miroir" rel="nofollow">edit</a></span>
Some other popular clubs include
On a Friday or Saturday expect all of these to be packed tight. Last Friday of every month is <b>Club Day</b> where â©15,000 will get you into those clubs who are part of the "Club Day". Expect a packed crowd. A number of bars are popular with foreigners here too:
The place is huge and you could party for a whole week in all the bars and clubs. The best way to see it is to stroll around and find something you like. An interesting note: the entire club district of Hongdae is officially off-limits to U.S. military personnel, Federal employees and their dependents. However, it is not unusual to see crew-cuts here on the weekends since it is rarely enforced.
In warmer months, don't pass up the closet-sized <b>B-Dan</b> on Hongdae's main strip, which offers up take-out draft beer by the plastic cup.
More recently, a number of LP bars playing classic rock and pop has opened up. One to look for is <b>Suzie Q</b>, which is near the 7-11 around the clubs.
Apgujeong (ìêµ¬ì ) is the upmarket area of Seoul. Walk around the streets and you'll see teenagers valet parking their new Benz or Audi, strutting their new designer threads, and looking generally, well, rich. That said, a lot of people who party here aren't necessarily rich and live far away. Apgujeong is rather subdued when it comes to nightlife though it has a few posh clubs and bars. Places where valet is unavailable are unlikely to be great hits traditionally. There are, however, a few small clubs in the area. Expect English to be more commonly spoken in this area, too, due many Koreans in the area having studied abroad or received a lot of private tutoring. This has also meant, however, a certain desensitization to foreigners, so don't expect people to stare or approach you as much as they would in other parts of Seoul. Consider Apgujeong a great place to hang out, not party. If you want to impress a date for example, this is a great place to go to. The backstreets of Apgujeong tend to sprout and lose new clubs seemingly at random throughout the year, so getting off the main drag from time to time can yield a new "hot club of the month."
Gangnam station (ê°ë¨) is probably the No. 2 club area in Seoul. Also set up in a grid structure, clubs, bars, restaurants and other entertainment venues decorate this upmarket location. While not as upmarket as Apgujeong, it definitely is busy and lively. If Apgujeong is the place for rich kids to hang out and look cool, Gangnam is the place for those rich kids to party and look sexy. The station is a transit hub and a ton of buses run through the heart of the entertainment area, so finding your way there is extremely easy.
<i>Note</i>: Certain entertainment districts, such as Hongdae, are off-limits to American military personnel, U.S. government employees, contractors and their dependents.
Seoul's has two unofficial backpacker districts, <b>Jongno</b> (Anguk/Sinseol-dong) to the northeast of the city and <b>Hongdae, Sinchon</b> out to the west.  Within walking distance to Dongdaemun Market, Jongno is better located for sightseeing and can be reached directly from Incheon Airport on limousine buses or city bus 6002 to <i>Sinseol-dong</i> stop (â©9,000, 90 min).
Hongdae, Sinchon area is loacated in university area. Yonsei Univ., Ehwa woman's Univ., Hongik Univ. and Sogang Univ. are around this area. so there are many restaurants, bar, club and shopping center and easy to be reached from Incheon Airport by limousine bus and Arex (Airport express train) in 1 hour

Alternatively, try a <i><a href="/en/South_Korea#Sleep" title="South Korea">jjimjilbang</a></i>. You don't get a room of your own, but you can store your luggage into one of the small lockers and you can live quite cheaply for a long time, sleeping in the public sleeping rooms and enjoying the hot-tub and steam room facilities (sometimes a gym is available, also movies and TV shows often play until 11PM or so). To find a jjimjilbang keep an eye out for the the words jjimjilbang (ì°ì§ë°©) or 24 hr sauna (24ì ì¬ì°ë) in Korean. Not all saunas have jjimjilbang stay-over facilities to watch out for that.  â©4,000-12,000/night.
The staff are friendly, but the desk is not manned 24 hours a day as advertised. Also, the conditions in the annex are vastly different from the ones in the actual guesthouse (mentioned above). The annex is a pig's sty - the kitchen is just a constantly clogged sink and a fridge, and the bathroom is dirty and unheated in the winter. Make absolutely sure that you book a room in the actual guesthouse (and not the annex), and don't let them bait and switch you to an annex room (which they're known to do).

Seoul's top-end hotels are impressive, but pricey.
Console gaming (Xbox 360, PS3) is widely available, and for those with proficiency in Korean language, you might also be able to enjoy a round of online gaming; the fantasy MMORPG <i>Lineage</i> was created in Korea and a slew of MMORPG titles not available anywhere else can be found here.
Useful contact numbers are as follows:
Seoul is a remarkably safe city given its size, comparable in safety to Hong Kong or Tokyo. Pickpocketing is not very common and violent crime is minimal if almost unheard of.
If you happen to be a non-Korean male walking hand-in-hand with a Korean female, drunk older Korean men might give you a tongue lashing or occasionally worse. Note that this is far less of a problem than it used to be.
If you do end up in a fight, remember that Korean law is possibly different to your home country. Just because someone else started the fight does not provide you with legal protection if the attacker ends up hurt. As in anywhere else in the world, get out of such a situation as quickly as you can.
U.S. military personnel now have a curfew 1am-5am 7 days a week on the Korean Peninsula, although the curfew can be extended at very short notice. If you are a westerner then the American Military Police may request to see your ID and, if you refuse, may summon the Korean National Police, who have the right to demand it.  (<i>This is done to catch American military personel breaking the curfews</i>)
Unfortunately crimes by American soldiers against Koreans do happen, and when they do they often receive a huge amount of national attention. If you are a westerner then you should exercise some extra care when such a case hits the media, although it is still highly unlikely you would be in any danger.
Large scale demonstration in Seoul against the government happen from time to time. Often they can result in a riot where there are pitched battles between protesters and riot police. People do get seriously hurt, so try and avoid getting too close to the action.
Over the last 15-20 years Korea has undergone a major English language boom. Korean families are eager for their children to learn English and commonly place them in private language schools. English is also a compulsory subject in public school from elementary grades on. Nowadays, a large number of high school aged to young adult Koreans on the street will have at least a rudimentary grasp of English.
However, note with caution that the majority of Koreans will speak little English if not none at all, particularly the older generations. A few tourist information centers dotted around Seoul are staffed by English speakers, but by and large the average service provider will not speak English.
English signage is visible everywhere in the city, from road signs to subway maps to shop posters.
Pharmacies are everywhere in Seoul.  While most are labeled only in Korean, the signage and Hangul character is easy to recognize: ì½.   Most pharmacists speak some English. Pharmacists are not shy about asking about your symptoms and selling you what they think you need.
Medical bills can be expensive, but not too, so make sure you have valid <a href="/en/Travel_insurance" title="Travel insurance">travel insurance</a>.
Some people with sensitive stomachs should use caution when dining in Korea as some of the local cuisine is heavily spiced with copious amounts of pepper and garlic.
Air quality in Seoul is questionable, at best. Part of this comes from China, but plenty of pollution comes from Korean industries and the growing number of automobiles on the road. When approaching Metro-Seoul via train a visible dome of smog exists. Asthmatics frequently have acute problems, especially in the low-lying areas of town. Pharmacies carry a variety of different allergy and smog masks and are a common sight outdoors.
Mold is very common during the hotter months and the rainy season. While it is pervasive nearest the rivers and streams, many subway stations reek of mildew and mold.
Mongolian Yellow Dust Storms, in Spring, have always been considered dangerous, but more so in recent years, as these storms blow across China's industrial belt, picking up toxins, before sweeping across the Korean Peninsula. Efforts to mitigate the dust storms included a donation of several thousand trees from South Korea to China. The Chinese accepted the trees, then planted them along highways, rather than as a barrier for the dust storms. When dust storms come through Seoul, it is common for local inhabitants to put on mask specifically for dust storms and make haste to the nearest enclosure. Some locals will refuse to travel when Yellow Dust Storms are present.
The Korean Peninsula is the political hotspot of Northeast Asia, hence, a large number of embassies are located in Seoul.
Mostly, Koreans are very curious about foreigners. Many will gawk and glare while others will try out their English. For the most part, Koreans are very friendly on the street and will take great pains to be helpful, despite the above attitudes.
If working in Korea, one should do a little reading on Confucianism and how it translates into social standing.
