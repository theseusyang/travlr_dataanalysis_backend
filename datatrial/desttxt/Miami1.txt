<b>Miami</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.miamigov.com/cms/">[1]</a> is a major city in the south-eastern <a href="/en/United_States" title="United States" class="mw-redirect">United States</a> and makes up part of the largest metropolitan area in <a href="/en/Florida" title="Florida">Florida</a>. Being part of the <a href="/en/South_Florida" title="South Florida">South Florida</a> region, it is 20 miles from <a href="/en/Fort_Lauderdale" title="Fort Lauderdale">Fort Lauderdale</a>, 106 miles from <a href="/en/Naples_(Florida)" title="Naples (Florida)">Naples (Florida)</a> and 156 miles from <a href="/en/Key_West" title="Key West">Key West</a>.
Although tourists generally consider <b><a href="/en/Miami_Beach" title="Miami Beach">Miami Beach</a></b> to be part of Miami, it is in actuality its own municipality. Located on a barrier island east of Miami and Biscayne Bay, it is home to a large number of beach resorts and is one of the most popular spring break party destinations in the world.
Although Miami is the second most populous city in Florida, the Miami metropolitan area is the largest in the state with an estimated population of over 5.4 million (2007), which makes it the 7th most populous metro area in the United States. Due to being sandwiched in by the Atlantic Ocean to the east and the Everglades wetland area to the west, the Miami metropolitan area is a lengthy 110 mi(180 km) north to south, but never more than 20 mi (32 km) east to west.
Flaglerâs railroad sparked a wave of expansion in areas such as Miami Beach, Homestead and Cutler. Soon after the railroad was built, the Overseas Highway was created. This highway connected the Florida Keys to the mainland. Growth and progress in Miami continued through World War I as well as into the mid-1920s.
A devastating hurricane in 1926 halted Miamiâs growth and temporarily put the city, as well as Miami Beach, in a recession. It was the cityâs support of President Franklin Delano Rooseveltâs New Deal that helped the city rebuild. Roosevelt almost lost his life, however, when Giuseppe Zangara attempted to assassinate Roosevelt when he came to Miami to thank the city for its support of the New Deal.
When a German U-boat sank a US tanker off Floridaâs coast, the majority of South Florida was converted into military headquarters for the remainder of World War II. The Armyâs WWII legacy in Miami is a school designed for Anti U-boat warfare.
Because of its low latitude Miami has a subtropical savanna climate. There are two seasons in Miami, a warm and dry season from November through mid April....and a hot and wet season from May through October. The wet or summer months of June-September will see most daytime highs in the upper 80's F with lows in the low to mid 70's with high humidity. The coldest winter months from December through March have highs in the upper 70's and lows near 60 F, with sunny and dry weather with often very low humidity. At times winter can be quite dry with water restrictions and cold snaps. Miami has the warmest ocean surf after Honolulu in the United States annually - reaching 85 F in summer and 75 F in winter.
<br />
Miami has the largest Latin American population outside of Latin America. English however remains the official language, and English should be attempted first when approaching a local out of respect to native residents.
Spanish is a language often used for day-to-day discourse in many places, although English is the language of preference, especially when dealing with business and government. Some locals do not speak English, but this is usually centered among shops and restaurants in residential communities and rarely the case in large tourist areas or the downtown district. Even when encountering a local who does not speak English, you can easily find another local to help with translation if needed, since most of the population is fluently bilingual. In certain neighborhoods, such as Little Havana and <a href="/en/Hialeah" title="Hialeah">Hialeah</a>, most locals will address a person first in Spanish and then in English. "Spanglish", a mixture of English and Spanish, is a somewhat common occurrence (but less so than in the <a href="/en/Southwest_(United_States_of_America)" title="Southwest (United States of America)">American Southwest</a>), with bilingual locals switching between English and Spanish mid-sentence and occasionally replacing a common English word for its Spanish equivalent.
<a href="/en/Haitian_Creole_phrasebook" title="Haitian Creole phrasebook">Haitian Creole</a> is another language heard primarily in northern Miami. It is common for a person to hear a conversation in Creole when riding public transportation or sitting at a restaurant. Many signs and public announcements are in English, Spanish and Creole because of Miami's diverse immigrant population. Unlike Spanish, Haitian Creole is generally centered among the Haitian neighborhoods in northern Miami. Most Haitians are more adapted to English than their Hispanic neighbors. <a href="/en/Portuguese_phrasebook" title="Portuguese phrasebook">Portuguese</a> and <a href="/en/French_phrasebook" title="French phrasebook">French</a> are other languages that may be encountered in Miami. These languages tend to be spoken mainly around tourist areas. Most speakers of these languages speak English as well.
The simplest way to get a response in English is to use the "approach rule," where most locals will respond only in the language spoken to unless they are not able to speak it. This rule can be used on anyone whether or not their first language is Spanish, English or any other language.
<b>Miami International Airport</b> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICAO" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:ICAO">ICAO</a>: <b>KMIA</b>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IATA" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:IATA">IATA</a>: <b>MIA</b>) <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.miami-airport.com">[4]</a> is located just west of the city in an unincorporated suburban area. It is an important hub for traffic between Europe, North America and Latin America. The international traffic makes MIA a large and congested place. Be sure to allow extra time when departing MIA, particularly if flying internationally, as you may face an hour-long line just to check your bags. Curbside check-in is an excellent idea.
If you are approaching or leaving MIA via the Airport Expressway (Florida State Road 112), beware of the at-grade railroad crossing on the ramps connecting the Expressway to the airport terminals.  Normally such crossings are grade-separated, but this one sits directly east of one of the runways. Thus, be prepared for the possibility of a 10-15 minute delay if a train happens to be there at the same time as you.
Opa-Locka Executive(ICAO: KOPF) is popular for general aviation and business jet travelers out of the Miami area. Air taxi and air charter companies such as <b>Jetset Charter</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.jscharter.com">[5]</a> fly a variety of private charter aircraft and jets, from charter luxury Gulfstreams down to economical piston twins for small groups and individuals.
The predominant carrier at MIA is <a href="/en/American_Airlines" title="American Airlines">American Airlines</a>, which has direct flights to most major cities in the Americas, and several European cities as well. European, Latin-American and Caribbean carriers are well-represented at MIA. The airport has no non-stop service to Asia, Africa or Oceania.  The recent construction of two new terminals at MIA has helped with the airport's passenger capacities as well as the efficiency in going through customs and baggage claim.
MIA also has several restaurants ranging from local chains such as La Carreta to national chains such as Dunkinâ Donuts, Burger King and Starbucks. Be aware that some restaurants serve beer, wine and/or cocktails. If you drink too much the airlines can refuse your boarding on a plane. MIA also has several retail stores, including several magazine stands and bookstores (including a Borders). Other retail stores include, but are not limited to, Brookstone, K-B Toys and Ron Jon Surf Shop. There is also a hotel connected to the airport.
Money can be exchanged for US dollars at the airport. Wireless internet is also available at MIA for a small fee.
<b>Fort Lauderdale International Airport</b> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IATA" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:IATA">IATA</a>: <b>FLL</b>) <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.fll.net">[6]</a> is 25-40 minutes north of Miami proper, depending on traffic, and does not have nearly as many international routes. It only offers a small variety. However, it is smaller and less trafficked than MIA, making customs, immigration and security a bit easier to go through. Southwest Airlines, JetBlue and other low-cost carriers generally use Miami's other airport, FLL, instead of MIA, making FLL a cheaper alternative in many cases as well.
Public transport is available to MIA and FLL. If you are  arriving from FLL, there is a free shuttle to the Tri-Rail nearby <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.tri-rail.com">[7]</a> train station. Tri-Rail trains connect <a href="/en/West_Palm_Beach" title="West Palm Beach">West Palm Beach</a>, <a href="/en/Boca_Raton" title="Boca Raton">Boca Raton</a>, <a href="/en/Fort_Lauderdale" title="Fort Lauderdale">Fort Lauderdale</a> and Miami (note that this leaves you at the Miami Airport station, not downtown Miami).  The cheapest way to get to Miami is to take the #1 Broward County Bus to Aventura Mall and transfer to the <i>S</i> Miami-Dade bus to downtown Miami via South Beach. The 93 also goes to Miami from Aventura Mall. This option is inadvisable if traveling with a lot of luggage.
At MIA, public transportation includes a free shuttle to the nearby Tri-Rail station, as well as to Metrorail <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.miamidade.gov/transit">[8]</a> and Metromover <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.miamidade.gov/transit">[9]</a>. Your best option is to take a taxi from the airport or rent a car, depending on what your stay involves (if you need to get around parts of Miami with no nearby Metrorail stations). MIA's car rental facilities are scattered around the airport and connected to the terminal by shuttle buses. FLL's facilities are more conveniently located in the parking garage adjacent to the terminals.
Also, riders can take the recently created 150 express bus if they are staying in Miami Beach. Or, they can transfer from the 150 (or the J or #238 bus, which charges a slightly cheaper $2 fare as opposed to a $2.35 fare) to the MetroRail at the Earlington Heights station. From there, riders can take the MetroRail to various places, including Government Center in Downtown Miami, where transfers are available to buses to most destinations. Many hotels are along the MetroMover which is one level down from the MetroRail Government Center station. Consult a map for the closest MetroMover station or bus route to your hotel. 
Also, riders can take the J or 150 bus to Biscayne Boulevard and transfer to a southbound bus to <a href="/en/Downtown_Miami" title="Downtown Miami" class="mw-redirect">Downtown Miami</a>.
<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.miami-airport.com/bus_and_rail_info.asp">[10]</a>
Currently at MIA, construction of the new Miami Intermodal Center is slated to become Miami's Grand Central station with hub connections of Amtrak <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.amtrak.com">[11]</a>, Metrorail, Tri-Rail, taxis, Metrobus <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.miamidade.gov/transit">[12]</a>, and all car-rental facilities. The M.I.C. is expected to be completed around 2012.
Miami offers different fare types for different amounts of rides. Beware that unless you purchase an EASY Card or EASY Ticket, you will have to pay twice in order to transfer between buses and between the bus and MetroRail.  The full list of available fares can be found at <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.miamidade.gov/transit/fares_schedule.asp">http://www.miamidade.gov/transit/fares_schedule.asp</a>
EASY Cards and EASY Tickets can be bought at Terminal E of MIA.

Amtrak's <b>Silver Service</b> operates two trains daily to Miami from <a href="/en/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York City</a>, <a href="/en/Washington,_D.C." title="Washington, D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> and other cities along the Eastern Seaboard. The ride from New York is about 24 hours but is often subject to delays, as Amtrak uses poorer-quality freight lines south of Washington and must cope with slow freight trains along the way.
There are frequent (at least 1 per hour) Tri-Rail trains every day to Miami from <a href="/en/West_Palm_Beach" title="West Palm Beach">West Palm Beach</a>, <a href="/en/Boca_Raton" title="Boca Raton">Boca Raton</a> and <a href="/en/Fort_Lauderdale" title="Fort Lauderdale">Fort Lauderdale</a> on weekdays. However, on the weekends, the trains come every 2 hours. The weekday fare varies by distance but the weekend fare is $4 between any two stations on the line.
There are three main highways coming into Miami. <b>I-95</b> runs along the Atlantic coast of the United States and terminates in Miami. <b>I-75</b> comes in from the midwestern United States and runs through <a href="/en/Atlanta" title="Atlanta">Atlanta</a> and <a href="/en/Tampa" title="Tampa">Tampa</a> before terminating in Miami. <b>Florida's Turnpike</b> is a toll road mainly useful for those driving in from <a href="/en/Orlando" title="Orlando">Orlando</a>. The only southbound route from Miami is <b><a href="/en/U.S._Highway_1" title="U.S. Highway 1">U.S. Highway 1</a></b>, which runs through the <a href="/en/Florida_Keys" title="Florida Keys">Florida Keys</a> all the way to <a href="/en/Key_West" title="Key West">Key West</a>.
Miami's public transit system is the most diverse and extensive of any locality in Florida. In short, if travel time is not a priority, it is possible to travel to all commercial areas and major attractions within Miami without a car.
Miami's bus system covers the entire county and connects to bus lines serving Broward County and the Greater Fort Lauderdale area. Recent developments have made the bus system more reliable than in the past. Even with the changes, and because of high local traffic, buses tend to have a hard time remaining on schedule. However, buses run often enough through each route so as not to be a nuisance. Many of the major bus routes operate 24 hours a day, seven days week, including the Route S bus, which connects downtown Miami to all of Miami Beach, terminating at Avenutra Mall in north Miami-Dade.
The <b>Metrorail</b> is a dual line, Green and Orange Line, elevated rail system serving Miami and surrounding cities, running 24.9 mi with 23 stations. It connects many areas of tourist interest, including downtown Miami, Miami International Airport (Orange Line - Only)Dadeland Mall, Vizcaya Museum and Gardens, Lowe Art Museum, Miami Museum of Science, Village at Merrick Park and many other nearby shopping areas. Coconut Grove and downtown <a href="/en/Coral_Gables" title="Coral Gables">Coral Gables</a> can be reached via short shuttle bus from various stations. Metrorail operates between roughly 5AM and midnight, with a bus serving all Metrorail stations operating in the overnight hours, effectively providing 24-hour service.
Recently, state and federal funding has allowed for planned expansions to the Metrorail to take better shape. A connection to Miami International Airport started construction in late 2009, opened July 2012.
Metrorail Green Line runs from Palmetto Station to Dadeland South with Orange Line trains traveling from Miami International Airport to Dadeland South. Both lines service the main trunk line from Earlington Heights Station to Dadeland South. Main line trunk service operates from 5AM to Midnight, seven days a week. Trains run  as frequently as every 5 minutes to as infrequently as every 15 minutes along the main trunk. Mid-Day Weekday service along the main trunk averages seven minute service.
Fare for a single trip on both Metrorail and Metrobus is $2 per ride ($1 for persons with disabilities or on Medicare). Day, weekly, and monthly pass are available. In early 2010, Miami-Dade Transit implemented a fare card system known as EASY Card. Though exact change/cash is still accepted on all Metrobus routes, an EASY Card is required for riding the Metrorail, and for utilizing the free transfers offered between an unlimited number of bus routes, and a single Metrorail ride. Currently, the fare card software does not allow passbacks. Any remaining transit tokens you may have can no longer be exchanged for EASY Card credit, and are not accepted as fare. Additional information on fares, routes and schedules can be found at <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.miamidade.gov/transit/">[19]</a>, or by calling +1 305 770-3131.
Downtown Miami is served by a free elevated people mover system known as <b>Metromover</b>, which connects to Metrorail at two stations at Government Center in the central business district and at Brickell Station in Brickell. Metromover is free of charge and is the most efficient way to move around Downtown Miami. It is a great way to take a rest when walking around downtown, and a great time to take pictures of the skyscrapers and growing Miami skyline from above.
<b>South Floridaâs Regional Transportation Authority (SFRTA) </b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.tri-rail.com/">[20]</a>, or by calling +1 800 tri-rail. There are frequent tri rails (at least one per an hour) to one of the four major destinations, Broward County, Miami-Dade County, Palm Beach County and South Florida Education Center (SFEC)/ Davie Campus Transit Routes. Each of these four destinations have many different stops. Be sure to check the website for each stop and a schedule. There are employer discount programs on the website as well as fares.
Taxis are generally expensive with a surcharge of $2.50 for the pick-up and an additional $0.40 for each sixth of a mile traveled. Almost all cab companies in the area have pre-determined rates for travel into the barrier islands of Miami Beach and other beach and nightclub communities popular with tourists which can range from $30-$60 depending on arrival location. For example, South Beach may be the most expensive while a residential neighborhood in Miami Beach may be the cheapest. The charge is the same regardless of pick-up location on the mainland. All taxis are fitted with maps of the barrier islands which state the cost per location. The same applies for passengers leaving the islands onto the mainland, though normal rates apply for person traveling by taxi within the islands or within the mainland.
Service is available throughout Miami-Dade, Broward, Palm Beach, and Monroe counties regardless of pick-up location. The normal service charges apply for these four counties, but it is wise to ask for a pre-determined price beforehand if leaving the county as this will in most cases turn out to be cheaper and most drivers are willing to negotiate when leaving the county. If you wish to be taxied to a location outside of those four counties, you must negotiate a price and advise the cab company first. Drivers may refuse to drive outside of the metropolitan area if they are not advised to do so beforehand.
Usually you will have to call a cab company and request a pick-up. Taxis operated by the major companies are <b>not normally allowed to pick up passengers at random locations for safety and legal reasons</b> except at MIA, the Port of Miami and train stations. Some individual taxi drivers will not follow this rule, however. You can try hailing a taxi in the street. A significant and notable exception to this rule is the South Beach section of Miami Beach. For all intents and purposes, taxis can be flagged from the street on the island in a very similar way to what one might expect in New York City. This trend has begun spreading into the downtown area of Miami, but is primarily due to the increased redevelopment and foot traffic downtown, and should not be relied upon if you have a schedule to keep.
<b>All taxi drivers must have a valid license to operate</b>. It is uncommon to hear of crimes involving unlicensed taxis anywhere in the metropolitan area since Dade County keeps track of all taxi activity in and around Miami and cooperates with other counties in getting this information. If you enter a cab and do not see a valid license placed in front of the passenger's seat, you should not enter the taxi and instead call another cab company regardless of what the driver says. If you willingly enter a taxi without a license or with an expired license and there is an incident or accident, it is possible that you may not be able to hold the driver accountable by law. When entering a cab you should make note of the driver's name, license number and cab number if any problems arise during the trip. This information should be easily found inside the taxi.It may be able to help you identify the cab driver to the police or the cab company.
Unless you plan to stay downtown, Miami Beach/South Beach, or in a single location elsewhere, you will find that a car is very convenient in Miami, and car rentals are cheap in comparison to other major US cities.
You can find cheap car rentals off terminal from the Miami Airport from such companies as E-Z Rent-A-Car <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.e-zrentacar.com/Locations/Miami-Airport/">[21]</a> and Ace Rent A Car. The major car rental companies can be found in terminal be can be often more expensive for the same service and vehicles.
Surface roads in Miami are usually easy to navigate. The area's roads are designed around a grid system, where most roads are numbered based on their distance from the city center. The two main axis roads are Miami Avenue (running north to south) and Flagler Street (running east to west). These two roads intersect in downtown Miami, the county's symbolic center. All avenues run north to south, while all streets run east to west.  For example, the address, "9500 NW 30th Street" would be at the intersection of NW 30th Street (to the west of Miami Avenue, and 30 blocks north of Flagler Street) and NW 95th Avenue (north of Flagler Street, and 95 blocks west of Miami Avenue). Most roads in Miami conform to this nomenclature, but due to the more than 30 municipalities within Miami-Dade County, there are a few exceptions to be aware of. Examples include Coral Gables, the Coconut Grove section of Miami (city proper), Miami Lakes, and Hialeah.  Hialeah is particularly notorious since it uses its own grid system, in addition to the overall county system. For example, NW 103rd Street is also marked as E 49th Street, or W 49th Street in Hialeah.
Note that if you cross into Broward County, the roads will be numbered based on their distance from the Fort Lauderdale city center, which is generally the same going east-west but will be very different going north-south. Most of the municipalities in Broward County use their own limited grid systems as well.  Some street names also change at the county line. The coastline highway, A1A, is known as "Collins Avenue" in Miami Beach, but becomes "Ocean Drive" in Broward County. Likewise, "Red Road" in Miami becomes "Flamingo Road" in Broward.
Miami has four primary expressways. In addition to I-95 and Floridaâs Turnpike, there is state highway <b>836</b> (also known as the <b>Dolphin Expressway</b>) and state highway <b>826</b> (also known as the <b>Palmetto Expressway</b>). The Dolphin Expressway runs west from downtown Miami along the edge of Miami International Airport. The Palmetto Expressway and Florida's Turnpike form "F"-shaped loops around the city. The Turnpike continues north, roughly parallel to I-95, and will take you to Orlando if you keep driving. I-95, the Palmetto and the Turnpike intersect at a junction in North Miami called the <b>Golden Glades</b>. You may find driving in the Glades challenging, especially if you have little experience driving in it.
New visitors to Miami should be aware that the area's drivers are particularly aggressive. AutoVantage.com's Road Rage Survey has rated Miami drivers the rudest in the country for a third year in a row <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.autovantage.com/global/scripts/promo.asp?ref=avAUTVANonlgs01">[22]</a>. This shouldn't discourage anyone from using the roadways, but a passive approach to Miami driving can save you from an unwanted exchange with another driver, or even worse an accident. Posted speed limits are ignored by most drivers, especially on larger roads with lower speed limits. Two examples are I-95 and state road 826 (The Palmetto Expressway). The eastern portion of state road 836 (The Dolphin Expressway) between Miami International Airport and downtown Miami handles traffic that exceeds its capacity, and contains several left-hand exits, including the eastbound off-ramp to Lejuene Road (NW 42nd Avenue), which is the posted route, and the quickest route to Miami International Airport.

There is a shuttle that will take you where ever you need to go from MIA airport and is called Super Shuttle Miami. Approach any of the blue vans located on the outer island. They also have guest services representatives in the airport wearing a blue Super Shuttle shirt.

Of course, if you're in Miami, you'll want to spend some time on the beach. <b>Miami Beach</b> is on a barrier reef across Biscayne Bay, and its sandy, sunny beaches from party-hearty <b>South Beach</b> continues all the way north along the coast of Florida.  As Miami has pretty temperate weather, the beaches will be active all year round. Topless sunbathing is tolerated, if not strictly legal, in Miami Beach and South Beach. If you want to take it all off, go to <b>Haulover Beach Park</b> in North Beach.

From downtown Miami you have to cross one of the two Miami bridges that are located near Miamiâs port. Once you cross the bridge you will now be on South Beach. Find Collins Ave. which will be near Ocean Ave. (South Beach's most famous street,) and look for 4441. The Fontainebleau will be on your right.
There are very few city-wide events planned during Jul and Aug  because of the high temperatures during the summer in Miami.

If you are not from the U.S., you will need a <b>work visa.</b> If you try to work while holding a <i>tourist</i> visa, you are still considered an illegal immigrant in the U.S. Immigration and Nationalization Services conduct frequent illegal immigrant checks in Miami businesses since Miami has several refugees from Cuba, Haiti and other nearby countries. If you donât have the right visa, you may not get a job in Miami.
There is an exception to getting work without a visa in Miami, however.  Since yachts and cruise ships sail on international waters, these companies can freely hire any person they like.  Non-US citizens will still require a valid seaman's visa, however, to land in US ports.

Remember that sales tax is 7% in Miami.
Most clothing shops located <i>away</i> from major Miami area shopping centers are located in South Beach.
The major supermarket chains in Miami are Publix, Walmart, Winn Dixie, and Sedanos. In addition many specialty and organic supermarkets such as Whole Foods Market and Fresh Market can also be found in Miami.
Foodies and chefs alike herald Miami for its unique New World cuisine. Created in the 1990's, the cuisine alternatively known as New World, Nuevo Latino or Florribean cuisine blends local produce, Latin American and Caribbean culinary tradition and the technical skills required in European cooking. Nuevo Latino is said to be the brainchild of four chefs: Allen Susser, Norman Van Aken, Mark Militello and Douglas Rodriguez. All of them still work in Miami and most of them work at the restaurants they created in the 1990's. New World is not restricted to these chefsâ menus. This cuisine influences several restaurants around the city to this day.
Miami may be known for its Latin cuisine, especially its Cuban cuisine but also cuisines from South American countries such as Colombia, but there are other different kinds of restaurants to be found around the city. In addition to stand-alone restaurants offering up various cuisines from Chinese and Japanese and Middle Eastern and Italian (among other cuisines), there are cafÃ©s, steakhouses and restaurants operating from boutique hotels as well as chain restaurants such as TGI Fridays and Ben &amp; Jerryâs.
Miami is known for having nightclubs double as restaurants throughout the city. Most of these restaurants, such as Tantra (which had one of their chefs recently appear on <i>Top Chef: Miami</i>), BED and the Pearl Restaurant and Champagne Lounge (attached to Nikki Beach), are located throughout South Beach. However, some of these restaurants/nightclubs like Grass Lounge can be found in the Design District (north of downtown but south of North Miami).
If many of Miamiâs premiere restaurants donât fit into your daily budget, consider eating during Miami Restaurant Month (better known as Miami Spice <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.miamirestaurantmonth.com/">[81]</a>) in August and September. This year at 80 select restaurants, lunch costs $22 and dinner is $35.
Miamiâs dining scene reflects burgeoning diversity, mixing exotic newcomer restaurants with long-standing institutions, often seasoned by Latin influence and hot winds of the Caribbean. New World cuisine, a culinary counterpart to accompany Miamiâs New World Symphony, provides a loose fusion of Latin, Asian, and Caribbean flavors utilizing fresh, area-grown ingredients. Innovative restaurateurs and chefs similarly reel in patrons with Floribbean-flavored seafood fare, while keeping true to down-home Florida favorites.
Don't be fooled by the plethora of super lean model types you're likely to see posing throughout Miami. Contrary to popular belief, dining in this city is as much a sport as the in-line skating on Ocean Drive. With over 6,000 restaurants to choose from, dining out in Miami has become a passionate pastime for locals and visitors alike. Its star chefs have fused Californian-Asian with Caribbean and Latin elements to create a world-class flavor all its own: Floribbean. Think mango chutney splashed over fresh swordfish or a spicy sushi sauce served alongside Peruvian ceviche.
Whatever you're craving, Miami's got it -- with the exception of decent Chinese food and a New York-style slice of pizza. If you're craving a scene with your steak, then South Beach is the place to be. Like many cities in Europe and Latin America, it is fashionable to dine late in South Beach, preferably after 9PM, sometimes as late as midnight. Service on South Beach is notoriously slow and arrogant, but it comes with the turf (of course, it is possible to find restaurants that defy the notoriety and actually pride themselves on friendly service). On the mainland -- especially in Coral Gables, and, more recently, downtown and on Brickell Avenue -- you can also experience fine, creative dining without the pretense.
There are several Peruvian restaurants at SW 88th Street and SW 137th Avenue in Kendale Lakes. Take the 88 or 288 buses from Dadeland North train station. This is kind of out of the way, but it is worth it.
Miami is a <a href="/en/Wikitravel:Huge_city_article_template" title="Wikitravel:Huge city article template">huge city</a>, so all individual listings should be moved to the appropriate <b><a href="#Districts">district articles</a></b>, and this section should contain a brief overview.  Please help to move listings if you are familiar with this city.

Nightlife in Miami consists of upscale hotel clubs, independent bars frequented by locals (including sports bars) and nightclubs. Most hotel bars and independent bars turn the other cheek at your physical appearance, but you have to dress to impress (which does <i>not</i> mean dress like a stripper) to get into a nightclub. Also remember to never, under any circumstances, insult the doormen and/or nightclub employees that will grant you entry or touch the velvet ropes or you may as well be sitting on the opposite side of the clamoring masses trying to get in. Attempting to tip the doormen and claiming that you know employees that work in the nightclubs (unless you actually called and reserved a table or a spot on the VIP list) is also considered an affront. Getting to the club unfashionably early and pushing through the crowd (and not the doormen) also can help make you stand out in the crowd. Finally, most nightclubs wonât admit groups of men unless those men are waiting in front of a gay bar. Bring some women or leave the pack if youâre desperate to get in. And once you get in, remember that the charge to get in these clubs can cost up to $20âcash only (some clubs, however, mercifully have ATMsâthat can charge up to $7 for a withdrawal). Popular drinks in Miami include the Cuba Libre and the mojito.
Miami is known for its boutique hotels (especially those in South Beach). Designers such as Ian Schrager (the Delano, Shore Club), AndrÃ© Balazs (Raleigh, Standard on Belle Isle) and Todd Oldham (the Hotel) helped put South Beach on the map with their creative hotel designs. The downside of many of the boutique hotels is that rooms can be small, particularly if the building was built during the height of the Art Deco period in Miami. If you value space, a boutique hotel may not be the type of hotel for you. If you don't need to stay in a boutique hotel (and value space), Miami has several upscale high-rise hotels north and south of South Beach, as well as near the downtown area. Miami does have its share of less costly chain hotels for those who value space and/or money.
The high season for hotels is around Nov to Apr because of the lower temperatures. However, Miami's lower temperatures, in comparison to the majority of the United States around this time, are still warm. High season is also marked by the advent of many Miami events, such as the Winter Music Conference and Spring Break. If you wish to reserve a room during Miamiâs high season, especially at a boutique hotel and/or a hotel on South Beach, you should book months in advance.
Be aware that hotels have a 12.5% room tax and some hotels may add a 15% service charge which may or may not be added if you reserve a room through the hotel, through a travel agent/agency (either in person or using an online site such as or similar to Expedia, Orbitz and Travelocity) or through an opaque (prices are given, but the name and location of the hotel is unknown) travel site such as Priceline or Hotwire.
Some hotels offer garage and/or valet parking; check with your hotel about parking before booking a room if you wish to drive around Miami.
The major area codes for Miami-Dade County are 305 and 786.  The 305 area code also applies to the Florida Keys (Monroe County).
In addition to some of the places listed in Eat and Miami International Airport, several hotels have internet accessâboth LAN connections and wirelessâbut it is not free in all hotels. Check with your hotel to see if internet access is free or for a fee.
Several cafes have wireless internet connections, but depending on the cafÃ© internet access may incur a fee. Unless itâs a nation-wide chain offering free internet access like Starbucks, check with your cafÃ© to inquire about whether your internet access is charged separately from your meal.
Free wireless is now offered all around Miami Beach and few neighborhoods around the Miami area. Although you might have some trouble connecting, it will still be a good way to connect with others.
Miami, frequently heralded in the news as a center of crime and drug smuggling, is only relatively dangerous for the passing tourist in certain areas. <a href="/en/Overtown" title="Overtown" class="mw-redirect">Overtown</a> (next to Liberty City) has the highest violent crime rate in the city and is best if avoided all together. If you are in this neighborhood, or any other high crime neighborhood, take the same precautions as you would in other high crime neighborhoods around the country. Such as minding one's business, getting to your destination quickly, and avoid wearing flashy jewelry and electronics. Remember that most common sense rules such as being aware of your surroundings at night and traveling in high-traffic areas at night apply in Miami as it does in all other urban areas around the United States.
The emergency telephone number for fire, police and rescue emergencies is <b>911</b>.  If you require non-emergency assistance, <i>do not</i> call 911.  To contact police in a non-emergency situation, call <i>+1 305</i> 4POLICE.
There are a lot of consulates in the Miami area. This is only a small listing of them. Check the United States Department of State's Foreign Consular Offices website <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.state.gov/s/cpr/rls/fco/">[91]</a> for more consulates.
