<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.cancun.info"><b>CancÃºn</b></a> is a coastal city in the tourist destination called The Mexican Caribbean, i.e., the state of <a href="/en/Quintana_Roo" title="Quintana Roo">Quintana Roo</a>, on <a href="/en/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>'s <a href="/en/Yucatan_Peninsula" title="Yucatan Peninsula" class="mw-redirect">Yucatan Peninsula</a>. It is a popular vacation spot on the Caribbean coast. There are two possibles meanings of Cancun, according to the Mayan language, the first translation is "nest of snakes or pot." The second version and less accepted is "place of the gold snake".
Peak season in Cancun tends to run from December to April. Prices in both airfare and hotel increase dramatically during these times, while dropping in the summer and early autumn months. Late June is especially hot, so come prepared or try the off season. Hurricanes can be a major threat in late summer and autumn.
The climate in Cancun is tropical, with consistent hot and humid weather throughout the year, and very warm sea temperatures.

Resting  on the northeast corner of the Mexican Caribbean, Cancun itself was built on a site selected as the ideal spot for a new tourist development by the Mexican government. The state of <a href="/en/Quintana_Roo" title="Quintana Roo">Quintana Roo</a> was still a territory and this area had few habitants when Cancun was built.  It is composed of fourteen miles of pristine white beaches shaped like a number "7", home of the Mayan archaeological wonders, turquoise seas, a bountiful underwater world, and world-class vacation amenities. It is still considered the gateway to the Mayan World ("El Mundo Maya"). Mayan temples and ritual sites are everywhere, some smothered by lush jungle, others easily accessible. Good tourist attractions.
The Cancun hotel zone is almost entirely built around the tourist industry. It abounds with all-inclusive resort hotels. Stay here only if you don't mind spending your vacation with many other tourists.
Downtown Cancun, especially once you get away from the ADO bus station and nearby hostels and hotels, is a real Mexican city. There are many restaurants (La Parrilla, Los Pericos, Los Arcos, El Timon de Cancun, Va que Va; all of them are really good restaurants, and the best much cheaper than Hotel Zone, and Mexican cousin), shopping centers (Plaza Las Americas, Plaza la Isla in Hotel Zone, Plaza Outlet), markets (Mercado 28 y 23) and clubs in the downtown area that you can visit during your stay (Cocobongo, Dady'O, Palazzo, Mandala).
Those mostly seeking beaches and scuba diving, or who are a bit adventurous, can easily find rooms on equally beautiful and less crowded beaches along the coast just an hour or two south of Cancun. Some Spanish language skills may aid in finding better deals. You can rent a car, or take the bus to <a href="/en/Puerto_Morelos" title="Puerto Morelos">Puerto Morelos</a> (about 20&#160;min) or <a href="/en/Tulum" title="Tulum">Tulum</a> (1&#160;hr). <a href="/en/Playa_del_Carmen" title="Playa del Carmen">Playa del Carmen</a> (45&#160;min, $80) is between the two, but caters to the all-inclusive crowd. Taxis are also available.
Those looking for a base of operations who want good or luxury hotels and the advantages of urban life but prefer more local flavor may wish to stay in the Yucatan's main city of <a href="/en/M%C3%A9rida_(Yucatan)" title="MÃ©rida (Yucatan)" class="mw-redirect">MÃ©rida</a>. Many international flights in to Cancun continue on after a stop to MÃ©rida's International Airport.
<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.asur.com.mx/asur/ingles/aeropuertos/cancun/cancun.asp"><b>CancÃºn International Airport</b></a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IATA" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:IATA">IATA</a>: <b>CUN</b>) (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICAO" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:ICAO">ICAO</a>: <b>MMUN</b>) is Mexico's second busiest airport and is about 10&#160;km (6&#160;mi) from the hotel strip and 16&#160;km (9&#160;mi) southwest of downtown.
One of Cancun's best features is its transport links, as most major air carriers in North, Central, and South America, have service to Cancun. There are some extremely cheap charter flight deals available from the <a href="/en/UK" title="UK" class="mw-redirect">UK</a> (from around UKÂ£100) as well as commercial flight deals from several European carriers. International flights within Latin America are usually expensive such as those coming from Central and South America.
Airlines that fly to Cancun from:
With exception of Jetblue and AirTran (Terminal 2), the rest of the USA flights are at Terminal 3 ('C' gates).  Some of the European &amp; charter carriers are also at Terminal 3 while most are at Terminal 2.  The rest of the other international flights are at Terminal 2, check with your airline.  Keep in mind that airlines that normally uses Terminal 3 can be redirected to disembark at Terminal 2 and vice-versa so check with them regarding check-in location upon departure .   At Terminal 2 the international flights are at concourse 'A' (Octagonal structure on the west end of the building) while the national/domestic flights are at concourse 'B' (Main building behind the check-in hall.  National arrivals are at the east end of the building).  Terminal 1 is used for charters, general aviation, VIP flights and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.mayair.com.mx/">Mayair</a> flights (to Cozumel, Merida, Veracruz and Villahermosa).  Charter flights can also be at either Terminal 2 or 3 so check with them as to where to check in at for the departure flight (home).
Be sure to pass the customs before looking for money exchange - for example inside customs zone in Cancun they offer MX$10.50 to US$1, which is much lower than even greediest street vendors ask. (City bank, Elektra are the best money exchanges you can try.)
The hardest part of the journey to Cancun (aside from your initial airport check-in) is getting from the luggage carousel to your transportation. Make sure you know who your transport is (in case of prebooking) and find them on the outside, as that is where they will be. Unless you are looking for a timeshare, free meal or looking to burn hours of travel time and money on your vacation, do NOT stop to chit-chat with anyone about booking tours and such. There is plenty of time for that after you get settled in. After you clear customs inspection (the red or green light baggage inspection), do not give your bags to any locals offering to carry them.
There are many companies that provide the transfer service to the hotels in Cancun or the Riviera Maya. All of them have the option of prebooking online; some of them can be booked when arriving but this may represent another waiting time. Some of the well-known companies offering shared and private transfers are:
There are other transportation firms that provide service to and from the airport for a reasonable price as well. Beware of touts who will surround you when you come out of customs clearance. If you proceed straight, you will find the official information center where they can help you with the ground transportation options. If you bought an online shuttle service reservation and you don't find your driver, call customer service yourself; do not trust local people who claim to be airport employees trying to "help" you (usually airport employees wait for you to come to them, and not the other way round).  The legitimate drivers (and their reps) for these shuttle companies are outside the building, outside the exit glass doors, towards their vehicles.
<b><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.ado.com.mx">ADO</a></b> is the main long distance inter-city bus carrier in the Yucatan Peninsula and <i>Riviera</i> is their subsidiary brand, offering the cheapest transfer option from the airport. They offer regular bus service from both terminals at the airport to the downtown bus station and down to Playa del Carmen.  The "airport bus station" is in the parking lot outside the domestic arrivals doors at Terminal 2.  For international arrivals you turn right, after coming out of the building and walk across to the other side of the building. At Terminal 3 it's a right turn from outside the arrivals doors and past 'Air Margaritaville' (formerly 'Coconuts Welcome Bar') hut.  Tickets can be purchased from the representative at the podium with the 'ADO' sign in front of the (first) stall where the bus pulls in at.
<b><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.autotur.com.mx/">AutoTur</a></b> is a rented bus line for chartered tour groups and you'll see them at the airport waiting to pick up a tour group and take them to their hotel or wherever they're scheduled to go to. If you're here with a tour group look for the tour company representative (or guide) holding up the sign for the tour company you're traveling with to direct you to the right bus (as there are several them at the airport 'bus station').
Beware of leaving Mexico with enough money. The Mexican Government charges a travel tax of around $500 (US$45) to leave the country from the airport. Most major air carriers may already have the travel tax charged to the price of the ticket, though it is highly recommended that travelers check this before leaving to/from Cancun. For example, Thomas Cook is charging $660, and U.S. dollars are not accepted. -- The current collective travel experience (from TripAdvisor) shows that almost all airlines flying from the US have already included this tax in their airfare, so there is no need to pay again when leaving Cancun. It seems that only charter flights from the UK do not include this tax and UK travelers may need to pay upon leaving.
Also beware of going through security too early. Food and drink prices almost double and you can't easily go back.
The main bus station is at Calle Pino, SM23, MZ56, Lt 1 y 2 which is at the 10 o'clock position (northwest, north is at the 12 o'clock position) of the roundabout at Av Tulum &amp; Av Uxmal in downtown (el centro). The following bus companies operate buses to/from here (Note:  The 800 toll free numbers are for calling from within Mexico unless stated otherwise.  Other numbers are regular or local numbers.  From outside Mexico you will have to call the regular numbers):
Cancun is very easy to navigate. To the South is the airport, to the North is the city and in between on the stretch of land between the sea and the Nichupte lagoon are all the hotels, beaches and bars, referred to as the hotel zone or <i>Zona Hotelera</i>. Downtown is where most residents live and it stretches in on the mainland behind the lagoon.
It can be interesting catching a bus - they stop when you don't want them! It is better to pay in pesos, no dollars.
Bus is the preferred way of getting around. Buses are cheap and come frequently. Most bus drivers are very courteous and will stop for you even if you are not waiting at a bus stop. After paying the fare, which is on a per person basis, the driver will hand you a ticket/receipt which are usually printed with advertisements. Just so there are no surprises, do not expect buses to have amenities such as air conditioning and seat cushions. Also, most bus drivers speak enough English just to help visitors get around.
Buses head up and down the main thoroughfare, Blvd Kukulcan, named after the feather serpent which is the main Mayan deity, from the Mayan words <i>kukul</i> (bird) and <i>can</i> (snake). Buses pass constantly but be prepared for a cramped and rough ride. The rules for the bus drivers seem to be "he who gets to the next passenger quickest, makes the most money". Therefore, be prepared for a wild, but entertaining ride. Frequently, locals will get on with their instruments and "entertain". Some are quite good.
When you are ready to get off, you can either push the button on top of the hand rail, or if you're not sure of your destination, tell the driver where you would like to get off or point to the destination using a bus map. Most bus drivers speak enough English to understand non-Spanish speakers.
Be careful when the bus is full as pick-pocketing is a concern.
Companies serving the station include all attractions and towns along the coast: the <b>Riviera Express</b> for the Riviera Maya (Playa del Carmen, Tulum, Xel-Ha, etc.) and <b>ADO</b> for the major national destinations. For some Riviera Maya destinations, it's possible to stop the buses on the Tulum Avenue without having to go all the way to the station, however if you are unsure about where to catch the bus then it's best to go to the station.
Taxis are plentiful, a bit expensive for the hotel zone and airport, but cheap in the downtown area. Fares for the hotel zone depend on how far along the Blvd Kukulcan you want to go (fares available at hotel receptions and shopping centres), while within the downtown there is a general fixed fare of about $20 per trip, it is best to just ask the driver upon boarding to avoid misunderstandings. By far, the best mode of transportation for the hotel zone is by bus. The bus fare is cheap and getting from Point A to Point B doesn't take very long.
Be careful and clear with your taxista. They have set rates on paper for how much they should charge for the trip per kilometer (no meter). You can also obtain a discount about 10% if you ask. If you are splitting a cab with friends, be clear on the number of services, people, and price he will charge to your destination. If your friends get out before you he can charge you twice the amount you negotiated for just a few more kilometers. A "service" is considered to be from start point to a requested stop point. If your taxista is non-cooperative there are about 10 more taxis around every corner.
Be very careful if you choose to drive in Cancun. The police seem to pull tourists over at the drop of a hat during spring break. When you pick up a rental, check that all the lights work. Also when you are pulled over for a light violation, do not be surprised if the police holds out an open palmed hand, while holding your driverâs license hostage in the other. Most police officers are underpaid and will for the most part demand a small bribe to let you off the hook.

There are several activities you can do in Cancun and the rest of the Riviera Maya. You can either buy them from the provider or through an agency. Most of the agencies offer extra value at the same price. Here are some online travel agencies located in Cancun where you can find tours, things to do and excursion:
Here is a list of the most popular activities in Cancun:
Cancun and the sorrounding area offers amazing possibilities to get out of the touristy areas and get close to nature. You find caves, underwater rivers, pristine jungle, botanical garden, national parks all close to the city. You also have world class diving, but if you are not certified you can also snorkel on the second largest barrier reef in the world, or with Whale Sharks, Manta Rays, Sea Turtles or with huge groups of Sailfish. The Yucatan peninsula is packed with natural wonders, you just need to know where to look.
Many companies are offering one day trips but you need to be aware, the easiest a tour looks, the less nature oriented it is. In many cases the best option is to rent a car and visit the parks and places on your own (or with a local guide). Some activites, like the Whale Sharks or Sailfish can be organized only through a licenced operator. Look for the specialized Eco-Tour operators there are a few but still not too many in Cancun.
With golf courses in Cancun, visitors can still have a great vacation and enjoy the game. Surrounded by the beautiful Mexican landscape these courses are home of renowned championships.
When shopping in Cancun, you can either go into downtown or the hotel zone. Downtown is much cheaper.
Cancun is one of the premier spa destinations in the world with a choice of more than thirty Cancun Spa Resorts that promise to transport your mind, body and spirit to a nirvana of pure bliss. Spas in Cancun offer treatments combining native, ancient mayan healing rituals, modern stress-reducing techniques.
Try a traditional Temazcal steam bath or a full-body massage on the beach overlooking the turquoise blue waters. Indulge in a thalassotherapy treatment and relax as expert therapists provide natural body wraps made with local plants and flowers
.
Cancun's nightlife is unlike any other destination on Earth. For some, a day in Cancun doesn't start until tasks like an 11AM breakfast, nap on the beach, and siesta are arduously completed. This is your place to shine.
The <b>legal drinking age</b> in Mexico is 18, but it is not strongly enforced.
The Hotel Zone is a huge venue and gets top entertainers and DJs. Don't be surprised to see Vegas like shows spontaneously erupt while you are sipping your piÃ±a colada. These clubs can charge large covers ranging from US$20-60 per person, though the cover can include an open bar.
You may find yourself dancing in a conga line, laughing your cares away and speaking whatever <i>EspaÃ±ol</i> you managed to pickup. A must for the first timers, and always good fun for returners also. Coco Bongo's entertainment includes a show, complete with girls swinging from the ceilings.
Also try the clubs at <b>Yaxchilan Avenue</b>, located in downtown Cancun, where all the locals hang out.
Cancun is in the state of Quintana Roo, at the north-eastern tip of the Yucatan peninsula. During the â70s it became an exclusive tourist destination, after the construction of the first hotels. Cancun is divided into two very distinct areas: the hotel area, an island separated from the mainland, connected by two bridges in the North and the South. In the interior is the lagoon called NichuptÃ©. The second area is the centre of the modern city of Cancun, full of shops, restaurants and shows.
CancÃºn has a large range of 3-5 star hotels in the "hotel zone" and some more economical hotels in the city center.
Note that several aging resorts located on and around Punta Cancun are now relying upon heavily discounted vacation packages or all-inclusive deals to fill rooms.  They market themselves heavily as a great bargain to starving college students as well as working-class and lower middle class tourists, many of whom are going overseas for their first time.  The result is that Punta Cancun is jam-packed with people who can barely afford to be on vacation and perpetuate all the "ugly American" bad tourist stereotypes.  If you prefer to spend your vacations around people who can handle their liquor and are sensible enough to only yell in real emergencies, it may be worth it to splurge on a newer resort in the central or southern part of the Hotel Zone.  Then you can save Punta for a brief day trip, mainly to reassure yourself why you are paying $100 more per day for a much quieter (and more pleasant) experience.
Riu Palace Peninsula- New 5 star all inclusive resort with 572 ocean view suites and 5 large swimming pools, Including one with swim up bar. Also 5 restaurants in resort.
You could also try out the growing vacation rental market as well. It's a chance to experience Cancun without having to share close spaces with thousands of tourists. They are an alternative if you are willing to go without the frills of room service or resort commodities.
Most resorts in the hotel zone have a travel agent on site during the daytime to assist you with making reservations around Cancun, including the Mayan ruins. It is often better to book activities through these travel agents as they are employed by the hotel and cannot easily cheat you. Activities are also sold at booths found in the busier areas. Prices for the same activities are cheaper in Cancun town than in the hotel zone.
It is highly recommended that you buy bottled water and drink it frequently to avoid dehydration or heat stroke.  Bottled water, depending on size, typically costs $30-50 (US$2.75-4.55).
Otherwise, <b>do not drink the water</b> unless your hotel has a water purification system. Most of the resorts in Cancun have purified water at all of the facilities located inside the resorts including the bars and restaurants. The upper-scale restaurants usually have purified water as well, but the water outside of these areas is not safe to drink.
The sun's UV rays are extremely strong in Cancun, even on cloudy days, and will burn any exposed skin on most persons from northern climates within a few minutes.  Sunscreens that may be adequate elsewhere may not be sufficient in Cancun.
Because Cancun has powerful waves (see below), do not assume your sunscreen layer will remain intact.  <i>Always</i> apply a fresh layer of sunscreen after taking a dip in the ocean.
<b>Timeshares</b><br />
Expect to be inundated with offers to get free tickets, tours, or other items in exchange for viewing a timeshare presentation while in Cancun.  While you will generally be given what is promised for viewing the presentation, expect a very high pressure sales pitch lasting from one to two hours during which you may be given incorrect information or promises that later turn out to be untrue.  In particular, despite claims of agencies that can buyback your timeshare, most timeshares are a money-losing proposition for purchasers.  As with any major purchase, take the time to research before buying - claims that you must buy something <b>right now</b> should always be treated with skepticism.  See also <a href="/en/Common_scams" title="Common scams">Common scams</a>.
<b>Ocean Currents</b>&#8212; The ocean currents in Cancun, depending on the season you visit, can be strong. While the currents may not be strong enough to pull you under, keep your guard up at all times. Look for the coloured flags that are planted on the beach as well as ask your hotel's concierge or a lifeguard (if one is available). As a rule of thumb, if you're not a strong swimmer (or a non-swimmer) it is best to stick to the hotel's pool for water fun. Remember, beaches in Mexico are Federal Zones with no life guards on duty, lifeguards may only be found within the beaches at the hotels.
<b>Weather</b>&#8212; Cancun is a place where the weather can change in a matter of minutes rather than hours. As in most tropical places, rain storms will start quickly and leave as quickly as it came. When a storm lingers, use caution in the water; especially when lightning is present.
<b>Timeshare and condos are a big business all over Yucatan, especially Cancun.</b> "Tourist information" is another word for sales representative. If someone is offering you an "free" tour to anyplace or at a discount this means a 90 minute or longer presentation about condos and time-shares. There are 20 reps waiting on the righthand side when you arrive at the Cancun airport. There are also reps in Mexico city attracting tourists with free Xe-Hal and Chichen Ha tours.  These timeshare presentations are not always a waste of time. Some of these timeshare presentations offer coupons or other free offers which can total to several thousand dollars of savings during your trip if you are willing to endure the presentation.
<b>Nothing is free</b>- Most important lesson. Someone comes up to you and says you want a shot of tequlia? Come on its fun. This means you have not negotiated the price.
<b>Don't use ATMs out of the banks</b>- There are ATMs all over Cancun. Use only ones that are inside banks or your hotel. Pharmacies, stores, gas stations are to be avoided. You will become a victim of identity theft (There is security 24 hrs a day in hotel zone, but you never know, just common sense)or you will find big charges for the commission of using them.
<b>The Buddy System</b>- If you plan to have a long night out in the strip, take precautions and have a friend with you at all times (even walking to the bathroom). Unsuspecting tipsy tourists can be easy targets for petty robbery.
