<b>Edirne</b> (pronounced <i>eh-deer-neh</i>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.edirnekulturturizm.gov.tr/">[1]</a>) is a city in <a href="/en/Eastern_Thrace" title="Eastern Thrace">Eastern Thrace</a>, in northwest <a href="/en/Turkey" title="Turkey">Turkey</a>. It lies on the gently rolling Thracian plains (much of the city is fairly flat, though) and just east of confluence of Maritsa, Tundzha, and Arda Rivers, known in Turkish as <i>MeriÃ§</i>, <i>Tunca</i>, and <i>Arda</i>, respectively.
This city can be your first or last destination in Turkey, depending on the direction of your itinerary, since itâs located at the junction of the borders of three countries: <a href="/en/Turkey" title="Turkey">Turkey</a>, <a href="/en/Greece" title="Greece">Greece</a>, and <a href="/en/Bulgaria" title="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a>. Visiting this city is also feasible as a long day trip from <a href="/en/Istanbul" title="Istanbul">Istanbul</a>.
With the completion of the motorway from KapÄ±kule, the main border post for road travel from <a href="/en/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a> into Turkey, Edirne lost much of its trade evolving around travelers heading east and members of the Turkish diaspora in Europe heading home for their annual visits. Today most of tourism in the city involves day trippers, Turkish and foreign, from <a href="/en/Istanbul" title="Istanbul">Istanbul</a> and the <a href="/en/Balkans" title="Balkans">Balkan</a> countries looking for cheap goods in the market.
The imperial past is what makes Edirne interesting, from huge Ottoman imperial complexes to neo-classical architecture of downtown shops, although at first all youâll see will be concrete apartment blocks when entering the city (and Selimiye Mosque right in front of you).
The area around Edirne, thanks to its strategic position on the major routes to <a href="/en/Istanbul" title="Istanbul">Istanbul</a>, Bosphorus, and onward to <a href="/en/Asia" title="Asia">Asia</a>, had been repeatedly fought for in the past.  It has been the site of no fewer than 16 major battles and sieges since the days of Ancient Greece.
Edirneâs former name is <b>Adrianople</b> (<i>Hadrianoupolis</i>), i.e. âCity of Hadrthe ianusâ, named after the Roman emperor who founded the city on the site of Thracian village of Uskudama.
In the 14th century, the Ottomans captured the city and made it their capital, this lasted until the Fall of Constantinople. Even after the dynasty moved to <a href="/en/Istanbul" title="Istanbul">Constantinople</a> in the mid 15th century, Edirne was one of, if not the most, important centers of the European part of the Ottoman Empire. Edirne functioned as a semi-capital of the empire, with some sultans even favoring the city over Istanbul and whispering about returning the throne back to the city. Between 1700 and 1750, Edirne was the fourth most populated city in Europe, with an estimated population of about 350,000.
Dramatic changes started in the early 19th century and the city suffered heavy depopulation due to the Russo-Turkish wars of 1829.  Another war with Russia in 1878, when Russians occupied lands extending to the western suburbs of Istanbul, along with the Balkan Wars of late 19th/early 20th century caused further depopulation.  Lands which were part of the city during the Ottoman Era, along with Western and Northern suburbs were lost to the redrawing of borders in the 1910s and 20s.  During WWII when Nazi armies were only miles away from the city, on the opposite banks of the rivers, the population was moved to interior Turkey. Some of those who could not flee died of starvation during this period. This depopulation slowly but constantly continued until recently, with a recent census showing only 140,000 people. Although it is quite a lively city when compared to other Turkish cities of this size, only a fraction of its former glory remains.
The major streets of the city all fan out of main square, which is surrounded by three imperial mosques of Selimiye, ÃÃ§ Åerefeli and Old Mosques &#8212; <i>Talat PaÅa BulvarÄ±</i> lies towards east, eventually turning into the highway to <a href="/en/Istanbul" title="Istanbul">Istanbul</a>, while <i>Londra AsfaltÄ±</i> leads to <a href="/en/Bulgaria" title="Bulgaria">Bulgarian</a> border at KapÄ±kule in the west, via Gazi Mihal Bridge across Tundzha. To north, <i>HÃ¼kÃ¼met Caddesi</i> connects city centre with the former palace neighbourhood in SarayiÃ§i and to south pedestrianized <i>SaraÃ§lar Caddesi</i> lies, extension lying on the edge of old city and open to vehicular traffic of which eventually leads to KaraaÄaÃ§ across Tundzha and Maritsa.
Temperate continental &#8212; hot and occasionally rainy (as showers which tend to last for 15&#8211;20 minutes) summers (expect up to 40Âº C); cold and rainy, occasionally snowy winters (expect down to -10Âº C). Spring and autumn months tend to be warmer than the locations on the sea coast (such as <a href="/en/Istanbul" title="Istanbul">Istanbul</a>)&#8212;so if day-tripping from a coastal place during those months, especially in May, drink plenty of water to avoid headaches due to dehydration&#8212;but winter arrives earlier (in November). Because Edirne lies in a geography that is the entering point of many weather systems from Balkans (Southeastern Europe) into Turkey, a good way of forecasting the weather conditions for the next few days is to follow what other Balkan cities such as <a href="/en/Plovdiv" title="Plovdiv">Plovdiv</a>, <a href="/en/Bulgaria" title="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a> is currently experiencing, as quite the same conditions will be what Edirne is experiencing within a two or three days time.
Due to cold and dry winds of winters, packing along some kind of skin moisturizer in addition to warm clothing is essential to avoid badly dried skin (which can go as far as bleeding in coldest days).
Of the nearby airports, the most convenient is <b>AtatÃ¼rk International</b> in <a href="/en/Istanbul" title="Istanbul">Istanbul</a>, which has flights from all inhabited continents and a metro line providing an easy connection to main bus station (<i>otogar</i>).
The easiest way to reach Edirne is by bus from <a href="/en/Istanbul" title="Istanbul">Istanbul</a>. Departures are at various times with a fare of 27 Turkish Lira and a duration of 2h 40m, although stiff competition between the bus companies may sometimes result in fares as low as 10 TL (â¬5) pp. The bus station in Edirne is located way out of the city but free service midibuses will take you to the city center (final stop is near selimiye mosque where city offices of the bus companies are located). Busses and dolmus also driving to the otogar for 2 Liras (line 1).
Please take into account that a trip from taksim by bus will take about an hour.
There are no direct buses to <a href="/en/Bulgaria" title="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a>. It is, however, possible to take a taxi to Kapikule on the Bulgarian border. From there one can sometimes wave over a bus traveling on to <a href="/en/Plovdiv" title="Plovdiv">Plovdiv</a> and <a href="/en/Sofia" title="Sofia">Sofia</a>. Another approach could be to walk across the border and take a bus or train from Kapitan Andreevo on the Bulgarian side of the border.
Note: metro bus company offers tickets from edirne to bulgaria on the line istanbul-sofia with stops in haskovo and plovdiv from edirne, but the bus not going from the otogar, it stops at arslanli tesisleri (hotel and gas station in the middle of nowhere, not far from the border). Taxi costs around 20 Lira from the center and 50 lira from the otogar.
There are two daily trains from <a href="/en/Istanbul" title="Istanbul">Istanbul</a>âs Sirkeci station (one at 8:30AM in the morning, and the other at 3:50PM in the afternoon. Both arrives in Edirne about four hours later). Trains from <a href="/en/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a> to Istanbul also call at the station.
The main station (signed as <i>Edirne Gar</i> on the station building) lies about 4 km east of downtown, close to the main avenue heading eastern suburbs of the city (which is also the main highway to Istanbul). However, all trains to Edirne drive onward west to KapÄ±kule (main borderpost on Bulgarian border) and call at <i>Edirne Åehir</i> station on the way, too, which is little more than a platform next to the rail tracks, lying less than a kilometre away from downtown to southwest, on the edge of the old quarter (<i>KaleiÃ§i</i>) and close to the banks of Tundzha.
The city is on the main highways linking Turkey and Europe (road numbers: toll-free D100 and toll-road/motorway O-3/E80). A drive takes no more than two hours from <a href="/en/Istanbul" title="Istanbul">Istanbul</a> (224 km away) to Edirne on the motorway, even less if you drive <i>very</i> fast. The main European-Turkish border post Kapikule/Kapitan Andreevo (between Turkey and <a href="/en/Bulgaria" title="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a>, SE of <a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Svilengrad&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Svilengrad (page does not exist)">Svilengrad</a>) is about 15-20 km away from the city, while less significant Pazarkule border post (between Turkey and <a href="/en/Greece" title="Greece">Greece</a>, north of <a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Orestiada&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Orestiada (page does not exist)">Orestiada</a>) is even nearer.
While it's theoretically possible for even large ships to enter the Maritsa River from the Aegean Sea and navigate upriver up to Edirne (which was indeed common during the time of Romans), the intense border area through which the river flows makes any use of any kind of water transportation impractical.
Almost entirety of Edirne is in walking distance, which is made even easier by the mostly flat topography of the city. However for some relatively distant places you may take taxi which will cost only a few euros.
There are also lots of minibuses heading for outer neighborhoods of the city.
The sights in Edirne can be roughly grouped into those that are in downtown, those in northwestern neighbourhoods (SarayiÃ§i, and Yeniimaret) across the Tundzha River, and those in southwestern neighbourhood (KaraaÄaÃ§) across the Tundzha and the Maritsa Rivers. A good number of medieval bridges span these rivers.
Main sights in downtown are quite close to the main square and to each other, and can be (hastily) done in half a day.
Across the Tundzha from downtown, in the northwestern outskirts of the city lie <b>SarayiÃ§i</b>, literally âinside the palaceâ and <b>Yeniimaret</b>. Both are linked to city centre by their respective medieval bridges.
Most of the monuments around this section of the city were actually located in cityâs suburbs, however the depopulation of the city resulted much of them now lying in the middle of open fields.
South of SarayiÃ§i is the neighbourhood of Yeniimaret, which, like SarayiÃ§i, is connected to the downtown by two bridges with an island on the Tundzha inbetween and is where the Medical Museum is located.
South of Yeniimaret, due west of city centre is <b>Gazi Mihal Bridge</b> (<i>Gazi Mihal KÃ¶prÃ¼sÃ¼</i>), a long arch bridge built during Byzantine period and then repaired in 1420 that spans the Tundzha and lies on the main highway to KapÄ±kule border post from city centre, and the adjacent <b>Gazi Mihal Mosque</b> (<i>Gazi Mihal Camii</i>), built by Gazi Mihal Pasha, an Ottoman commander of Bulgarian origin. These are better accessible from city centre rather than from Yeniimaret, though a stroll along the dykes along the Tundzha will bring you here too.
Southwest of downtown is the quarter of <b>KaraaÄaÃ§</b> (pronounced <i>kaa raa aa ach</i>), the only Turkish territory west of Maritsa River, which forms most of Turkish-Greek land border.
Two <b>Ottoman bridges</b> connect KaraaÄaÃ§ to downtown, which are well worth a look&#8212;pick these if you donât have time to check out any other bridge around the city. The first and shorter one, just southwest of the edge of old quarter (KaleiÃ§i) and actually quite close to the Synagogue at the end of Maarif Caddesi, spans the Tundzha. About 250 mt further, youâll arrive at the second one, which spans the Maritsa and is gloriously longer than the first one, as the riverbed is gloriously larger, not much unlike that of Danube. Right at the midpoint of the bridge, there is a lookout in typical Ottoman style.
A two-and-a-half-kilometre long cobbled road through a lush forest links the Maritsa Bridge with KaraaÄaÃ§. On the way, there is an urban forest named <b>SÃ¶ÄÃ¼tlÃ¼k</b> (admission 2 TL pp), a favourite weekend picnic spot of locals which extends along the bank of river.
KaraaÄaÃ§ has an atmosphere more of a town rather than a city neighbourhood, with some charming <b>mansions</b> scattered around its grid plan. At the southwestern end of KaraaÄaÃ§ is the historical building in late Ottoman style of the <b>Presidency of Trakya University</b> (<i>Trakya Ãniversitesi RektÃ¶rlÃ¼ÄÃ¼</i>), placed in a pleasant garden (free admission). The building, which dates back to the final years of 19th century, was originally built as the main train station of the city as the steam locomotive at the backyard still attests, and had that service for years until 1970s when it was abandoned after a new railway straight to the city was laid, due to the increasingly inconvenient operation of former railtracks crisscrossing Turkish-Greek border as the relations between two nations detoriate. The university took over in 1998. At the side of the building is <b>Lausanne Monument</b> (<i>Lozan AnÄ±tÄ±</i>), a metallic structure of three columns symbolizing Turkey (the longest one symbolizes Asian Turkey, the middle-sized symbolizes <a href="/en/Eastern_Thrace" title="Eastern Thrace">Eastern Thrace (European Turkey)</a>, while the shortest symbolizes KaraaÄaÃ§ itself, being the only Turkish soil west of Maritsa River, in other words west of <i>Eastern</i> Thrace) with a lady in the middle holding a sheet of paper, presumably symbolizing Treaty of Lausanne, in which major western powers recognized newly founded Turkish Republic in 1923. Behind the monument, in the shades of a pine woods is an <b>open air sculpture exhibition</b> (free admission) which contains marble statues chipped <i>in situ</i> by sculptors from neighbouring countries.
Edirne is famous for its <b>fruit-shaped soaps</b>. They are not used for cleaning (although they can clean as well as other soaps do) but for decoration. Within the first months you put them into a room, they also work as natural air fresheners by releasing their fragrances.
<b>Almond paste</b> (<i>badem ezmesi</i>) is a local, soft cookie-like dessert which is made of bitter almond.
<b>Brooms</b> â While it may be a bit strange to buy brooms as a souvenir from a trip, Edirne has a long tradition of broommaking and ornamental brooms (traditionally given to brides as a gift) can be found at numerous stores (especially at those offering tourist souvenirs) around the city.
Edirne has numerous <b>Ottoman covered bazaars</b>.
<b>Liver</b> (<i>ciÄer</i>) is a definitely must-try for non-vegetarians. It is prepared in a unique local way (whole pieces, not puree, of liver, covered in flour, are deep fried inside a cauldron full of boiling vegetable oil) and served with an infernally hot dried and crunchy pepper. If you are one of those who donât like liver because of its distinct smell, you can be pretty sure you wonât sense it in Edirne liver. Best to be eaten with <i>ayran</i>, a salty yogurt drink because itâs one of two things (the other is bread, which fortunately is served free of charge at liver restaurants) that can suppress the fire the dried pepper leaves on your palate.
There is a cluster of small sit-in eateries (<i>ciÄerci</i>) in the park next to the Old Mosque (<i>Eski Cami</i>), all offering basically the same menu (i.e., the fried liver), and a really filling portion of liver costs 9 TL in any of them. They also order other meals from other nearby restaurants for those who are with you and do not want to eat liver. <b>Yudum</b> at one corner of the cluster is good, clean, and efficient.
For vegetarians, <b>Melek Anne</b> has variety of house-made foods, served in a nice old traditional Turkish house, located on Maarif Street (right behind Alipasa Bazaar).
Compared with most cities of its size in Turkey, Edirne is full of <i>birahane</i>s (pubs) and restaurants that serve alcohol. There are some particuarly nice ones by the river on the road to Karaagac.
Tourism in Edirne is on the rise and hotel scene is improving with many nice hotels to stay.
<br />
Avoid hanging around the banks of Tundza and Maritsa Rivers and KaraaÄaÃ§ before/during/after a heavy rainfall, especially in wintertime. Although the downtown is never affected, these areas tend to have a <b>heavy flood</b> during such a time, mainly because of overflowing of dams located upriver in Bulgaria. So if you are in Edirne in winter and plan to visit the aforementioned locations (which you should), stay ahead of weather forecasts. If you see a water rise in the river, be suspicious, call and inform police (telephone number: 155), and quickly go to somewhere far from and higher than riverbed as much as possible. The buildings themselves in KaraaÄaÃ§ are rarely or lightly affected, but the problem is that the quarter is cut off from the rest of the world as the bridges which connect it to downtown Edirne sink underwater. If you are trapped in such a situation, be sure about your distance to the river and wait for evacuation crews. Because affected areas are generally the same in each flood, they are quick to respond with their boats and gear.
Be sure to have your passport with you if you plan to leave by bus, altough this is not a problem in the Istanbul otogar, but it will be a problem in Edirne.
Cityâs telephone code is <b>284</b> (+90 284 when calling from out of Turkey).
