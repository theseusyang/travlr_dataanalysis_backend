<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://english.comune.venezia.it"><b>Venice</b></a> (Italian: <i>Venezia</i>) is one of the most interesting and lovely places in the world.
This sanctuary on a lagoon is virtually the same as it was six hundred years ago, which adds to the fascinating character. Venice has decayed since its heyday and is heavily touristed (there are slightly more tourists than residents), but the romantic charm remains.
This place may not seem huge but it is. Venice is made of different boroughs. The most famous is the area comprising the 118 islands in the main districts that are called "Sestieri" and they are: Cannaregio, Castello, Dorsoduro, San Polo, Santa Croce and San Marco, where the main monuments and sights are located. Other main districts are Isola Della Giudecca and Lido di Venezia. Other important islands include Murano, Torcello, San Francesco del Deserto and Burano, but there are several.
The <b>Most Serene Republic of Venice</b> dates back to 827, when a Byzantine Duke moved its seat to what is now known as the Rialto, and for the following 970 years,  prospered on trade and under the rule of a Roman-style Senate headed by the <b>Doge</b>.  In 1797,  the city was conquered by Napoleon, a blow from which it never recovered.  The city was soon merged into Austria-Hungary, then ping-ponged back and forth between Austria and a nascent Italy, but Venice is still a monument to the glory days of the Renaissance, and historical culture still throbs powerfully in the old Italians' veins.
The carnival and when it's raining may be the worst time to visit: it's very rainy - you might even have to buy water proof shoes, which are sold on the streets for around â¬20. When it's raining there are mosquitoes and occasional infestations of flies. Spring and fall are probably best, a compromise between temperature (expect 5-15Â°C in March) and the tourist load. Between November and January, you may manage to feel you have Venice all to yourself, an interesting and quiet experience. Beware of the weather during the winter months: it can be quite cold, windy, and damp. Fog is an additional hazard if you are driving in or out, doubly so in the unlikely chance that you will pilot a boat. That said, if you've never been to Venice, it's better to go in summer than not to go. You won't regret it. Many cities are far worse in summer, and Venice has no cars, hence no smog.
<i><b>Acqua alta</b></i> (high water) has become a fact of life in Venice.  The lagoon water level occasionally rises above the level of the squares and streets, flooding them.  This can happen several times a year, at irregular intervals, usually in the colder months. Acqua alta usually lasts a few hours and coincides with high tide. You'll see raised walkways in side alleys ready to be pulled out when <i>acqua alta</i> hits. When the city begins to flood, sirens will sound to warn residents and businesses. If you speak fluent Italian, tune into news programs since their predictions of the times the flood begins and ends are usually on the spot. Normally, the tide rises and falls in six-hour cycles.
You can get an <i>acqua alta</i> map at the tourist offices either at the railway station or St Marks.  This will show you the higher, dry routes and the ones with walkways set up during the various flood alerts.  There is a tide measuring station at the Rialto vaporetto piers, and a noticeboard at the base of the Campanile in the Piazza San Marco that shows a live tide reading and predictions for the next few days.
Because Venice is on a lagoon, the water plays a crucial role in transportation. Whichever way you arrive, the last part of your journey will be on foot from the nearest waterbus/watertaxi jetty. If you need to carry or wheel bags along the narrow streets, bear this in mind when chosing your hotel location and route to it.
The closest commercial airport is <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://veniceairport.it">Marco Polo Airport</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICAO" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:ICAO">ICAO</a>: <b>LIPZ</b>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IATA" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:IATA">IATA</a>: <b>VCE</b>), on the mainland near <a href="/en/Mestre" title="Mestre">Mestre</a> (a more typical Italian city, without Venice's unique structure). There is a city bus and a shuttle bus from Marco Polo to Piazzale Roma. See the details in the "By bus" section below.
By Boat - Turn left on leaving the terminal and walk 10 minutes along the covered walkway to the boat jetty. Alilaguna water-bus costs &#8364;15 for a 75 minute boat trip. Murano costs &#8364;8 and takes only half an hour. There are three Alilaguna routes to different areas of Venice. A direct waterbus from the airport may be be more convenient than taking the bus to the bus station and then changing to the local waterbus. Note that the waterbus services that run to the airport are operated by a different company (Alilaguna) than the other public waterbus services in Venice, so separate tickets will be required. Also note that the water-buses are of limited capacity, so you might end up waiting additional 30 minutes for the next boat. Alternatively, from the same jetty, you can travel in style (and much faster) by hiring one of the speedy water-taxis (30 mins) for about &#8364;110. All these tickets are now buyable online, as well as the airport waterbus route map, at <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://venicelink.com">Venicelink.com</a>
<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://trevisoairport.it/">Treviso Airport</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICAO" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:ICAO">ICAO</a>: <b>LIPH</b>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IATA" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:IATA">IATA</a>: <b>TSF</b>), located 25&#160;km (16&#160;mi) from Venice, is relatively small but becoming increasingly busy as the main destination for Ryanair, Wizzair, and Transavia budget flights. From Treviso Airport to Venice and Mestre, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://en.barziservice.com/services/airport-line-1-treviso-airportmestrevenice-piazzale-roma/line-treviso-airport-mestre-railway-venice-piazzale-roma-in-40-minutes-by-highway.html">Barzi Bus Service</a> offers a â¬13 round-trip ticket price to Venice. These tickets are also available on their bus.
The <b>San Nicolo Airport</b> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICAO" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:ICAO">ICAO</a>: <b>LIPV</b>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IATA" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:IATA">IATA</a>: <b>ATC</b>) is an airfield directly on the Lido. It handles only small aircraft, as the runway (grass) is about 1&#160;km long, and does not have any scheduled flights, but might be of interest to private pilots (arrivals from <a href="/en/Schengen" title="Schengen">Schengen</a> states only) due to its convenience to the city (it is a short walk to the vaporetto landing).
Trains from the mainland run through <a href="/en/Mestre" title="Mestre">Mestre</a> to the <b>Venezia Santa Lucia</b> train station on the west side of Venice; make sure you don't get confused with <b>Venezia Mestre</b> which is the last stop on the mainland. From the station district, water buses (<i>vaporetti</i>) or water taxis can take you to hotels or other locations on the islands, but walking is usually the best option. Direct trains to Venice are available from many international destinations, there are overnight trains from <a href="/en/Munich" title="Munich">Munich</a>, <a href="/en/Paris" title="Paris">Paris</a> and <a href="/en/Vienna" title="Vienna">Vienna</a> and also a weekly long-distance night train (four nights) from <a href="/en/Moscow" title="Moscow">Moscow</a> via <a href="/en/Kiev" title="Kiev">Kiev</a>, <a href="/en/Budapest" title="Budapest">Budapest</a> and <a href="/en/Zagreb" title="Zagreb">Zagreb</a>. One of the best ways to arrive to Venice by train is with the legendary <a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Venice_Simplon-Orient-Express&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Venice Simplon-Orient-Express (page does not exist)">Venice Simplon-Orient-Express</a>. The local handling agent can do reservations and take care of all the transfers from the train when you arrive. Venice is well-connected with the domestic train network, <a href="/en/Rome" title="Rome">Rome</a> and <a href="/en/Milano" title="Milano" class="mw-redirect">Milano</a> are only a few hours away. Also there are some night trains from cities in southern Italy, though since 2012 most services have been cancelled.
Cars arrive on the far western edge of Venice, but remain parked at the entrance to the city (Piazzale Roma or Tronchetto - Europe's largest car park.) There are no roads past this point -- and never were, even before cars. Car parking is very very expensive here (26 â¬/12h, 30 â¬/24h) and the tailbacks can be quite large. An alternative is to use the car parks on the mainland (terra ferma) and catch a train or bus or vaporetto into Venice. Park near the <a href="/en/Mestre" title="Mestre">Mestre</a> railway station, and catch a train to Venezia St.Lucia; there are many trains, it is very near (8-10 minutes) and quite cheap (â¬ 1,20). Don't bother searching for free parking near Mestre train station - there are no free parking spots near, except on sunday (free parking is on the other side of the station, in Marghera). Free and safe parkings are also near Mogliano Veneto and Oriago railway stations. Besides, Venezia St. Lucia is a good starting point to visit Venice. However drivers going to the Lido can use the car ferry from Tronchetto (vaporetto 17 - frequencies vary), right hand lane off the Ponte della LibertÃ  into the city.
Another place for free parking in Mestre is the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.mestre.it/pages/contenuti/index.php?content_id=55">council car park</a>
Those with "Gratuito" are parking lots which are totally free. Many have bus stops right next to them and many go direct to Venice without changing buses.
Most of the major rental car companies have outlets at Piazzale Roma, at the edge of the city. These are on the ground floor of one of the major parking stations. When you are dropping off your car, you need to find street parking and then walk to the rental car outlet and hand in the keys. Do not park in the parking station! There is a vaporetto stop across the road from the parking station.
There is a direct bus between Marco Polo airport and the Piazzale Roma, on the west bank of Venice operated by ATVO <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.atvo.it/index.php?lang=en&amp;area=23&amp;menuid=35">[1]</a>. Starts twice an hour, takes 20 minutes and costs â¬6 one way and 11â¬ for a round trip. The buses run from the airport till about midnight but stop sooner on the Venice to Airport route. The Piazzale Roma bus station is well served by vaporetti and water-taxis ... and of course, you can walk everywhere.
From <a href="/en/Mestre" title="Mestre">Mestre</a>, you can take a bus to Venice - Piazzale Roma. The ticket costs â¬2.50 roundtrip and you must buy bus tickets from specialized ticket kiosks and vending machines, as well as tobacconists and newsstands.
Ships arrive at the <b>Stazione Marittima</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.vtp.it/">[2]</a> which is at the west end of the main islands, it is served by vaporetti and water taxis.
Venice, the world's only pedestrian city, is easily walkable, and the absence of cars makes this a particularly pleasant experience. However, walking and standing all day can also be exhausting, so it is best to pace yourself. The Rialtine islands - the 'main' part of Venice - are small enough to walk from one end to the other in about an hour, provided you don't get lost (a common occurrence).
If you want to get around a bit more quickly, there are numerous <b>vaporetti (water buses)</b> and <b>water taxis</b>. The vaporetti are generally the best way to get around, even if the service route map changes frequently. If you are going to be in Venice for a few days visiting, it is a lot cheaper to use vaporetti than private water taxis. If you want to have a romantic ride along the canals, take a gondola ride, although they tend to exist for more scenic purposes, rather than getting people from point A to point B.
Thanks to the <b>Vaporetto dellâArte</b> you can discover Venice and its magnificent treasures along the Grand Canal. It stops at the most charming attractions and museums in Venice and many services are available on board, such as a multilingual audio video system. You can book <i>Vaporetto dellâArte</i> tickets online with different validity periods (from 12 hours up to 7 days) and they allow you to hop on and off according to your needs and interests over a period of time to visit museums, exhibitions and monuments listed in the information kit you receive on board.
<b>Travelcard</b>
<b>ACTV</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.actv.it/en">[3]</a> runs the vaporetti and other public transport services both in the lagoon and on <i>terra firma</i>. Travel cards are extremely useful since the basic fare for one vaporetto journey is typically &#8364;7.00.  There are other versions available, including those offering discounts for youth under 29 year of age. Current rates can be found here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.actv.it/en/movinginvenice/movinginvenice">[4]</a>. 
The vaporetti uses an honesty system, meaning you are expected to validate your ticket at the stop before boarding, but there's nobody making sure you do so (except at the busy Piazzale Roma stop), and checks on the crowded vaporetti are extremely rare.
Since 2009 the Venice Connected <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://veniceconnected.com">[5]</a> website of the Comune di Venezia makes possible to book online (at least 7 days in advance) most services controlled by the town administration (public transportation, access to the civic museums, access to public restrooms, car park tickets, entrance to the CasinÃ² and access to the municipal WiFi network covering the entire historic centre); the online prices vary according to the projected number of visitors but are always cheaper than the current on-site prices (and cheaper than with a Venice Card).
You can also get a Venice Card, which has various options that you can choose when you buy it (public transportation, cultural attractions, toilet access, Alilaguna, etc.) There is a 'Junior' version of the Venice that is available at a slightly reduced rate for those between 5 and 29 years of age. Note, however, that a Venice Card is not recommended for those with less than 3 days in Venice, as most of the top attractions are not included in the Venice Card. If you'll be staying in Venice for a week - get the Venice Card and enjoy travelling from island to island and exploring the various museums and churches it offers access to.
Maps are available at the vaporetto stops in the ticket booths. The map is quite reliable, and is free when getting a Venice Card (&#8364;2 otherwise), or view the map here <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.venice.nu/vapmap/vapomapLatest.jpg">[6]</a>
Venice Cards can be reserved on-line for a considerable discount here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.hellovenezia.com/index.php?lang=en">[7]</a>. Keep in mind, though, that there are long lines when taking the Venice Card from the ticket booths. The Venezia St. Lucia ticket booth that offers Venice Cards is the one most on the right when you exit the train station.
Otherwise, <b>take a walk</b>!  The city is not that big, and you can walk from one end to the other in a few hours (if you stick to the paths conveniently marked with arrows in the direction of major landmarks). But it would take months for a fit person to discover every path in the city. Along the way you will discover marvelous art, superb architecture and breathtaking urban landscaping. Exploring the city randomly by walking is well worth it but also be prepared to get lost easily! Signs all over the city indicate the direction to the main attractions, "Rialto" and "San Marco", as well as the way back to the train station ("ferrovia") and the bus terminal ("Piazzale Roma"). These signs make it easy to have the "get lost experience" even as a one-day tourist.
Be aware that addresses in Venice are of the form DISTRICT NUMBER (The Venetian word for district is "Sestriere"), not STREET NUMBER. To find a specific place using a map, make sure you know which district it is in. The numbers are assigned at the start of the district and increase as they move farther away from the Grand Canal.
Although San Marco is free, other famous churches charge an entry fee. If you plan to visit three churches or more,  you are better off buying the churches pass. There is also a combined pass for museums, churches and transportation only available at the tourist information office but it is relatively expensive.
Half a dozen of the museums at Saint Marc's are covered by one â¬14 admission ticket, including Doge's Palace and the Correr Museum.
There is another museum pass for â¬18, which covers a further one dozen museums.
Other museums include:
<b>Voga Longa</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.vogalonga.it/">[18]</a>, the yearly equivalent of a marathon run on water. Voga Longa competitors must row 32 kilometers under 3.5 hours to receive a certificate of attendance at the finish line, but everybody with a human-powered vessel is welcome to participate (some foreigner teams take up to 10 hours to complete the journey just for the fun of it).
The official purpose of the Voga Longa was to protest the sharply increasing use of powerboats in Venice, but the event has gradually grown into a festival since 1974, with up to 5500 racers in 1500 vessels attending by the early 2000s. The racetrack visits different parts of Venice as well as some of the nearby islands. Locals and tourists lining up alongside rios and canals cheer the racers.
Visitors wishing to participate should have serious experience in rowing or sculling and practice duely, as the journey is physically demanding (even seasoned oarsmen develop calluses by the finish line). The event is mainly for teams, completing Voga Longa on a single oar is considered a major achievement. Extreme participation (scuba frogmen and surface swimmers) sometimes occurs, but it is not recommended due to water contamination issues.
<b>Regata 'Storica</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://regatastoricavenezia.it/">[19]</a> (Historic fleet event) is held on the first Sunday of every September. Celebrating a historic event from 1489, the regatta displays almost a hundred varieties of venetian boats from the city's rich past. Large oarships, replicating ancient roman and medieval vessels, are rowed along the Canal Grande, followed by many smaller boats. There are several races, including a master championship for solo sculling in streamlined gondolini, painted in unusual white, pink, etc. colours. There are many excellent photo opportunities for this event.
<b>La Biennale di Venezia</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.labiennale.org/en/Home.html">[20]</a> is one of the most well known culture institutions. Two events organised by Biennale are the Art and Architecture International Exhibitions happening alternately (Architecture Biennale in even years, Art Biennale in odd) but other fields are also covered - contemporary theatre, dance, music, cinema (<b>Venice International Film Festival</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.labiennale.org/en/cinema/festival/">[21]</a>).
Exhibitions take place mostly in two locations: <b>Arsenale</b> and <b>Giardini</b>. They are both worth visiting even when no event is scheduled. Arsenale is the largest pre-industrial production centre in the world, dating back to 13th century, and Giardini is architectural gem filled with national pavilions from different parts of the world, often designed by famous architects, it was a venue for the International Art Exhibition since 19th century.
Ride a <b>Vaporetto</b> (Water Bus) down the Grand Canal right before sunset.  The Vaporettos are expensive, but the sights are priceless: amazing architecture, soft seaside sunlight, and a fascinating parade of Venetian watercraft.
Take a <b>Gondola</b> if you can afford it: it's expensive, but the <i>Gondoliere</i> may decrease the price if you ask (but they can also decrease the time...). Make sure you reach an agreement on price and time before you start!  A good tip with the Gondolieres is to bargain the price down as low as you can, then say that it's still too much and walk away.  Two or three of them will chase after you, one after the other, each offering a lower price than the last.  It's possible to knock â¬20-â¬30 off the price(even then, be prepared to shell out â¬80).
Some guidebooks discourage tourists from asking for gondola price reductions. The oarsmen have an informal habit of cutting the most interesting and little-known parts from the journey path for "discount" customers. Reduced rate riders get much less marvel in exchange for a moderate price drop, which may not be worth it.
Gondolier-for-hire business licenses are officially limited to just 430 to 455 rowers in Venice, making the market artificially scarce and inflating prices. Gondola rides are always costly, often in a princely way and that expense should be planned in advance of the visit<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://gondolatour.com/en/itinerari.php">[22]</a>. If you go as a group it might be cheaper, though the number of people who can be accommodated on a gondola varies, usually up to a maximum of six seated passangers. The "traghetti" holds more, mostly standing, as a pair of gondoliers rows short distances for canal crossing purposes at a number of points along the Grand Canal.
If a gondola seems a little pricey,  the alternative is to cross the Grand Canal by <b>traghetto</b>.  These only cost â¬0.50 to use and are largely gondolas that have seen better days, They are stripped down and used as municipal ferries.  In the 1950's there were as many as thirty, but now there are seven points to find them. However some only operate when people are going to and from work. The length of any crossing is just a few minutes. Many visitors enjoy visiting the open air markets near the Rialto Bridge and there is a traghetto station there, at the <b>Pescheria</b> (fish market) joining the Santa Sophia church along the Strada Nova. You will notice that traghetti passengers tend to <b>stand up</b>, but if you are not comfortable doing so, sitting is possible, if you are careful. The more adventurous can try the venetian style of rowing through Row Venice or one of the many rowing clubs
If you are looking for something to do, you can always <b>shop</b>. Venice is packed full of little stores in every corner and crevice. The commonest local specialties are Carnival masks, glass, and marbled paper.  Price can vary wildly, so it's a good idea to hold off buying until you have a fair idea about the relative value of things. As is the case with most tourist cities, a LOT of the "original " and "made in Venice" items are actually made in China. <a href="/en/Murano" title="Murano">Murano</a> is an island famous for its glass making. Almost in every shop you will find "original <a href="/en/Murano" title="Murano">Murano</a> glass" items. If it was really made in <a href="/en/Murano" title="Murano">Murano</a>, it would be prohibitively expensive, with prices routinely running into thousands of euros. So if you are looking for cheap souvenirs, real <a href="/en/Murano" title="Murano">Murano</a> glass is not the thing to buy! You can also see glass making demonstrations in <a href="/en/Murano" title="Murano">Murano</a>, but be sure to check that there is a demonstration scheduled for that day. And it is normally not done in winter either.
Spend a <b>day on the islands</b>, mainly <a href="/en/Murano" title="Murano">Murano</a>, <a href="/en/Burano" title="Burano">Burano</a> and Torcello. There are boat services to all these islands at scheduled times, including between the islands themselves. Be prepared for long lines and long waits for the boats between islands.
The Glass Museum in <a href="/en/Murano" title="Murano">Murano</a> and the Lace Museum in <a href="/en/Burano" title="Burano">Burano</a> are certainly worth a visit. In <a href="/en/Burano" title="Burano">Burano</a> you will find some of the most picturesque streets and houses, with each house sporting a different pastel shade. Its really beautiful. Though there is not much to see in Torcello except for the old church, and the supposed "Throne of Atilla". However, the peace and tranquility of the island is not to be found anywhere else in Venice! Torcello is also home to a very expensive Cipriani restaurant. But just walking around on these islands is a nice enough experience. If you've had enough of the hype and the other tourists, hop off the vaporetto at 'Cimitero', Venice's graveyard for a peaceful walk. There are many famous tombs, and the section dedicated to deceased children is particularly haunting. There is also a free toilet there.
While going through Venice, make sure you take in the beauty of it all. <b>Walk</b> through the alley ways, and take the water taxi to different parts of the island, sometimes at night you can just go sit in an open area and watch locals and tourists passing by. It is wonderful. There are many museums and churches that are around the city that allow tourists to go in a visit. They are many great sights to keep you busy throughout your visit.
The  âSecret Itineraries in <b>Doge's Palace</b>â <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://museiciviciveneziani.it/main.asp?lin=EN">[23]</a> worth a visit, take the visitor into the most secret and fascinating rooms in the Palace. Itâs better to book in advance.
Because Venice is now pretty much only inhabited by tourists and people serving the trade, it gets very quiet by 9.00 and there is very little to do in the evening (outside of eating).  There are a few exceptions, like some classical music <b>concerts,</b> which most probably only play Vivaldi.
If you would like to have a <b>guide</b> to show up the highlights of Venice, you can choose between many offers. There are walking or boat tours, focused on shopping or history or for art lovers, and many itineraries.
If you are interested in exploring all things related with Italian <b>food</b> you have to visit the freshly open "i Tre Mercanti" <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://itremercanti.it">[24]</a> (campo della guerra 2 mins from S.Marco square) an amazing food gallery where you can find typical Italian specialties, a wide range of the best wines and the usual classics like Olive Oil, balsamic vinegar, parmesan, Limoncello along with hundreds of regional specialities (including 97 pasta sauces!). Classy and friendly the staff speak many languages and is open every day. If you don't feel like shopping you can always browse the shop and ask cooking tips and the history of products to the helpful manager.
Send a <b>Postcard</b> or even better, an entire <b>mail</b> dedicated to an important one (the old "snail mail" one, not the electronic variety)! Venice has a long, celebrated tradition in postal services, paper and written communication in general (including one of the earliest medival book printing houses).
Venice it's also <b>Riviera del Brenta</b> old canals. 
The Riviera del Brenta is famous for its extraordinary Palladian villas along the Brenta river, its museums and historical buildings and it is located only 25 miles from Venice. 
This Riviera and its mainland include 7 small cities: Stra, Fiesso dâArtico, Dolo, FossÃ², Mira, Oriago and Malcontenta.
These places are indicated for <b>cycling excusions</b> and to see antique Palladian Villas built on the Brenta river. In Stra village the <b>famous gardens of Villa Pisani</b> and the <b>museum of the shoes</b> in Villa Foscarini Rossi. In this last museum you can admire 1500 models of made in Italy shoes created from local factories for major brands included Fendi, Genny, Yves Saint Laurent, Givenchy, Ungaro, Anne Kleyn, Richard Tyles, Vera Wang and much more.
In Dolo village you can visit the square, old watermill (XI century)and big open air market.
Venice is home to two major (and expanding) universities, Ca' Foscari (Public) and IUAV (Public).  There are possibly hundreds of smaller schools in the city. Neither university exploits its name for merchandising, and "UniversitÃ  degli Studi di Venezia" sweatshirts for sale at stalls are not only unlicensed, but there is no single university in the city with that name to begin with.
If you've come to Venice thinking that you won't be able to do a bit of designer shopping, think again! Just like in every major Italian city, you get the big fashion brand names here too. For label clothing shopping, the best area is that around the Piazza San Marco, where you can find Versace, MaxMara, Gucci, Armani, Louis Vuitton, Prada (and numerous more) big names. If you want to shop for clothing or accessories, though, you don't necessarily have to shop through the biggest names in fashion - in the Campo Santo Stefano and Calle della Mandola, you can get less famous or local boutiques, but you can find some excellent quality and/or unique items such as clothes, shoes, wallets, or handbags.
Watch out also for the hand-made paper and the exquisite miniature buildings made by Moro. Watch out for fakes; Moro "signs" his name on the back. Also, beware of fakes and "free" trips to neighboring <a href="/en/Murano" title="Murano">Murano</a> for its famous glass. (See article for details.)
Tourist Traps: "Coloured Pasta" and "Venetian Limoncello" (not the original napolitan one) are not Italian food, no Italian would ever eat them, they are particularly made for tourists, only buy typical regional Italian food in food shops and always check the labels to discover where they have been made. In case it is not stated on the label, avoid the purchase.
Venice has some wonderful restaurants, featuring the cuisine of the Veneto. However it is widely regarded that the restaurants in Venice serve food of a quality and in quantities much lower than anywhere else in Italy. The pizza in Venice is well known as being the worst in Italy (It is a more southern italian speciality). For Americans, you can find a place called Quanto Basta pizza that serves an American-style pizza with pepperoni and french fries. Specialties include polenta, made of corn meal; risotto with cuttlefish ink sauce. Diners should however be aware that for every genuinely wonderful restaurant or trattoria, there's another serving rubbish food at inflated prices, especially in the most touristed streets around San Marco. Rule of thumb: if there's a waiter outside pimping for business, it's probably best avoided.
Near the Rialto bridge there's a row of restaurants with tables by the canal, where you can have the quintessential Venice experience of dining by the canal lights. Although they do have waiters outside bugging you, some have pretty acceptable quality for price, which is almost always expensive anyway.
In Venice, as in many other Italian cities, people meet before dinner for the ritual of happy hour at a so called â<b>bacari</b>â, that is characteristic osterias or wine bars where you can find a lively and genuine atmosphere. Here you can drink some typical aperitifs such as the famous âspritzâ (a cocktail made of Prosecco wine and Aperol or Campari) or taste the âcicchettiâ (tasty snacks, such as small croutons, meat cooked on a spit, savoury pastries and typical Venetian dishes, both hot and cold, fried and not).
One of Venice's trademark foods is cuttlefish and its ink. This intense black ink serves as a sauce and ingredient for polenta (corn meal), risotto (rice), and pasta. These dishes are normally indicated by the Italian words "nella seppia" (in cuttlefish), "alla seppia" (in the style of cuttlefish), or "nero di seppia," (black of the cuttlefish). For example Polenta Nella Seppia is fried corn meal with the black ink of a cuttle fish. Despite the intensity in color, the ink has a surprisingly mild taste.
Be careful when the prices are on a weight basis (typically by the "etto", abbreviated "/hg". or 100 g). One dish can easily contain 400g of fish or meat (almost a pound) - coming to 4 times the indicated base price!
Restaurants might offer low prices for food on their menus that they advertise outside the entrance, but they will sometimes compensate this by charging high prices for drinks (which is naturally *not* advertised). â¬5 for 33 cl of beer is not uncommon. Le Bauta, an eatery on Fond del Gaffaro, is a good example. Also, please make sure that you get your change back after payment as sometimes it may be 'forgotten' by the waiters.
For fresh fruit (including chilled coconut) watch out for the street market stalls. There is always a boat parked in the canal on campo San Barnaba selling fruit and vegetables into the late hours.
To save money at lunch, eat standing up - that's what Venetians themselves do. Every cafe, trattoria, osteria, enoteca or whatever it chooses to call itself is stocked at lunchtime with cicchetti - Venetian tapas, including tramezzini (triangular sandwiches on white bread), bite-sized rolls with various cold cuts, polpette (fried balls of minced fish or meat) and assorted antipasti. Order by pointing at what you want on the glass shelves, and wash the whole thing down with a glass of wine (un' ombra) or a spritz (made with, in order of bitterness and alcohol content, Aperol, Campari or Select). Bear in mind that as soon as you allow yourself to sit at the table and be waited on, instead of ordering and consuming your food at the counter, the prices for the same items go up - you can end up paying double. If you look at the (government-mandated) chart of prices stapled to the wall near the bar, you'll see 2 columns of numbers, accommodating this arrangement. However, sitting is worth it if you plan on staying a while. Some places will also serve bread and water for seated patrons, but then there is usually also a small charge (â¬1-3 per person) for "pane e coperto" (bread and cover charge).
If self-catering, the Rialto food markets are an absolute must for fruit, vegetables and cheese, but most of all for the huge range of seafood, much of it fresh out of the lagoon and still moving! There are a variety of small stores around the city that sell fruits and vegetables, but tourists will be hard-pressed to find them. Anything else you will find in the one of the few supermarkets in the city.
Head to the Dorsoduro area of Venice if you want to save a few euros. It is located on the south side of the city. It has the highest concentration of places where locals, especially students, go to eat.  Generally staying away from the main squares will be the cheapest option.  If you're willing and able to walk around the town, some back streets offer the best food for the lowest price.  Seeing the city from this vantage point is a lot of fun too!

You will find ice cream all over the city, and you will hardly survive a hot summer day without. Prices are 1 - 1.50â¬ for one scoop, 2.50 - 3.50â¬ for three scoops.
<b>Beer</b> in a small pub is about â¬5 for a pint (birra media).
<b>Espresso</b>, the real italian, is about â¬1 at the bar, â¬2 at a table.
Coffee is everywhere in Venice, and both Venetians and the tourists avail themselves of the opportunities, usually by downing a quick dose at the counter (see warning about sit-down prices above). Rule of thumb: the bigger (and shinier) the espresso machine, the better the result. One of the favorites is the mini-chain <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.rosasalva.it/">"E Rosa Salva"</a>, with three locations in the center - on C. Fiubera (from Piazza San Marco, take the underpass in the middle of the arcade, cross the bridge and take second right off C. Fabbri), Merceria S. Salvadore (off the campo of the same name), and right on Campo San Zanipolo (to the right of the church looking from the canal); the last one is a gelateria as well. For your â¬1 you'll get exactly 2 and a half sips at the bottom of a small cup, with rich crema and no bitterness. Assorted house-made sweets are â¬1.10.
There are two late-night drinking areas in Venice.  Piazza San Marco is not one of them.  Although it is very pleasant and there are many people wandering around late.  But the actual late night scene is in either <b>Campo Santa Margherita</b>, near the University Ca' Foscari in Dorsoduro; or in <b>Erbaria</b> on the West side of the Rialto Bridge where the main vegetable market is held during the day.
Although there are many fantastic bars in Venice, if you're planning a night time "pub crawl" you should plan a few places to visit in advance, otherwise it's very easy to waste an hour wandering aimlessly in search of a watering hole that's actually open (especially midweek).
Locals in search of nighttime entertainment mostly head over the bridge into Mestre, or hop the boat to Lido. One exception: F.ta della Misericordia, in Cannaregio (north from the Ghetto over the Ghetto Nuove bridge, turn right), features several bars in succession, anchored by the <i>Paradiso Perduto</i> (Cannaregio 2640; a restaurant by day, live music on Sundays starting at 9), along the canal. In season they are spilling over after dark with youths holding large glasses of ros&#233;, while more of those same youths are cruising (in motor boats) blaring rap songs in Italian from the loudspeakers. The cafes and bars lining the expansive C. Santa Margherita are catering to the students from the nearby university; chill out to reggae sets in <i>CaffÃ© Rosso</i> (Dorsoduro 2963), or dance (Saturdays only) at <i>Round Midnight</i> (Dorsoduro 3102).

Due to Venice's historic city constrained area and touristic importance hotels are expensive. Bed and Breakfasts and guesthouses offer better rates, and real budget solutions (like campings and hostels) can be found on <a href="/en/Mestre" title="Mestre">mainland Venice</a> and <a href="/en/Lido" title="Lido">Lido</a>. These are worth considering since historic centre is quite well connected with bus and ferries, so staying outside is not such a big problem.
In the last few years,  holiday or short rentals apartments have increased in number and quality, now you can rent (minimum stay is usually 3 nights) a Palazzo on the Grand Canal as a little flat near Rialto.

The area code is 041. As anywhere in Italy, it is compulsory to dial the area code and the number also if you call from the city itself. If you call from abroad, dial +39041 before the number. If you call abroad from Venice, dial 00 first.
Venice has several internet cafes, but they are much more expensive than the rest of Europe with prices for an hour of access around â¬6. Wi-Fi is only available at some of them. There's a wonderful pub, Cafe Blue in Dorsoduro, which has free (password-protected) Wi-Fi. Buy a spritz and some panini and go to town.
At the Telecom Italia Future Centre in Campo San Salvatore (San Marco) you can browse for free for one hour, once registered with your ID card.
If you buy any of the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://veniceconnected.com/">VeniceCard</a> products (transport and museum entrance in various combinations) of 24 or more hours' duration, it will automatically include, either at no additional charge or for an extra â¬3 depending on the season, the access codes for the municipal wireless network. There are currently two areas covered by the hotspots: one is the San Marco Square and the other San Giuliano Park (which is actually on the mainland, to the north of the bridge entrance).
To use an Internet cafe, buy a mobile SIM card or get a contract for an Internet connection. Personal identification is needed by law in Italy.  Internet cafes will not let you use computers without a passport or national ID card.
<b>Calle Delle Botteghe</b>, San Marco. A very pretty art gallery type internet cafe with a book shop.  It is on the expensive side with â¬3 for 15 min but you can just go in and play chess with a glass of wine.
Venice is considered a safe city.  You have to take the habitual travelers' precautions, however. Keep your valuable items (like wallet and passport) close to you because there are pickpockets, especially in more crowded parts of the city. In addition, make sure you get receipts for all of your purchases (in order to fight tax evasion). Italian law requires customers to retain receipts and you could (in theory) be stopped by the Financial Police and asked to show receipts for your purchases.
In case of need, you can dial free of charge on any phone <b>112</b> (no area code needed) to contact Carabinieri or <b>113</b> (no area code needed) to contact the Police.
Venice has begun to install septic tanks in buildings, but much of the city has not yet been upgraded and releases untreated sewage directly into the canals.  Avoid bathing yourself, touching the water, immersing feet, etc. in the canals looking for refreshment in the hot season.
Also, at night there is a risk of falling into the water, as there are many alleys which end in the water but have little or no lighting.  In the warmest months, these conditions can generate sometimes foul odors.  Choose other times to visit if they might ruin what should be a highly-enjoyable visit.
Beware where you put your feet: pet owners are not often polite and leave everything their friends by-produce on the ground (this may apply to humans too). Small, dark, back alleys are often similar to mine fields.
You can reach the emergency medical service dialling free of charge on any phone <b>118</b> (no area code needed - conversation will be recorded) to have assistance and an ambulance sent to you.
Chemists' shops (Italian: <i>Farmacie</i>) are all around the town. They are open 24hrs. a day  / 7 days a week on a rotational basis: outside the shop there's always the list of operating ones with time-table, address and phone number.
If you need a special-treatment drug you might be asked to book it in advance if it's not of so common use. Please, note that the commercial name or brand of your prescription might differ from your country of origin. Make sure before leaving your country of origin that you can have all you need even in the EU.
The unfortunate side-effect of the quaint back-alleys which make Venice such a delight to visit is that it is remarkably easy to get lost. Even maps provided by hotels are frequently inaccurate, and the maze-like structure of the city can become very confusing indeed. The tight cluster of little islands that comprise Venice is completely surrounded by the Lagoon, so it is not possible, no matter how lost you become, to leave Venice on foot. Sooner or later you will come upon a piazza that you can locate on your map.
One tip: as you cross bridges, note the house numbers before and after.  A small change probably means you are on the same island/district and have crossed a "new" canal.  A major change means you are now on another island.  Most maps clump islands together into their voting districts, there are many more islands than districts.
One piece of assistance is to look for directional signs. These will be marked "Per" and then with the name of a prominent location or bridge in the city, complete with an arrow pointing in the relevant direction. Hence, to get to the Rialto bridge, the signs to follow are marked "Per Rialto". Those to St Mark's Square read "Per S Marco", and those to the train station "Per Ferrovia" (there are some others as well). Having oriented yourself to the nearest landmark, direction-finding can thus become (slightly) easier.
Remember, though, that the signs to read are the <i>official</i> ones. Graffiti will occasionally give other directions, frequently incorrect ones.
That said, some argue that getting lost in Venice is part of the experience of the city. The number of photogenic canals, hidden restaurants and shops where glass blowing is done almost guarantees that there is no such thing as a "dull neighbourhood". Additionally, the public transport means that it is relatively easy to arrive at the intended destination even after one has emerged from the web of alleys in a totally unexpected place.
Around the Venetian lagoon are other smaller islands, which have since been deserted but are worth a visit. There is also the Lido, which is a long narrow island with more modern buildings, hosting a youth hostel and a hotel.
