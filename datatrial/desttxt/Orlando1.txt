<b>Orlando</b> is a large city located in <a href="/en/Orange_County_(Florida)" title="Orange County (Florida)">Orange County</a>, <a href="/en/Florida" title="Florida">Florida</a>.
Orlando, for most people, conjures up the image of theme parks, mainly <a href="/en/Walt_Disney_World" title="Walt Disney World">Walt Disney World</a>, but there is a lot more. (In fact, Disney World is not in Orlando, but is in nearby <a href="/en/Lake_Buena_Vista" title="Lake Buena Vista">Lake Buena Vista</a>). With the estimated 52 million tourists a year, Orlando and many other areas in the region developed a lot to offer a traveler who wants to see something other than a theme park.
Other cities in the metropolitan area include <a href="/en/Altamonte_Springs" title="Altamonte Springs">Altamonte Springs</a>, <a href="/en/Davenport_(Florida)" title="Davenport (Florida)">Davenport</a>, <a href="/en/Kissimmee" title="Kissimmee">Kissimmee</a>, and <a href="/en/Winter_Park_(Florida)" title="Winter Park (Florida)">Winter Park</a>.
When people think of Orlando, most think of theme parks and a vast urban sprawl. However, the city proper contains none of the major theme parks (Disney World, Universal Studios, Sea World), dinner attractions (Arabian Nights, Medieval Times), or even most small theme parks (Gatorland, Holyland Experience, Ripley's Believe-it-or-not, etc). However, since Orlando is the larger city associated with most of these popular attractions, you will find details and descriptions of them below.
Most tourists visit Orlando between June and August, while another peak time for tourism is March and April. Ironically, the less busy times for tourism correspond to the best weather in the Orlando area; the summer months can be exceptionally busy with families who are making a trip while kids are on summer vacation. Visiting when the weather isn't so hot means less people in the area and that provides some advantages, but you will be able to enjoy cooler weather.
<br />
Many say central Florida has two seasons: hot and hotter. Orlando has warm, balmy springs and autumns; hot summers complete with daily thunderstorms; and temperate winters affected by the occasional cold front. That being said:
<b>Florida Cold &amp; Snow</b><br />
While most think of Florida as a year-round paradise, many would be surprised to learn that there are at least ten clear winter mornings a year when lows fall to near freezing.  However, even on the coldest of mornings, highs will soon reach into the 50s and 60s! Nevertheless, every 3-4 years, snow flurries will mix with rain somewhere in the region, the most recent being 3 January, 2008. However, only once since records began in 1948 has any measurable snow fall at the airport (0.2" in/0.5 cm Jan 1977). So if you visit between November and March, bring a jacket...it may be warmer than northern states, but not as warm as you may think it will be!
<b>Orlando International Airport</b> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IATA" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:IATA">IATA</a>: <b>MCO</b>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.orlandoairports.net/">[1]</a>) is the city's primary airport, and the busiest airport in the state in terms of passenger traffic. The airport is located to the southeast of downtown but is centrally located with respect to the region and area attractions. Orlando International Airport is a secondary hub for AirTran Airways, Southwest Airlines, &amp; JetBlue Airways, all of which fly numerous routes to/from Orlando. Furthermore, Delta Air Lines offers 10-15 flights daily between Orlando and their super-hub in <a href="/en/Atlanta" title="Atlanta">Atlanta</a> and American Airlines has 9 flights a day to their Miami hub. Non-stop service is offered to nearly every major city east of the Mississippi and to several major western cities (LA, San Francisco, Seattle, Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City, &amp; Denver).
Daily flights to Europe are offered by Virgin Atlantic (London-Gatwick &amp; Manchester), British Airways (London-Gatwick), &amp; Lufthansa (Frankfurt). Multiple flights per week are flown to Dublin (Aer Lingus), Paris (Air France, ends Sep. 2012), Glasgow (Virgin Atlantic, seasonally), &amp; Zurich (Swiss Int./Edelweiss Air). To South America, there are daily flights to Sao Paulo (TAM) &amp; Bogata (Jet Blue) and seasonal service to Santiago, Chile (LAN). Over a dozen Canadian destinations are served non-stop, many seasonally (Toronto &amp; Montreal are served daily year-round). Other international destinations served from Orlando include: Jamaica (Montego Bay), the Dominican Republic (Santo Domingo), the Bahamas (Nassau), Mexico (Cancun, Mexico City), Panama (Panama City), Costa Rica (San JosÃ©), &amp; El Salvador (San Salvador). The airport was approved in 2012 to begin Cuba flights.
Orlando International is structured into two components, landside and airside.  There is a central landside terminal (A and B), containing airline counters, baggage claim, rental agencies, numerous shops, and a hotel.  This central terminal is connected via trams to four other terminals, known as Airside 1-4, with the airplane gates. There are plenty of shops and restaurants in both the central terminal and the airsides.
Security screening is performed in the central landside terminal before taking the tram to the airsides and, as in all U.S. airports, only ticketed passengers are allowed past security.  Security lines can become extremely long (1 hr), especially during the summer tourist season and near holidays. Combined with long check-in lines, it is advisable to arrive 2-3 hours before your scheduled departure.
Almost every medium to high priced hotel in the city offers transfers. Orlando is the rental car capital of the world and as such there are several car rental agencies offering a wide range of vehicles for rental.
There are several <b>Shuttle and Town Car services</b> options that run from the airport to various points, including Kissimmee, theme parks, University of Central Florida, and the cruise port at <a href="/en/Cape_Canaveral" title="Cape Canaveral">Port Canaveral</a>.

A secondary airport which serves the Orlando area is the Orlando-Sanford International Airport (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IATA" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:IATA">IATA</a>: <b>SFB</b>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.orlandosanfordairport.com/">[12]</a>) located in <a href="/en/Sanford_(Florida)" title="Sanford (Florida)">Sanford</a>, a city just to the north of Orlando, the side of Orlando opposite most attractions.

In addition, Orlando area visitors who plan on visiting the Gulf Coast may consider flying into <a href="/en/Tampa#By_plane" title="Tampa">Tampa International Airport</a>, about 80 mi (130 km) west of Orlando or just over an hour's drive, as it is less crowded and a bit easier to access via road.
If you plan on visiting more than just Orlando and plan on taking international flights, you may want to consider flying via <a href="/en/Miami#By_plane" title="Miami">Miami International Airport</a>, a 200 mi (320 km) and a 3-4 hour drive south of Orlando, which offers more international flights and is the largest US gateway for flights to South/Central America and the Caribbean.
All persons flying via general aviation should consider arriving via Orlando Executive Airport, 3 mi east of downtown and about 10 or so miles (16km) north of Orlando International Airport. Orlando Executive serves general aviation (95%) and air taxi (5%) exclusively. Additionally, Orlando Sanford International serves general aviation alongside its commercial use.
Orlando Executive Airport provides 24 h service through two fixed based operators, SheltAir Aviation Services and Showalter Flying Services. Air taxi and air charter companies such as <b>Jetset Charter</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.jscharter.com">[13]</a> fly a variety of private charter aircraft and jets, from charter luxury Gulfstream's down to economical piston twins for small groups and individuals.

Driving to Orlando should be considered as a real and viable possibility for anyone with the geographic means. All Orlando attractions, including most major resorts and hotels are conveniently located off Interstate 95, running from Maine to Florida. Five minutes off of a choice of exits, depending on your destination, takes you anywhere you need to go. This can prove to be the most economical for your trip, as well as the most convenient.
The car is omnipresent in Orlando and is a very easy and convenient (if congested) way to get to your destination. Orlando is a sprawling city with most attractions lying far to the south of downtown and into adjacent cities like Kissimmee and Lake Buena Vista (this section includes those areas). The roads are all wide and easy to drive on with all major attractions well signed, but traffic jams around downtown are common in the afternoons, and around the touristy areas on Friday nights and all day Saturday. Orlando ranks 8th in the nation in terms of traffic congestion, and there are numerous ongoing construction projects on area expressways (all aimed at alleviating this, but only causing congestion in the meanwhile). Traffic information is available from new Dynamic Message Signs, most local radio stations, and also by calling 511 (a free, automated service which provides current traffic info collected from hundreds of traffic cameras as well as police reports.)
The main highway through Orlando, and the only interstate serving it, is Interstate 4 (runs NE-SW). In recent years, major construction on it has widened it through areas south of SR528 making it a commuter-friendly highway (except for traffic during rush hours and Friday and Saturday evenings). Downtown Orlando; International Drive; Amway Arena; the Mall at Millenia; Arabian Nights dinner theater; and theme parks such as Walt Disney World, Universal Studios, Sea World, Discovery Cove, the Holy Land Experience, and Wet n' Wild are all conveniently located along or near I-4.
Aggressive drivers are abundant in the Greater Orlando area not only on major highways but also on surface streets in the downtown district. Speed limits are for the most part ignored in and around the city, even though on I-4 the speed limit is only 50 mph (80 km/h) in the downtown area and ranges between 55 and 65 mph (90-105 km/h) near the attractions, it is not uncommon to be tailgated if you travel less than 80 mph (129 km/h) in the left lane. If you are unfamiliar with the area, it is much easier and safer to drive in the far right lane, as road signs will direct.
<b>Caution:</b> Started in the early 2000s, open road tolling is used along Orlando's toll roads.  A driver with a Sun Pass or E-Pass transponder and a prepaid account continues straight along the road at the speed limit, with the toll accounted for electronically; drivers paying cash (almost all tourists) must follow signage that diverts them to toll booths constructed off the right of the highway. Drivers who do not have transponders and continue going straight past the toll booth are photographed and ticketed.
<br />
Other major highways include toll road SR-528, the Beach Line Expressway although known until recently as the Bee Line, which runs east from I-4 (exit 72) towards the Space Coast beaches and Kennedy Space Center, <a href="/en/Cocoa_Beach" title="Cocoa Beach">Cocoa Beach</a>, and Port Canaveral. SR-528 is, like all Orlando area expressways (<b>not</b> including I-4), a toll road. While tolls are modest for short trips within Orlando, tolls can quickly add on long cross-town trips (bypassing Orlando on SR-417 is $5.50 for 55 mi/89 km. If you're driving from the Disney area to Sanford, FL between 4PM and 6PM, paying the toll is good if you're in a hurry, because it could take you up to 2 hours going on I-4). SR-417 starts at I-4 just west of SR-192/Disney World. It takes you north, passing both the Orlando International Airport and the Orlando-Sanford International Airport. It ends at I-4 in Sanford, FL. SR-408 starts at SR-50 on the East side of Orlando, by the University of Central Florida and takes you past the west side of Orlando to the city of Ocoee, FL. It ends at the Florida Turnpike. SR-429 starts in Apopka, FL at SR-441 and takes you past the Florida Turnpike and Disney World. It ends at I-4, just west of SR-192/Disney World. The Florida Turnpike starts in Miami, FL at I-95 and takes you north through Orlando and ends in Wildwood, FL at I-75. See this convenient toll calculator online: <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.expresswayauthority.com/Corporate/travel/TollCalculator.aspx">[19]</a>.
In Orlando, the main tourism area is International Drive, a strip of road that runs parallel to I-4 for about 10 miles (16 km). Many tourist-focused shops, restaurants, and attractions are to be found along this road; therefore, it is excruciatingly hard to drive on and find parking along this road on weekends, especially in the summer, and excursions to this area are best by bus during such times. Other major roads include: US 192 in Kissimmee (fronted by thousands of small shops and attractions), Orange Blossom Trail (US 92/441...a North-South alternative to I-4), SR-50 (E-W route towards the CBD).
There are a few gas stations that <b>prey on unsuspecting travelers</b> returning rental cars to the airport. This includes Suncoast Energys and Sun Gas on Semoran Blvd. near the airport entrance. Prices at these stations are often more than <b>$2 per gallon above</b> typical market price. <b>Look before you pump!</b> The prices are not posted except on the pump. Plan ahead to have enough time before your flight to drive an extra mile or so up Semoran to the cheaper stations. There also are stations around Disney World that have similar practices.
Orlando is the largest rental car market in the world and is known as capital of car rental companies, with all major car rental companies accessible.  Operating directly within the airport are Alamo, Avis, Budget, Dollar, Enterprise, E-Z Rent-A-Car, L &amp; M Car Rental, National, and Thrifty; courtesy shuttles are available for transport to other rental companies.
There are also several car rental companies located off the Airport in Orlando which you can normally get a better car rental price. Most of these companies are local companies and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.sixt.com">Sixt</a>. 
If you arrive by air via Orlando International Airport and pick up a rental car there, you can go through the north exit and head to SR-528 West to get to International Drive, Universal Orlando and SeaWorld. This will require $1.75 in tolls.  Alternatively, you can take a direct route to Walt Disney World through the south exit to SR-417 South, following it to Exit 5, and taking SR 536 straight into Disney. This requires $2 in tolls. Toll booths along this expressway uses open road tolling: see note above in box.
Orlando's public transportation is the LYNX bus service. Approximately 60 routes serve the metro Orlando area and costs $2 per ride (transfers included) except for the free Lymmo bus service downtown.
*<b>Lymmo Bus</b>, 1-841-LYNX. This free service operates frequently in a circuit in downtown, from City Hall to the Centroplex and back. The Lymmo has a dedicated lane and stations with streetcar type control signals and modified buses that allow passengers to enter the bus without climbing. M-Th 6AM-10PM, F 6AM-midnight, Sa 10AM-midnight, Su 10AM-10PM.
LYNX buses of interest to visitors include routes 8, 42, 50, and 111 -- e.g., bus 8 or 42 for Universal, bus 8 for SeaWorld, and bus 50 or 111 for Disney.  Seven-day standard passes are $16.  Check out GO LYNX <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.golynx.com/">[20]</a>to plan your trips.
*<b>I-Ride Trolley</b>, <i>+1</i> 407-248-9590, <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.iridetrolley.com/">[21]</a>. Along International Drive and Universal Blvd, this trolley primarily serves tourists in the attractions area, operating daily from 8am to 10:30pm.  While the service is advertised as a trolley, the trolleys are in fact modified buses traveling in traffic with many stops, which makes for a slow ride.  There are 85 stops along the main (Red) route on International Drive and 22 stops on the (Green) route that serves less congested Universal Blvd.  The fare is $1.25 per ride for adults, 25Â¢ for seniors, and free to kids younger than 12; exact change is required.  There's an unlimited 1-day pass available for $4 per person.  One-day and multi-day passes, not sold on the bus, are available in many locations.  However, because of the very limited route coverage of I-Ride â- it goes nowhere near Disney -- the better choice for many visitors is to use LYNX buses (e.g., bus 8, 42, 50, or 111).
Orlando is visited by millions of tourists each year and there are dozens of taxi companies that are operational in the region. It will not be a problem to find transportation from The Orlando Airport to your hotel or from the hotel to a theme park, restaurant or mall.  If you are not planning to rent a car, you probably should do some research and arrange your own transportation before arriving to Orlando.

It is advisable to never hail a taxi off the street. Unfortunately some of those companies do not have any license or insurance and operating illegally. These taxi services, although questionable in practice, can be quite convenient. They are generally available at all times of the night to safely transport 'party-goersâ, or those who take advantage of the lively night scene.
There are various shuttles available in and around Orlando. Orlando Airport Van, Mears Transportation, and Supershuttle, among others, provide service 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Rates vary by location, and start as low as $9.99. Many travelers find shuttles a faster and cheaper alternative to their more luxurious counterparts (i.e., taxis, private cars/sedans, etc.). A full list of companies permitted by the City of Orlando and the Aviation Authority you can find on <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.orlandoairports.net/transport/vfh.htm">Orlando International Airport website</a>.
The <b>Go Orlando Card</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://goorlandocard.com">[22]</a> is very useful, and can save significant amounts of money. However, here is so much to do in Orlando that planning a trip itself can become stressful. To alleviate much of this stress, there are ticket packages available for multiple parks, and can not only help plan a trip but save significantly on admission costs. The Orlando FlexTicket <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://theotherorlando.com/contents/chapters/1/flex.html">[23]</a> offers a few different package options that could be critical to your stay.
Although the FlexTicket does not cover any Disney Theme Parks, purchasing these in advance is also not only cost-effective, but can ensure you get everything out of your trip that you are looking for. Using Disney's Website directly <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://disneyparks.disney.go.com/disney-tickets/">[24]</a> allows you to personalize your own vacation. Using the Park Hopper option allows maximum exposure to all Disney Parks.

Orlando is one of the biggest tourist destinations because of the nearby theme parks and resorts. Close to International Drive is <b>Universal Orlando Resort</b>, which includes two theme parks, three hotels and a large shopping district. <b>SeaWorld Orlando</b> is a marine theme park featuring Kraken, the biggest rollercoaster in the Orlando area, as well as Believe, the new Shamu adventure. About 35 minutes southwest of downtown Orlando is <a href="/en/Walt_Disney_World" title="Walt Disney World">Walt Disney World</a>. Comprising four theme parks, two water parks, dozens of hotels, two shopping and dining districts, five golf courses, and much more, it is the largest privately managed tourist destination on the planet. Not far from Disney World lies the Alligator Capital of the World: <b>Gatorland.</b>
Despite the proximity of theme park haven Lake Buena Vista, the city has a lot to offer on its own. Downtown Orlando <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.downtownorlando.com/">[57]</a> is a growing area centered around Orange Avenue that is packed with bars, clubs, and restaurants, as well as theaters and concert venues. The main strip on Orange Avenue is closed most nights because of the large volumes of pedestrians. Just a few blocks over is Lake Eola, a picturesque park situated around a swan-filled lake. In the middle of the lake is a lighted fountain that has been established as an icon of Orlando, and on one side of the lake stands the historic outdoor shell theater, where tourists and locals alike can see a version of the Nutcracker every December. Swan-shaped paddle boats are available for rental as well. Taking over for Church Street as the main night time hot spot is Wall Street. It is a small pedestrian only alley off of Orange Avenue that houses several restaurants and bars. They also have frequent concerts on Wall Street, providing a stage for bands to play for everything from Cinco de Mayo to the Capital One Bowl and Citrus Bowl celebration weeks.

Although Orlando's CityWalk and Downtown Disney's restaurants can be pricey, they also offer the best options for dining, as well as dining and entertainment. In addition, you are afforded the protection of the high police presence in these areas in particular.
Consider visiting one of the culturally and ethnic diverse restaurants located in Disney's Epcot Center. Their Canadian steakhouse is world-famous, and if you are looking for something unique, visiting Morocco is highly advised. Stick around for the nightly fireworks show, starting at 9pm sharp.
In addition, depending on your lodging situation, visiting the Winn Dixie supermarket in Lake Buena Vista can save a lot of dollars. If you have access to a kitchen, get on over there, and do not forget to sign up for a value card at check out for additional savings.
Orlando nightlife away from the theme parks is centered mostly around <b>Central Boulevard</b> and <b>Orange Avenue</b> in downtown Orlando. Here you can walk and find many bars. A short walk away is the tiny <b>Thornton Park District</b>, located near the intersection of Washington and Summerlin. Among the dozens of cafes and pubs, you might stop in for a drink and a quick bite at <b>Dexter's</b> on Washington. For local flair head across the street to <b>Burton's Frosty Mug</b>, or sample the hip urban environment at the trendy <b>HUE</b> at the corner of Washington and Central.
Although most of the downtown Central avenue crowd is comprised of the "twentysomething" generation, for a more 30's and over entertainment experience, one can enjoy live jazz on many nights in the lounge of the <b>Grand Bohemian Hotel</b> located downtown on Orange Avenue. The jazz is excellent and the ambiance is quite comfortable, although drinks tend to be pretty pricey here.
<b>Milk District</b> is a colorful zone about two miles east of Downtown. This area is very bohemian with tons of nightlife, and a teahouse that is 24 hours thursday-sunday.
<b>Winter Park</b> has a more sophisticated nightlife scene centered around Park Avenue, with some students mixed in from prestigious Rollins College down the street. There's also a "food truck stop" that's open 24/7, and Austin's Coffee which is a 24/7 coffeehouse located a bit west of the central area.
Also, for a more professional crowd with a Latin twist, there is the <b>Samba Room</b>, located on Sand Lake Road, about 3/4 west of I-4.  This is a lively restaurant and happy hour type of place. The look is chic and the locals and tourists alike gather here for a quality  food, beverage and people watching experience.  You should ditch the shorts and flip-flops for a more casual chic look, but if you do you will be rewarded with a nice experience here.  If you are traveling west on Sand Lake Road, after passing I-4, The Samba Room is on the left in a large shopping plaza.  Latin food, music and mojitos are just some of the specialties here.
Across the street from the Samba Room, on Sand Lake Road, is the <b>Old Vines wine bar</b>, featuring live jazz usually from Thurs. through Saturday nights.  The wine selection is extensive and the live jazz is some of the best in town. The jazz is performed in the front of the room by the entrance. There is a divider that separates the more intimate rear portion of the establishment, which is the main dining area.
There are quite a few places to enjoy quality dining and drinks along Park Avenue in Winter Park, an adjacent suburb which is just northeast of Orlando.  Winter Park is known for its many older grande homes that dominate the more historic sections of this suburb affectionately referred to by many as the center of Orlando's "old money."  Park Avenue is an active pedestrian street featuring trendy shoppes, galleries, restaurants and nightspots.  It has recently grown from becoming a one street attraction to more of a district, as several nearby streets have now added similar attractions.
Of particular interest and uniqueness on Park Avenue is the <b>Wine Room</b>, a converted bank featuring literally hundreds of wines available for self serve sampling.  The mode of purchasing here is to pre-load a wine "credit card" supplied by the Wine Room.  You are then at liberty to peruse the entire building and select any wine you wish to try, merely by inserting your "credit card." Each wine station automatically deducts the value of your current purchase and advises you of your card balance.  Dress is very casual here and you are likely to meet both locals and visitors, all sampling and enjoying their vinos of choice throughout the night.
At the theme parks,  <b>CityWalk</b> at Universal Studios. For a nominal admission fee, both sites offer numerous venues for libations and entertainment. If you're staying along International Drive, there are plenty of bars, pubs, and clubs.
With a hotel around virtually every corner (actually 4 or 5 around every corner) it seems impossible to throw a rock and not hit a hotel. There are hotels to meet every traveler's need, whether it be a hostel or a 5-star resort, although many visiting families often prefer to rent their own private villa as they usually provide much more personal space and have their own private facilities. There are also a large number of lodgings in the surrounding cities and towns.

In addition to the dozens of hotels on the Disney property, there are a few other luxury hotels and spas in the area:
<b>Extreme Temperatures</b><br />
<i>Never leave children, pets, or the elderly in a parked car for any length of time!</i> Due to high temperature for most of the year, the interior of a parked car can easily heat to <b>lethal</b> temperatures in a short amount of time. During the summer, the interior of a parked car can reach 130-170ÂºF (55-75ÂºC) in just 15 minutes, regardless of the color of the exterior or interior, or whether the windows are open a small amount. You not only risk death, but <b>it is illegal and the consequences are taken VERY seriously,</b> including thousands in fines and even imprisonment.
Like most cities in America, there are certain areas of Orlando which are more dangerous than others. Some areas travelers should be cautious of are:
While it is unlikely that any one individual would experience serious crime in these areas, tourists stand out in these areas, and can unwittingly do things that can make them targets for criminal behavior, so it is sensible to stay away.
While crime in the Orlando area is not particularly high, with the annual tourists far outnumbering the regional population (~2million), a substantial amount of local crime ends up being directed at tourists. The most common crimes are theft of items from cars and hotels, so following common sense travel precautions  are particularly important in an area like Orlando.
While hurricanes attract most of the attention, the proximity to two coasts also brings frequent, and sometimes dangerous, thunderstorms. These occur nearly every day during the rainy season from mid-June through September. While some days it may only rain for 10 minutes, other thunderstorms can last for hours and its not unheard of for one location to remain dry while another spot 10 miles away gets a couple inches of rain on an afternoon. The summer thunderstorms are the main reason that Florida is the lightning capital of the western hemisphere. During these storms it is best to remain indoors due to the danger posed by frequent cloud-to-ground lightning. Golfers are especially vulnerable. A couple of dozen people are killed each year by lightning in Florida and many more spend much time receiving treatment for lightning strikes.
Pets are better off left with a friend or in a kennel. If you choose to bring your pet, note that most theme parks and hotels prohibit pets but may provide kennels for a fee. Also note above about interior temperatures in parked cars.
For truly the safest experience, consider staying on Disney-owned property. If this is not possible, the area of Lake Buena Vista would be a preferred location. In addition to its accessibility to attractions, it offers a much safer, less urbanized area for comfort.
<a href="/en/Walt_Disney_World" title="Walt Disney World">Walt Disney World</a>, about 35 minutes southwest of Orlando proper, is so expansive that it needs its own travel guide.
