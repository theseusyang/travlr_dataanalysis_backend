<b>Suzhou</b> (èå·; <i>SÅ«zhÅu</i>)  <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.suzhou.gov.cn/English/">[1]</a> is a city in <a href="/en/Jiangsu" title="Jiangsu">Jiangsu</a> province. It is famed for its beautiful gardens and traditional waterside architecture. The Classical Gardens of Suzhou were inscribed on the <a href="/en/UNESCO_World_Heritage_List" title="UNESCO World Heritage List">UNESCO World Heritage List</a> in 1997.
Suzhou was the capital of the kingdom of Wu from the 12th to 4th centuries BC. Historically, it was the center of Wu culture, and the Suzhou dialect of the <a href="/en/Wu_phrasebook" title="Wu phrasebook">Wu language</a> is still considered the standard dialect even though the language is now often called "Shanghainese".
Today, Suzhou has become a core city of China's Yangtze River Delta economic zone, given its high GDP contribution to China. More recently, it has been a center of the silk trade and a place of gardens and canals. Suzhou has long been a heaven for scholars, artists, and skilled craftsmen, and this is still the case today.
In its many beautiful gardens and courtyard parks, Suzhou's ancient heritage has been preserved. This ambitious city, however, is not going to trade upon its past in order to meet the future. A wander off the beaten path and into some of the old neighborhoods can be quite a treat, but their seediness and crowded conditions provide a stark contrast to the endless billboards at the edge of the city advertising Orange County like suburban developments. Suzhou is a bustling city, though you can still see traces of a very old lifestyle centered around the canals.
So come prepared to feel a bit betrayed by the guidebooks singing the praises of a quaint thousand year old city. On XiBei Road thoroughfare, every other storefront advertised foot massages. It seems that half the city are masseur/masseuses and the other half are potential clients.
At the same time, Suzhou has grown into a major center of joint-venture high-tech manufacturing and currently boasts one of the hottest economies in the world. It is the world's largest single producer of laptop computers. The Suzhou Industrial Park (SIP) in the east, and the Suzhou New District (SND) in the west, are home to factories from numerous North American, European, East Asian, and Australian companies. Major industrial products include microchips, flash memory systems, electronics, computer equipment, telecommunications components, power tools, speciality chemicals and materials, automotive components, pharmaceuticals, and much more. This makes for a sense of stark contrasts, the outskirts of town were farmland just ten years ago. Now there are four lane highways connecting the city to Shanghai...four lane highways with pedestrians, bicyclists and pedicabs using the breakdown lanes.
Suzhou doesn't have a passenger airport. The closest airports with flights of use to most travelers are in <a href="/en/Shanghai" title="Shanghai">Shanghai</a>. There is one in <a href="/en/Wuxi" title="Wuxi">Wuxi</a> which is closer, but it serves mostly domestic flights. <a href="/en/Nanjing" title="Nanjing">Nanjing</a> and Hangzhou are also an alternative.
<b>Pudong International Airport</b> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IATA" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:IATA">IATA</a>: <b>PVG</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICAO" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:ICAO">ICAO</a>: <b>ZSPD</b>) has most international flights and <b>Hongqiao Airport</b> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IATA" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:IATA">IATA</a>: <b>SHA</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICAO" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:ICAO">ICAO</a>: <b>ZSSS</b>) has mostly domestic flights. They are 120 km (75 mi) and 86 km (53 mi) away from Suzhou respectively but regular Shuttle buses run between Suzhou and the airports daily, taking about one hour and forty minutes to get you where you want to go.
<b>Shuttle bus services between Suzhou and Shanghai Airports</b>
A shuttle bus between Pudong and Hongqiao leaves every 10 minutes from 6AM-9PM and costs Â¥30
Intercity Bus between Suzhou and Hangzhou airports. You can go to Waiting Room,the location is North of Entrance 5 to the Arrival Hall, First Level of Terminal Building. Price range is CNY20/per~CNY30per.
Wuxi Airport is situated to the southeast of Wuxi and has several domestic and few international flights (e.g. to Taiwan)
From airport to Wuxi city center (Wuxi train station) there are infrequent (every 30 minutes) buses, just on the right side when you exit the airport (see blue plate with chinese characters and timetable for 1,2,3 routes). Allow at least 40 minutes to ride to Wuxi center and about 15 minutes for a ride between Wuxi and Suzhou on a high-speed train.
There are four major train stations in Suzhou: Suzhou Station (Suzhou Zhan), Suzhou North Station (Suzhou Bei Zhan), Suzhou Industrial Park Station (Suzhou Yuanqu), and Suzhou Xinqu Station.
If you live in SIP it's more convinient to use Suzhou Yuanqu station (note some trains stop on that one instead of Suzhou Station)
Suzhou North Railway station (èå·åç«, SÅ«zhÅu bÄi zhÃ n) is used for high-speed trains departing to/from Beijing. It's situated a bit outskirts. A ride to Beijing usually takes 5 hours.
Suzhou Station (èå·ç«è½¦ç«, SÅ«zhÅu huÇchÄ zhÃ n) is located just north of the downtown on the northern ring-road (Beihuan Lu) and is on the Shanghai-Nanjing mainline. There are frequent high-speed trains to Shanghai, Wuxi, Changzhou, Zhenjiang and Nanjing. A train ride to Shanghai takes less than half an hour and Nanjing is about one hour away.
The slower and lower class T- and K- services from other provinces on their way to Shanghai or Nanjing stop at Suzhou, but if you are traveling from anywhere within Jiangsu you're advised to take a fast G-train.
Buying tickets for G- and D-trains using self-service machines is not possible for people without chinese ID card since June 2011 - only using ticket office. All other tickets can be bought at the counter at the railway station or at railway ticket offices throughout the city. For services other than the high-speed trains, it's wise to book outbound tickets a few days in advance as they fill up quickly, especially during public holidays. If you have a Chinese bank account, it is possible to book a ticket at the railways' official 12306.cn, it is in Chinese only and only accept UnionPay payment. The official 12306.cn doesn't charge any fees.
Ticket Offices in the city: 8 Taijian Alley Guanqian Jie (è§åè¡ï¼, 566 Renmin Lu ï¼äººæ°è·¯ï¼, 50 Jinmen Lu ï¼éé¨è·¯ï¼, 22 Beiju Lu, 18 Shi Lu ï¼ç³è·¯ï¼, 120 Sanxiang Lu ï¼ä¸é¦è·¯ï¼ and Xiangwang Lu ï¼ç¸çè·¯ï¼ (Near the east end of Shi Quan Jie ï¼åå¨è¡ï¼)
<b>From the Suzhou Railway Station into town</b>
The new train station is exceptional and has metered taxis only and bus services well set out.  Buses mostly services will head towards the Guanqian Street/Ganjiang Lu area of downtown (15-20 minutes), although it's advisable to check. Buses 6, 26, 29, 178 will go to the SIP. It is possible to buy a tourist map (English-Chinese, Â¥10) indicating the bus routes in one of the tourism offices on the lefthand side of the walkway leading up to the North exit. Once outside the station, the bus stops can be found on the righthand side. Bus You1 and You4 (both heading towards Renmin Lu) leave from platform 4.  On foot, it takes about 20-30 minutes to walk to most of the sights - simply go outside the station and head right. At the first intersection, make an immediate right into either one of two tunnels heading under the train tracks. A pedestrian path is available that will take you to the old part of town. Once you cross the river, the 8-story pagoda called Beisi Ta should be in plain sight. In summer, it might not be very convenient to walk downtown as temperatures might easily get up to 40 degrees.
If you are adventurous you can try to unofficial e-bike taxi - guys standing right to the station outside, you can negotiate to about &#165;20 to city center.
Suzhou has 3 main bus stations
The China Eastern Airlines City Air Terminal on the intersection of Renmin Lu and Ganjiang Xilu also has a small terminal for shuttle buses to Shanghai Hongqiao and Pudong airports, see Get In/Air for details.
If you are feeling adventurous, it is possible to cycle from Shanghai to Suzhou in 2-3 hours (70km). From Shanghai city centre, head west towards Hongqiao Airport (following the route of Metro line 2) and follow the S343 Provincial Highway. This road can be quite busy but there's a segregated cycle path along it's entire length and the route is entirely flat. The road passes through the attractive water town of Luzhi (20km east of Suzhou) making a nice stopping off point and the road will bring you into the Suzhou Industrial Park and ends at Donghuan Lu (the east part of the inner ring road).
The overnight ferries between Hangzhou and Suzhou are no longer running.
Riverboats on the Yangtze stop at Suzhou. See <a href="/en/Along_the_Yangtze_river" title="Along the Yangtze river" class="mw-redirect">Along the Yangtze river</a>.
Downtown Suzhou (Canglang, Pingjiang and part of Jinchang district) is completely bounded by a large, rectangular canal known as the Weichang River (Weichang HÃ©), with 9 east-west canals and 12 north-south canals running through the city. Most of the major sights are located within this area. Slightly further out is the ring road which is divided into east (Donghuan Lu), west (Xihuan Lu), north-east (Beihuan Dong Lu), north-west (Beihuan Xi Lu), south-east (Nanhuan Dong Lu) and south-west (Nanhuan Xi Lu) sections. The main long-distance transport hubs are located along this road, and bus #10 runs in a complete loop of the ring road. The two main cross-town avenues are Renmin Lu (north-south) and Ganjiang Lu (east-west). Outside of the ring road, Jinjihu Lake marks the centre of the SIP with 2 main through roads crossing the lake (Xiandai Avenue to the north and Jinjihu Avenue to the south). Most streets in the SIP have names beginning with Xing (Star) for east-west routes and Su (Suzhou) for north-south routes.
It's possible to walk around the city although many will find the distances between some attractions too large to make walking an option. Ask the concierge at your hotel to write out the name of your destination(s), as well as how to get back. Make sure to add your own notes so you know what the translation is. Be warned that walking in downtown is by no means relaxing - most sidewalks are narrow and clogged with parked scooters meaning that you'll end up walking in the bike lane or in the road. Also, around the subway construction sites the sidewalk and bike lane disappear altogether. Keep your eyes and ears open. Walking in the SIP is more pleasant as roads and sidewalks are wider, and traffic is less heavy.
Suzhou's fleet of 4,000 rattling old silver-and-teal VW Santana taxis are a very reasonably priced way of getting around - if you can find one that is. During the week taxis are easily available, but from Friday afternoon until Sunday night it is nearly impossible to find free car in historic center of town. Fares start at Â¥12 for 3 km and tick up at Â¥2.8 per km, so most trips within the city are cheap. That said, Suzhou's cabbies are infamous for their lack of local knowledge so having an address or phone contact to your destination will save you a lot of hassle. Driving style is best described as aggressive, although serious accidents involving taxis are rare. Be warned of taxi touts near tourist destinations and the train station - always use the taxi queue or flag one down from the street (available taxis have a green light on the front dash). Always get a receipt from the taxi driver at the end of the ride, so you may call the taxi company if you have left anything behind or need to dispute a fare.
Few, if any taxi drivers speak English or any other foreign languages, so unless you speak the local Suzhou dialect or Mandarin, be sure to get your hotel's business card, and have the names and addresses of your destinations written in Chinese to show your taxi driver.
Cycling is an interesting but sometimes hair-raising way of exploring Suzhou. That said, cycling is much safer here than in, say London or New York, as Suzhou has an excellent network of cycle paths running alongside most major roads, however these also double up as scooter paths, sidewalks and parking lots; and some are rather potholed, so it's advisable to stay alert.
Bikes can be rented from most youth hostels or small bike shops (around 30 yuan per day for a slow, heavy 1-speed city bike) or from the Bicycle Kingdom rental agency on Pingjiang Lu (they have road bikes and mountain bikes to rent for around 150-300 yuan per day depending on the model).
If you are planning on cycle-touring in China, Suzhou is a good place to start out. Several major cycle manufacturors including Giant, Merida, Dahon, UCC, bTwin and Shimano have factories in nearby Kunshan (a small industrial town which falls under Suzhou's municipal administration), which has given Suzhou a lively cycling culture. The following bicycle stores are recommended:-
<b>Giant</b> (1607 Renmin Lu, Pingjiang-qu)
The largest store of the Taiwanese aptly-named giant - offers everything from single-speed city-bikes to full-suspension mountain bikes; and electric scooters to ultra-aerodynamic triathlon road bikes. Giant is somewhat cheaper than in the west, making them a popular choice. A simple city-bike will cost around &#165;500, mountain bikes run from around &#165;800 (for a steel-frame, no suspension with old components. &#165;2,000 will get you an entry-level road bike, a decent hard-tail MTB, a hybrid or a basic tourer. Staff don't speak much English.
<b>Decathlon</b> (Auchan Shopping Mall 1F, 55 Jinjihu Lu, SIP)
The French sports-hypermarket has a branch on the 1F of the Auchan Supermarket in SIP. Price-wise they are similar to Giant although quality of components is not so great. Staff speak a little English.
<b>Silver Storm</b> (city branch on Shizi Jie, Canglang-qu; SIP Branch on Xinggui Jie, SIP)
Silver Storm is one of the best places to buy components and accessories, and also the only place who will completely custom-build you a bike. They stock several regular brands including UCC, Orbea and Dahon, although they will order almost any brand for you. Prices are fairly reasonable and there is always an interesting variety of bikes on sale. The staff speak good English.
<b>Specialized</b> (Harmony Plaza, Ganjiang Dong Lu, Pingjiang-qu)
By far the most expensive but also the best bike shop in Suzhou. If you want a top-end road or mountain bike, or the latest Shimano components, this is the place to come. Prices are approx. 20% higher than in the West.
<b>Trek</b> (Xincheng Dasha, Xiandai Dadao, SIP)
The 'other' top American brand has a small store in the New City community shopping center (behind the Starbucks) offering more top-end bikes. Prices are more reasonable for a top-end brand and the service is very good. As the store is very small, they only carry a small stock - if you are buying a whole bike, most likely the store will need to order it.
Most hypermarkets also stock bikes, typically cheap but low-quality. Expect to pay 200-300 yuan for a 1-speed city bike that will fall apart after 2 weeks.
Remember to always keep your bike locked when not in use - bike theft is a major problem, particularly in downtown. Always leave your bike somewhere brightly lit and crowded. In some places (particularly around Guanqian Jie), attendants will keep an eye on your bike for a small payment (typically Y0.50).
Available on most main streets and always near tourist attractions. <b>Negotiate the price before</b> you get in and don't allow the driver to change it once you arrive at your destination, for example, saying Â¥15 and demanding Â¥50. This is a slow means of travel but it allows you to actually see the city while you go somewhere. Despite what you might expect, pedicabs are often more expensive than taxis- and be warned that 99% of Suzhou pedicab drivers are notorious price-gougers, so bargain hard with these guys. Expect to pay a little more in the summer months since the driver is working hard in the heat to take you there.
Found the same places as pedicabs, and should be approached with similar caution. Suzhou motorcycle taxis are usually filthy, dangerously driven, and relentlessly uncomfortable (the seats are about 12 cm above the floor) so traumatic to your spine it would be best to consider another form of transport.
Taking a bus in Suzhou is relatively easy if you have a basic grasp of Chinese, or horribly bewildering if you don't. Though, fortunately, there are tourist routes which make this slightly easier. Buses cover the whole city, run at 10-20 minute frequencies from 5am-9pm on most routes and are a cheap way of getting around. Unfortunately all bus information boards and on-board announcements are in Chinese only, however bus route information can also be found on Google Maps.
Fares are based upon the distance between where you board and the last stop of the bus - most times you will pay Â¥1 or Â¥2, although some longer routes such as the #69 to Xishan charge up to 5 yuan - the fare will be displayed on the bus schedule as well as on a digital display above the driver's seat (don't get this confused with the route number!). Exact change is required, so keep plenty of Â¥1 coins/notes handy. Buses displaying a green or blue 'snow-flake' symbol next to the route number have air-conditioning and a Â¥1 surcharge is paid on top of the regular fare (regardless of whether the A/C is switched on or not).
There are 5 handy tourist buses numbered Y1-5 - all serve the railway station and connect most of the tourist sights within the city proper, so if you are unfamiliar with the city, they are a good way to familiarize yourself. <b>Warning for people unable to read Chinese -</b> as of September 2012, the tourist buses are prefixed with the Chinese character for "tour" <b>æ¸¸</b> rather than "Y". Bus æ¸¸1 leaves from bus platform 4 of the Suzhou Train Station, and the station is the last stop of its return journey.
Buses are often crowded, and it's good custom to offer your seat to elderly, disabled or mothers with children.
If you are in town for a while, it's advisable to get a Suzhou-Tong card (available from several outlets around town) - it's a prepaid smart-card that gives you 10% discount on bus travel.
The Suzhou Metro opened on May 1st 2012. There is as of May 2013, 1 functioning line which runs east-west linking the Suzhou New District, the Old Town and the Suzhou Industrial Park. A second line is under construction and will run north-south linking the new Suzhou High Speed Railway station in the north, across the Old Town and into the southern suburbs. A mock-up of the new Suzhou Metro train car is on display in the Times Square (shi dai guang chang) shopping area in the Suzhou Industrial Park.
The local Suzhou dialect belongs to the <b>Wu</b> family of Chinese dialects, and is not mutually intelligible with standard Mandarin. As Suzhou is the traditional cradle of Wu culture, the Suzhou dialect is taken to be the prestige dialect of Wu Chinese. As such, Suzhou is the place to start for people who want to learn to speak Wu Chinese. However, as with elsewhere in China, most people are bilingual in the local dialect and <a href="/en/Chinese_phrasebook" title="Chinese phrasebook">Mandarin</a>, and you should have no problem speaking Mandarin unless you are talking to the elderly.
English is not widely spoken, though staff at major hotels will likely be able to speak some basic English. Be sure to have the names of your destinations written in Chinese, so that taxi drivers can take you to where you want to go.

<b>BYOB Weekend cycle rides</b>
Rides to nearby attractions such as Tai Lake (30km one way), Yangcheng Lake (40km around the lake), Tongli (20km one way) and Zhouzhuang (40km one way), there are a couple of unofficial cycle clubs run by local cycle shops who run 1 and 2 day rides off the beaten path. Pace is normally relaxed with regular stops for photos and taking a rest. Joining the tour is free, although you have to bring your own bike (BYOB), although you may be able to rent a bike from the store for a deposit and small charge - costs such as meals and accommodation is split between group members. Although most of the riders are locals, foreigners are always welcomed and most members will speak English, and will ride in a safe manner. The following places will have regular rides for most of the year&#160;:-
If you consider buying arts and craft items, teas, silks, or other items that are somewhat costly, it would be advantageous to get the help of a Chinese-speaking person, preferably a Suzhou local who knows the products and markets. Many more upscale hotels will offer the services of a personal assistant, or you can try asking around in one of the local expat hangouts to get connected to a friendly local person with some free time. Informed Chinese assistance can make a <i>huge</i> difference in the price and quality of the things you buy. As with anywhere in China, bargaining is the norm.
As a city famed through the ages for its silk embroidery, Suzhou is one of the best places to pick up <b>silk handicrafts</b>.  Shopping is good along Shi Quan St, especially for many souvenirs. The Silk Embroidery Institute is a lively enterprise producing high quality work which you can see on a tour of the facility. The gift shop has prices a little higher than at the street stalls but they will bargain and the quality is much better.
<b>Suzhou embroidery</b>, <b>silk fans</b>, <b>musical instruments</b>, <b>scroll mounting</b>, <b>lanterns</b>, <b>mahogany furniture</b> and <b>jade carving</b> are available at discount prices since they are made or created within the city. Suzhou double-sided embroidery, in which the same picture is rendered in great detail on both sides of a silk screen and the knots are tied in the middle, is a traditional Suzhou speciality and is absolutely amazing. The needles used for this work are finer than a human hair. Be aware that the lower-priced examples of Suzhou embroidery sold to many tourists are probably made by machines.
<b>Freshwater pearls</b> &#8211; The Suzhou area is part of the largest freshwater pearl-producing region in the world. Pearls can be bought in every conceivable price and quality range, either singly or as strings or jewellery.
<b>Sandalwood fans</b> &#8211; folding fans made from thin ornately-stamped sheets of sandalwood- are another very old Suzhou craft and widely sold around the city. The scent of the breeze they generate while fanning is heavenly. Cheap versions are probably more mundane wood dipped in sandalwood oil, and will lose their scent rather quickly.
<b>Tea</b> is produced in Suzhou; the most famous locally-produced green tea is called 'Biluochun'. Large shops with endless varieties of tea can be found all around the city, and some have seating where you will be encouraged to come sit and sample a pot.
<b>Snuff bottles</b> are a long-standing Suzhou craft that remains popular today. Tiny glass bottles are delicately painted <i>on the inside</i> with elaborate and beautiful pictures. The best ones are truly incredible works of art.
Suzhou has its own unique, slightly sweet cuisine that tends to have very light and delicate flavors. Locals are very fond of freshwater fish and shellfish. <b>Sweets</b> made from glutinous rice paste are an old tradition here; these will generally baffle most Western palates. A Suzhou specialty popular with many visitors is <b>Song Shu Gui Yu</b>, often rendered in English something like "Squirrel-Shaped Mandarin Fish": the meat of a large fish is delicately cut into strips, breaded in flour, fried, and served covered with pine nuts and a sweet-and-sour sauce. It looks a little like a squirrel's tail...if you've drunk enough of the local rice wine.
<br />
<br />
<b>Shiquan Street</b> (åå¨è¡)is the main bar area. It is also the entertainment district for guys looking for a little conversation with gals. A number of the bars on this street are thinly-veiled fronts for the world's oldest profession; numbers of very friendly young ladies sitting around the bar or standing in doorways to tempt in passers-by are easily recognized. Those wishing to avail themselves of such diversions are encouraged to exercise extreme caution, not overdo the drinking, ask the cost of everything (including the room you are taken to) before accepting it, and never pay anything in advance. 
Some of the better known ones (safer?) are "The Moon Bar" aka 'The Danish Embassy", known for its regular crowd of locals, The Blue Lady Bar and The Red Lion Bar - all within the block between FengHuangJie and Suzhou Hotel. All offer drinks without other services and they won't bother you if you are not partaking further!
Suzhou is a safe place on the whole but there are a few things to watch out for. Pickpocketing is common on crowded buses around the north bus station and the train station.  Pan-handlers and beggars around the old town can become a real nuisance although they are not dangerous.  Watch out for incredibly pushy hawkers operating on Guanqian Jie shopping street - they generally charge ridiculous prices for counterfeit goods.
Taxis are generally safe although it's advisable not to follow touts operating around tourist sights or the train station. Also be aware that pedicab and 3-wheel tuk-tuk drivers are known to overcharge.
Probably the biggest safety risk in Suzhou are the <b>electric scooters</b>. These cheap, plastic, battery powered 2-wheel vehicles swarm around the city like ninjas and are renowned for driving anywhere possible - the wrong side of the road, the pavement, tiny alleyways and across crowded pedestrian crossings. They are almost silent and riders generally don't use headlights at night to save battery power - the only giveaway is their squeaky electric horns. Don't be surprised when you're walking down a busy pavement and one of these pocket-rockets whizzes past at 50 km/h without warning so always keep an eye and an ear out for them, particularly at night and at rush hour when the designated bike lanes become too crowded so the riders take alternate means.
Remember that in China it's LEGAL for car drivers to make a right turn against a red light - albeit they ignore the latter part of the rule 'turn with caution' - it's all too common for cars, and more notoriously, trucks, to fly round an intersection too fast and unfortunately accidents involving pedestrians, cyclists and motorcyclists are too common. Always keep an eye out in both directions when crossing the street.
Some travelers may need to heed the air quality in Suzhou, although the problem is not as bad as in Shanghai or Nanjing, for example.
Like in most of China, tap water is not safe for drinking, but ok for washing and cleaning teeth, and safe if boiled.
As Suzhou is a water-town, there is a high presence of mosquitoes in the summer - luckily repellant can be found in every convenience store and they don't carry any known diseases so they're more of an annoyance than a hazard.
Suzhou has many free WiFi access points as well as pay (&#165;2.5 per hour) Internet cafes.
The biggest concentration of Internet Cafes are located along Moye Road just east of Shiquan Street. Most are about &#165;2.50 per hour and have fast internet, headphones, webcam etc and also serve hot and cold drinks, and cigarettes (smoking is permitted inside). Note that Chinese customers will use their ID card to access the computer - foreigners should either bring their passport to register onto the computer, although if this facility is not provided the cashier will use his/her card to sign you in, although police will occasionally check in which case it may be harder for you to use.
