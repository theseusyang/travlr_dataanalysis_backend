<b>Dubai</b> (<b>Ø¯Ø¨Ù</b>) is one of the seven emirates that make up the <a href="/en/United_Arab_Emirates" title="United Arab Emirates">United Arab Emirates</a>. It is rather like an independent city-state and is the most modern and progressive emirate in the UAE, developing at an unbelievable pace in the tourist and trade sectors especially.
A relatively new tourist destination, Dubai was gaining popularity in recent years until the global economic crash of 2008. 
Dubai is essentially a desert city with superb infrastructure, liberal policies (by regional standards), that became popular for its excellent tourist amenities. Just 5 h from <a href="/en/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a> and 3 h from most parts of the Middle East, the Near East, and the subcontinent of India, Dubai makes a great short break for shopping, partying, sunbathing, fine dining, sporting events, and even a few sinful pleasures. It is a city of superlatives: for the fastest, biggest, tallest, largest and highest, Dubai is the destination. It has the largest immigrant population in the world. 
The weekly day off is on Friday. Note that, since September 2006, a harmonised weekend of Friday and Saturday has been adopted for the public sector and schools. Government departments, multinational companies, and most schools and universities are now off on Friday and Saturday (after years of a mixed bag of Friday/Saturday and Thursday/Friday weekends). Some local companies still work half a day on Thursday with a full day on Saturday, but larger companies tend to permit relaxation and time off work for their employees on Friday and Saturday.
<b>One Emirates, many Peoples</b><br />
Once you land in Dubai, you might not think it is an Arab country. You might think that you are in <a href="/en/India" title="India">India</a> or the <a href="/en/Philippines" title="Philippines">Philippines</a>. Indians are known as the fathers of development of Dubai. When Dubai was in poor state before the exploration of oil, Indians supplied technology to develop Dubai. Dubai, since the founding of the oil industry, has attracted thousands of migrants from all over the world notably from <a href="/en/Pakistan" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>, <a href="/en/India" title="India">India</a>, <a href="/en/Bangladesh" title="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a>,  and the <a href="/en/Philippines" title="Philippines">Philippines</a> in search of jobs. In this modern day, Indians and Filipinos have left their influence in the emirate: Indian restaurants and Pakistani bakeshops are everywhere while Filipino supermarkets are on the rise. Next to them the Europeans (mostly British and French) and Sri Lankans, form the next largest communities.  Chinese and Indonesian migrants are on the rise. Many Arab countries have passed policies like the UAE's <i>Emiratisation</i>, which is a policy that prevents migrants from taking <i>all</i> the job opportunities and provides more jobs to local Emiratis.
Dubai is divided into multiple districts or municipalities:
Dubai has an arid climate with very hot, humid summer weather averaging 42 degrees (108F) in the daytime and 28 (84F) at night. Falls and Springs are still rather hot, with daytime temperatures between 25 and 40 degrees (80sF) and nights around 20 degrees (65-75F), with less humidity. Winter weather is pleasant and dry, with daytime highs of 25 (75F) and nighttime lows of 10 degrees (55F). Dubai is known for its beaches, with water temperature in summer getting as hot as 37 degrees (99F). The water temperature tends to be around 20-25 degrees (75F) in winter, and 30 (85F) in spring and fall as outside temperatures rise.
December to April generally produces the highest precipitation, which at 10 cm (5 in), still is little. Some years yield no more than a few minutes of shower in Dubai. November 2006 brought record rains up to 50 cm (25 in) of rain, with temperatures at record lows.
See <a href="/en/United_Arab_Emirates#Get_in" title="United Arab Emirates">Get in section</a> of the UAE page for visa and customs regulations.  While Israeli passport holders are not welcome, having Israeli stamps in your passport is not a problem.
If you are traveling from India and are of a nationality for which an advance visa is required, it might be necessary to get an 'Ok to Board' stamp on your tickets and Visa. This is generally arranged by a travel agent. If this has not been done, consult your airline office once you have a visa and airline ticket in your possession.
Dubai's main airport is the Dubai International Airport.  You can also enter Dubai by using Sharjah International Airport (SHJ) in the nearby emirate of <a href="/en/Sharjah" title="Sharjah">Sharjah</a> and Abu Dhabi International Airport (AUH) in nearby <a href="/en/Abu_Dhabi" title="Abu Dhabi">Abu Dhabi</a>. Frequent visitors from countries granted automatic visa on entry may wish to purchase an e-gate card to speed up immigration formalities and save passport pages.  The e-gate card office is situated in the upstairs foodcourt area of the terminal 1 departures concourse.  The card will cost AED 200.  Note: If you intend to buy an e-gate card in Dubai, you must have entered UAE via Dubai airport.
Airlines are often having price wars to glamorous destinations like Dubai and this can work to your advantage by careful planning and comparison of the various airlines serving Dubai. Emirates<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.emirates.com">[1]</a> is Dubai's official airline carrier which connects Dubai to over 100 destinations while FlyDubai<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.flydubai.com">[2]</a> is Dubai's low-cost carrier. Etihad<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.etihadairways.com">[3]</a> has shuttle services from their exclusive check in facility in Sheikh Zayed Rd or Central Business District of Dubai to and from Abu Dhabi Int'l Airport, you can also fly with Sharjah's low-cost carrier; Air Arabia<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.airarabia.com">[4]</a> which flies to over 46 destinations within the Middle East.
<b>Dubai International Airport</b> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IATA" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:IATA">IATA</a>: <b>DXB</b>) <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.dubaiairport.com/diainternet/">[5]</a> is the largest hub in the Middle East and the home base of Dubai's flag carrier Emirates <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.emirates.com/english">[6]</a> and its low-cost wing FlyDubai <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.flydubai.com/">[7]</a>.  In fact, it has grown at such a furious pace that the present terminals are bursting at the seams, especially during the peak hours around midnight.
The Dubai International Airport has three terminals and another one in the making as of end 2010.
Terminals 1 and 3 are directly connected to each other via the airside (no immigration needed for transfer), while Terminal 2 is located at the other end of the airport. Terminals 1 and 3 are models of modern airport design, but Terminal 2, despite the recent renovations, is still reminiscent of developing world airports, with long check-in lines, queue-jumping and every other passenger checking in 70 kg of luggage. Shuttle buses between the three run every 20-30 min. However shuttles to Terminal 2 are sporadic at best, so a 30 min taxi ride may be your only option. A low-cost option for traveling to Terminal 2 is to catch the metro to a nearby station, such as GGICO metro station, and from there catch a taxi to Terminal 2.
The airport is famous for its duty-free shopping <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.dubaidutyfree.com">[8]</a>. However, prices in the airport's duty-free stores are equal or higher than what you can find in the many malls of the city. Alcohol here is very cheap, though. Alcohol is also available at an inbound duty free store situated in the baggage reclaim area. The amount of alcoholic beverages and beers should not exceed 4 liters of alcohol beverages, or 2 cartons of beer (each consisting of 24 cans, not exceeding 355 ml for each can or its equivalent).
<b>Taxi</b>: Most visitors will opt for public taxis from the airport, which are readily available just outside arrivals, which use the meter and start at Dhs 25. Taxis are on the left when you come out of terminal 1.
<b>Public transport</b>: Terminals 1 and 3 are served by the Dubai Metro.  There are also buses just steps from the baggage claim, the most useful for visitors being lines 401 and 402 (Dhs 3), which go to the Al Sabkha and Al Ghubaiba bus terminals respectively.
Apart from the Dubai International Airport, Dubai is also developing the massive Al Maktoum International Airport located close to Jabel Ali within the Dubai World Central project. As of end 2010 only a few freighters are operating through this airport but commercial flights are expected to operate from this airport once completed, making this airport one of the busiest air hub for both cargo and passenger transportation.
<b>Sharjah International Airport</b> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IATA" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:IATA">IATA</a>: <b>SHJ</b>) <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.shj-airport.gov.ae/">[9]</a>is located in the emirate of <a href="/en/Sharjah" title="Sharjah">Sharjah</a>. It is only 30 min by road from Dubai and takes an increasing number of international flights as Dubai airport struggles to keep up with demand. Be aware that during morning rush hour from Sharjah and afternoon rush hour into Sharjah, travel times to cross the border between the two emirates normally run more than one hour and can run over two hours. Traffic can be bad between Sharjah and Dubai 24 hours per day, so plan accordingly. The principal carrier here is Air Arabia <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.airarabia.com/">[10]</a>, a low-cost carrier serving the Middle East and South Asia. The airport is fairly basic but is being expanded. A taxi ride to Dubai will typically cost Dhs 50. A Bus service by Air Arabia also runs from the Airport to the Rashidiya Metro Station in Dubai. Rashidiya metro station is located close to the Dubai International Airport.
Dubai's only international road border is with <a href="/en/Oman" title="Oman">Oman</a> at Al Wajajah.  Expatriate residents of Oman will require an official permit to exit Oman by road.  Visitors do not require the permit.  There is an OMR 3.000 charge per vehicle to exit Oman and, if returning, retain the charge receipt as it will be required to reenter.  Ensure that insurance is valid for the UAE (preferably before commencing the journey).  Temporary UAE insurance can be purchased at the border for a premium price.
There are also road borders between the neighbouring Emirate of <a href="/en/Abu_Dhabi" title="Abu Dhabi">Abu Dhabi</a> and Oman at the Al Burami Oasis which divides the sister cites of Al Ain and Al Burami, Oman.
The Government of Dubai operates a network of buses linking Dubai city with the capitals of the other six emirates of the UAE. The buses run under the name <b>Emirates Express</b> and operate from various bus terminals in Dubai.
For timetables see the website <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.rta.ae/wpsv5/wps/portal/bus_time_table?SwitchToLatestLocale=true">[11]</a>.
Dubai is a trading hub for dhows from around the Indian Ocean. Travellers wanting to arrive in the city this way will probably need to make their own arrangements with the captain of the vessel.
Dubai has an international cruise terminal <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.definitelydubai.com/im-visiting/getting-there/-sea/dubai-cruise-terminal">[12]</a> at Port Rashid. During wintertime Costa Cruises has based one of its cruise ships (Costa Luminosa) at Dubai.
A boat service by Valfajre Shipping Company <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.valfajr.ir">[13]</a> leaves <a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Bandar_Lengeh&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Bandar Lengeh (page does not exist)">Bandar Lengeh</a> on Sundays and Tuesdays at 6:00pm, docking at Port Rashid in Dubai. Crossing the Persian Gulf takes roughly 6 hours, and a two way first class ticket costs as of February 2010 US$145 (IR 1,450,000) and also two way economy class ticket costs US$122 (IR 1,220,000).
Especially after the launch of the metro, Dubai's public transport system is probably the best in the Middle East, but it's still a very car-oriented city and most visitors end up taking taxis quite often.  The <b>Wojhati</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://wojhati.rta.ae/">[14]</a> journey planner can suggest the best way to travel.
A day pass valid for unlimited rides on the metro and buses costs Dh14, while the <b>Nol Silver</b> stored-value card costs Dh20 (including Dh14 worth of balance) and gives a 10% discount on both metro and bus fares.  Both are available at metro stations and major bus stations. The Silver card is useful for public transport users who stay in Dubai for more than a day.
Dubai's 52-km long <b>Red Line</b>, opened in September 2009, is the third metro in the Arab world after <a href="/en/Cairo" title="Cairo">Cairo</a> and <a href="/en/Algiers" title="Algiers">Algiers</a>.  As of May 15, 2010, 21 stations are open and the rest are scheduled to open by the end of the year.  While the line does not serve the old city center, it's handy for zipping along Dubai's long coastline and includes stops at the airport, Burj Khalifa and the Mall of the Emirates.  The <b>Green Line</b>, which burrows through the city core, has been open as of September 9, 2011. A further two stops, Al Jadaf and Creek, are complete but will open at a later date pending development. Transfers are possible at Union Square and Khalid Bin Al Waleed. There are also Blue and Purple lines under construction with opening dates in the next few years.
Single tickets range from Dh2-8.50, or double that for use of the "Gold" first class carriage.  Train run every 3-5 minutes from 5:50 AM to Midnight every day except Thursday and Friday, when services are extended to 5:50 AM to 1 AM and limited to 1 PM to Midnight, respectively.  All stations are air-conditioned and there's a large network of feeder buses.
In addition, a 5 km monorail system shuttles passengers across the Palm Jumeirah to the Atlantis hotel, but it's not connected to the metro network and is thus of very limited utility.
Dubai Public transport <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://vgn.dm.gov.ae/DMEGOV/dm-trans-timetables">[15]</a> is a cheaper means of traveling within the several districts in Dubai. A map of the bus system can be found online<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.rta.ae/wpsv5/links/buses/FullBusNetwork_sm.pdf">[16]</a>, as well as detailed route maps and timetables <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.rta.ae/wpsv5/links/publictransportpdf.htm">[17]</a>. Public buses are clean and cheap, but unfortunately not very comprehensive and (on some routes) quite infrequent. The bus system is most useful for getting between different areas of central Dubai, or between the various suburbs, rather than general transport. Taxis or a fair amount of walking will also be required if you wish to visit Dubai without a car of your own.
You will require a Nol card or ticket for fare payment. Cards could be purchased from most bus stations, metro stations, and sometimes from the bus driver.
The main bus stations are Gold Souq Market (in Deira) and Al Ghubaiba bus station (in Bur Dubai). The flat fare is 2 AED, but might be higher for hour-long rides to distant suburbs. Clear route maps and time-tables are placed inside a few bus stands. Ramadan timings differ. The front seats are reserved for women.
Probably the single most useful service for the casual tourist is <b>Line 8</b>, which starts at the Gold Souq, takes the tunnel under the Creek to Heritage Village, and then sets off down Jumeirah Rd (just behind the beach) and all its hotels and malls, up to Burj al-Arab and Wild Wadi.  Line 8 terminates near the Internet City, while its 8A variant goes down a little further and also serves the Mall of the Emirates.
For a good, hop on - hop off, type tour try the Big Bus Company <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.bigbustours.com/dub/html/dub_home.html">[18]</a>. It runs two routes; the blue route through Jumeirah and the recently constructed areas, and the red route centering on the older parts of Dubai. The hub for both routes is Wafi City mall, and an 175 AED ticket covers 24 hours of riding.
Taxis ply the streets of Dubai and are relatively easy to spot. The easiest place to find them is at the taxi queue at one of the malls or outside a hotel. Waving down a taxi on the road is possible, but can be difficult during rush hours. At peak times (7-9AM &amp; 4-7PM workdays, and Friday evenings) demand far exceeds supply, and not only are taxis hard to find, but those who deign to pick you up may demand crazy off-meter fares or refuse short rides in congested areas entirely.  The standard of driving in Dubai ranges from poor to wild - taxis are some of the worst on the roads.  Taxi drivers are pretty good at knowing where the main shopping malls and hotels are, however less well known places will mean the driver calling his brother-in-law to get directions, whilst he drives around in circles on your time - hence it is a good idea to have a rough idea of where you are heading or what a nearby landmark is. It also helps to know exactly what place you are going to rather than to ask for the nearest whatever-it-is (hotel, Metro stop, etc.), as they might drive farther in order to charge you a higher fare.
Taxis are metered at 1.75 dhs/km, so no haggling is necessary.  The rates of all taxi companies &#8212; Dubai Transport, National, Cars, Metro, and Arabian &#8212; are identical, so just take the first one that comes along.  From the airport, there is a standing charge of 25 dhs; all other street pickups attract a standing charge of 3.00 dhs during the day, 3.50 at night (10 PM-6AM), but a minimum fare of 10 dhs applies, and there is a surcharge of 20 dhs for going to <a href="/en/Sharjah" title="Sharjah">Sharjah</a>.  Taxis are not exempt from the Salik road toll charges which costs an adtional 4 Dh (since January 1st 2013).  Beware of unmarked hotel taxis and limousines though: while some of these are metered, they are <i>not</i> tied to the official rates, and can be much more expensive. <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://dtc.dubai.ae/en.portal?dtctariff,Article_000031,1,&amp;_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=view">[19]</a> One way to spot whether a taxi is official or not is to look for a meter: no meter, don't get in.
If you can't find one otherwise, you can attempt to call a taxi at 04-2080808, there's a surcharge of 3 dhs to book. The booking system was notorious for its unreliability but with a significantly increased taxi fleet, many taxis now deliberately wait in unofficial holding areas waiting for bookings. As a result, on a good day it can be possible to book a taxi and have it arrive within less than five minutes. If you absolutely have to get somewhere at a certain time (say, the airport or a meeting), it's still best to book a hotel taxi in advance, <i>and</i> get their estimate of how bad the traffic will be.
Women should travel in the back of the taxi as some drivers see it as a sexual invitation if you get in the front.
There are a countless number of Rent-A-Cars that will provide a mode of transportation for very cheap rates and very little paperwork. An International Driving Permit is not necessarily required, but hire companies may not rent a car without one.  (is not required only for major european and gulf countries, however strictly required for other countries like Russia etc., according to RTA)
Some agencies will hire out cars complete with drivers. Visitors taking advantage of this option will need to make certain that their driver knows his way around as many do not.
When driving on the main roads, such as Sheikh Zayed road, the junction numbers are not in logical order. Junction 13 is just after Junction 18 and are rarely as shown on the maps. Road names can also be very confusing with slight differences in spelling (due to different transliterations from Arabic) being very important. The construction work that is taking place throughout and around Dubai can make finding your destination a challenge. Temporary road layouts change with alarming regularity and temporary signs can be misleading or non existent. As GPS maps are not up to date (and usually not anyway available to rent with hire cars), you will be very well off with a printed map (you can get an excellent one in Virgin stores, for example. There is a Virgin Megastore on the top floor of City Center).
Driving during morning and afternoon peak hours is not recommended, as traffic slows to a standstill and even a simple trip across a bridge can take up to 45 minutes. There is also a scarcity of parking spaces in many parts of the city.
With such a mixture of nationalities residing in the city, driving styles are mixed to say the least. Both dangerous and experienced driving will be witnessed or experienced frequently, and bear in mind that Dubai has one of the highest per capita road death rates in the world. There is zero tolerance for alcohol and driving with stiff penalties meted out including jail and deportation.
See Salik.ae <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.salik.ae">[20]</a> for information about <b>toll</b> to pay on certain routes in Dubai. If you rent a car, usually a Salik tag will be provided by the car hire company and you will be charged separately when returning the car.
<b>Note on Navigation systems:</b> In case you are renting a car, you definitely want a navigation system. Even people living there need GPS. For this, you have 2 options: You can rent a GPS or get a car with navigation system. Or you can get data service with your smart phone and use google map or other navigation systems on smart phones. I found the second method much more cost effective.
An easier way of crossing the Dubai Creek is by <i>abra</i>, essentially a small ferry. Abra stations are located along the Creek on both the Bur Dubai and Deira sides, and the system of filling the boats is remarkably efficient. The cross-river trip costs 1 Dirham (AED 1) per passenger, payable to the driver after the boat has left the station, and affords <b>a very picturesque view of the city</b> (not to be missed). Abras set off very regularly, and the service is available round-the-clock.
Abras can also be hired for a private tour (for a price negotiable with the driver but usually very cheap). This is quite a popular activity at sunset on a clear day, particularly if the driver is able to enliven the tour with stories about the structures on either side of the Creek. Just make sure that the purpose of one's <i>abra</i> hire is made clear at the outset--otherwise you will be in for a very expensive cross-river trip or a crowded private tour.
The Waterbus is another option for tourists who want to go by boat but avoid the abra crowd (or the heat). It is a part of Dubai's public transport system, so again a Red ticket, or any Nol card is required for the journey. Can be purchased at the waterbus station.
The waterbus also features a 'tourist route' round trip - while it is convenient, it can get quite expensive (Dh50 for an adult, Dh25 for a child)
The Creek is also the home of many boats offering more comfortable (and correspondingly more expensive) tours, often in boats designed to resemble dhows. Prices tend to be higher, particularly for dinner cruises with on-board entertainment.
Don't miss Dubai's overwhelming shopping malls, listed under <a href="#Buy">Buy</a>.
Shows are every 30 minutes from 6pm to 10pm on weekdays and from 6pm to 11pm on weekends. It's the worldâs largest dancing fountain with classical, Arabic and world music. About 1.5 million lumens of projected light and the spray heights of up to 150m/500 ft (22,000 gallons of airborne water).
Dubai has set up a free-zone Knowledge Village <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.kv.ae/">[34]</a> to house institutes and universities, providing both on-line and in-class training. The city also has the American University in Dubai <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.aud.edu">[35]</a>.
While Dubai tries to promote itself as the business and entertainment capital of the world, the government has a complex and at times frustrating work permit procedure that one should not attempt on their own unless they have prior experience. Therefore, it is best to go through official channels when looking for work in Dubai as spot inspections are frequent and if found working illegally, both the employee and the employer will be subject to fines and even deportation.
All the necessary forms and documents are written and processed in Arabic and is best left to a professional or a "P.R.O" to handle your paperwork.
There are rules about changing jobs and its frequency. This rules are equally applicable for all nationalies. They have to complete their contract period, which is 2 years. If the employee breaks his/her contract before the completion of 2 years, the new employer has to offer them salary above 5000 AED in-order to avoid ban. Otherwise the employee has to wait until the completion of the left over months of his cancelled contract.If the employer breaks the contracts, then the employee can join another employer immediately irrespective of nationality , religion, cast or creed.
With the price of rentals ever soaring in Dubai and neighbouring Emirates, it is a good idea to discuss a housing allowance when negotiating a pay package.
Despite all this, there are a few upsides, Dubai companies are generous with holidays averaging almost 39 days a year of paid vacation (including public holidays), a round trip ticket home once a year (depending on your contract) and most importantly all your earnings are 100% tax free. This includes Western <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.teachaway.com">teachers</a> working for one of many English-language academies.
Recruitment fraud is quite pervasive in this part of the world. Read your employment contract carefully before signing and do not pay any fees to recruitment agencies, as they are usually paid by the companies. Your passport is your personal property and cannot be withheld by the employer unless you are in a position of trust or are handling large sums of money.
Dubai has been accused by numerous organizations of effectively enslaving workers from Southeast Asia by allowing companies to take their passports without returning them and allowing salaries to go unpaid.  Foreign workers, Western and otherwise, have no rights that will be upheld by the courts, and so they have no recourse should they feel their rights violated.  Potential workers should be aware of this when considering work in Dubai.
Dubai is practically synonymous with shopping. The huge amounts of cargo passing through its port and the low tariffs ensure that practically anything is available at fairly competitive rates, although the appreciation of the Dirham, and the plentiful supply of shoppers means that Dubai is no longer a bargain basement shopping city. You'll also find products in western chain stores, still with the original tags quoting euro or sterling prices, being sold with a 20-30% mark-up once converted to Dirhams.
The best things to buy in Dubai are textiles, electronics and gold, electronics is believed to be much cheaper while textiles and gold offer a wide range of selection.
Even in the mega-malls, Dubai shops have no storeroom and no stocks in reserve - and for clothes shopping this may mean that you may struggle to find the style you want in the size you want.  Shops open as early as 9AM and stay open to 10PM and on weekends to 12AM and some stay to 1AM.
Remember to haggle in the souks, as discounts are almost always available and even in situations where the item will not become much cheaper, the customer is always expected to "play the game" of haggling. A simple question of "what's your best price?" will often result in a shop-keeper going to extraordinary lengths to sell his stock.
Prices in the malls and other Western shops tend not to be negotiable. Far from being a bad thing, this allows the canny visitor to work out comparative prices for common souvenirs - an invaluable aid when a shop-keeper in a souk is asking for a higher price.
<b>Dubai Shopping Festival</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://mydsf.ae/en/depe/dubaiShoppingFestival.aspx">[36]</a> has been the biggest shopping event in the middle east since 1996. Almost every shop has a sale, starting in January and ending February.  There's also a very similar <b>Dubai Summer Surprises</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.mydsf.com/dss/eng/dss_home.aspx">[37]</a> trying to pull in punters during the summer low season.
<b>TIP:</b> Several malls have a large Carrefour, or similar, hypermarket where you'll find the lowest cost electronics, and groceries for self-catering. A Carrefour is also located near the Shindagha waterfront in Bur Dubai.
<b>Shawarma</b> is the most available food item on almost all streets (and cheap!) in Dubai. It is the Arabic equivalent of the Burger. It is meat that has been cooked on a skewer and then cut into thin strips and placed into a kuhbus (<i>pita</i>) bread with vegetables and dressing. It costs about AED 6 ($1.9) for either the plain-jane variety or the more exotic Lebanese and Iranian varities. The Shawarma sold by Indian restaurants are arguably the cheapest.
Another local snacks is <b>Fala-Fil</b> (Felafel, Falafel) also available at about the same costs as the shawarma.
<br />
Most of the American fast food chains have set up shop in Dubai, including KFC, Chillis, TGI Fridays, Starbucks, and McDonalds. The beauty of the food in Dubai is that you will probably find cuisine for every taste.
For Indians (and vegetarians), Dubai has a big selection of budget Indian vegetarian food. Dosa, vada, idlee, samosa, chapaati/roti, with generous servings of sabji (cooked vegetable stew) are available at throwaway prices, typically less than 10Dhs ($2.5) per course. The more expensive stuff costs upto USD 5.00. Bur Dubai (particularly Meena Bazaar area) and Karama are the places that abound in these restaurants. Most of them are open from 7AM till 10PM or 11PM throughout the week.
As mentioned earlier, Dubai is a melting pot for various cultures who have bought their local cuisines over with them. For those who are open to trying new and different foods , Frying Pan Adventures  <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.fryingpanadventures.com/">[50]</a> offers food tours that allows visitors to try various regional foods while at the same time exploring less known parts of Dubai.
<br />
The top hotels in the city all have at least one restaurant serving (most commonly) some form of international cuisine - Italian, Japanese, Indian and so on. Quality tends to be high, along with price, but non-guests are able to reserve tables as well, thus allowing the rest of us to experience a bit of these hotels.
<br />
<br />
If you feel like having a meal fit for a king, but don't want to venture outside, Room Service <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.roomservice.ae/">[63]</a> can deliver meals from upscale restaurants to your residence for a price.
As Dubai has grown from a small town into a bustling city, so has the nightlife scene. Most 3 to 5 star hotels have bars and nightclubs for those interested in the nightlife. World-class DJs frequent Dubai's nightclubs, and many A-list musical celebrities are adding Dubai to their list of tour dates.
However, Dubai has several laws regarding alcohol which tourists should be aware of before visiting:
<br />
Earlier the demand for hotel rooms outstripped badly supply, resulting in some of the most expensive rooms in the world: it was difficult to find anything decent for under Dhs 600 (US$200) especially during the September-May high season. However, now, as July 2009, there are several five star hotels offering rooms for less than $140 (â¬100) for off-season.

<span class='vcard' ></span>
Dubai has its share of problems. Dubai strictly follows Islamic laws which must be respected by all travelers. Islam is the official religion, therefore do not publicly criticize or distribute material against it. Eating in public during the holy month of Ramadan is prohibited from sunrise until sunset and visitors should consume meals in the confines of their hotel or residence.
In conversations about politics and world affairs, avoid criticizing the ruling family of any of the seven Emirates or prominent business families. The United Arab Emirates does not have any formal relations with Israel, and the government publicly supports any cause that involves the Palestinian people or Palestinian statehood.
While petty crime is hardly reported or mentioned in the news, keep an eye on your wallet or purse when in crowded areas like Naser Square or Deira in general. If withdrawing large amounts of cash from ATM's or banking institutions, either conceal the notes or ask the institution's security to escort you to your vehicle. Cases have occurred where people have been robbed of large amounts of cash when in crowded places just because they were not careful.
Conmen are ever present in Dubai, especially the "Nigeria 419" scammers. Do not arrange meetings or entertain their requests or give any personal details. Should they not comply, individuals who will be happy to listen to their business propositions are the police.
Thanks to Dubai's new property boom, real estate fraudsters are also popping up, so exercise caution if you are there to shop around for a new home.
Public display of affection are frowned upon and public sexual acts can lead to jail time followed by deportation. In 2008, a British couple were arrested and faced jail sentences because they had sexual contact on a beach in Dubai. If all tourists remain respectful and decent at all times and ensure that they do not upset the local people in any way whatsoever, there should hopefully be no problems.
The United Arab Emirates might seem to have more relaxed laws than their other Arab counterparts, but the laws are still very different from most Western countries, and their laws are strictly enforced. A simple kiss in a public place, having an alcoholic drink in the wrong place or even losing your temper could land you a month or more in jail. Please exercise caution and common sense when visiting and make sure you are aware of all their laws, or expect severe consequences that could seriously ruin your vacation and/or life.
Homosexuality, along with sexual relations outside of marriage, is a criminal offense with possible deportation. Public displays of affection or cross-dressing may lead to jail time and/or deportation should be avoided completely in public to ensure that no problems arise.
Women should dress sensibly and avoid wearing revealing outfits when in busy areas. This is especially true when traveling to districts like Karama, Deira and Bur-Dubai,where the streets are packed with men, especially on evenings and weekends. While swimsuits and bikinis are a common sight on Dubai beaches, avoid sunbathing topless or wearing microbikinis--even in the private beach of a hotel.
Drug use and distribution are serious criminal offences, even when in the company of the person consuming the material, and can lead to a prison sentence of several years or even to be in front of the firing squad. Passenger baggage is screened quite thoroughly when entering Dubai. Even prescription drugs (without original prescription note) or ones that you bought over the counter in your country can lead to a prison sentence.<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.fairtrials.net/index.php/news/article/list_of_controlled_pharmaceutical_substances_in_uae/">[112]</a><a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.moh.gov.ae/admincp/assetsmanager/files/pharmacusts/updated%20controlled%20medical%20list%20seperated%202007.pdf">[113]</a>
Driving and pedestrian safety has also been an issue given the different nationalities that share the road. Do not jaywalk or cross where there are no clear pedestrian markings. Speeding is common here, and the odds of you being knocked over are quite high unless you follow the rules. Avoid driving on the extreme left lane of highways to avoid being "flashed" and being forced to move a lane over. Road rage is also starting to become an issue given the increase in traffic jams and poor driving courtesy.
Rude hand gestures (the "finger", etc.) and profanity can lead to fines and jail times if reported, so keep your cool if you are cut off or are behind an erratic driver. In general, you will find those gestures and actions that some may find only slightly offensive in your home country--or perhaps not offensive at all--can at times be extremely offensive to the Dubai locals. Therefore, use a degree of common sense of what is right and wrong to help you stay out of trouble.
Please be aware of the travel scammers in Dubai. Normally their "representatives" are found in / around the shopping malls, sitting in fancy stalls where they will tell if you answer their question, you will win a gift (I was asked to tell the names of 3 Arabian countries ending in "N"), they will even help you answering the question by giving you clear hints!!
Next they will congratulate you on answering the question and winning a "surprise" gift. They will have your contact details written on a piece of paper and will invite you to join their "party" tomorrow where you will receive your "free" gift. There are also their reps in the shopping malls who will collect from you your contact details and will say they will contact you if you win in the "lucky draw" tonight!
And then you will start receiving calls from their company the next day seeking your confirmation to attend.
When you go to their well decorated office the next day, one of their rep will have a meeting with you for at least more than one and a half hours! Doing nothing but wasting your time and forcing you to buy one of their travel packages (staying for 36 nights or so in five star hotels around the world during coming five years on "discounted" rates etc.). You will find it a bit difficult to get rid of them once you join them. Never ever give them any money, your financial details - simply avoid their reps in the shopping malls etc.
The international code for UAE is +971, for Dubai, add a 4 afterwards for land lines.
Local mobile phone numbers will start +971 50 xxx yyyy or +971 56 xxx yyyy (newly introduced as of second half of 2008) for the GSM provider etisalat <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.etisalat.ae">[114]</a> and +971 55 xxx yyyy and +971 52 xxx yyyy for the GSM provider du <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.du.ae">[115]</a>.
<b>GSM</b>&#8212; Those with GSM phones can expect auto roaming from their home countries. As roaming fees are quite high (easily 3 USD per minute and often more for a call to Europe) and incoming calls are also charged, consider to buy a local prepaid GSM SIM card, designed especially for tourists, from one of the two cellular providers of the U.A.E.:
Using these products, calls to Europe will be charged at maximum of about 0.55 USD per minute. Incoming calls are free of charge.
<b>Phone Booths</b>&#8212; Phone booths are located on most streets. Phone cards can be purchased from hotels and tourist shops.
<b>Internet</b> &#8212; Internet cafÃ©s can be hard to find. The usual rate per hour is 3-4 AED. There are a number of cafÃ©s on Al Musalla Rd./Al Mankhool Rd. in <i>Bur Dubai</i>, including one at 38 Al Musalla Rd. and one at Computer Plaza next to the Ramada Hotel. A number of Internet cafes are found in <i>Satwa</i> too. In Satwa there is the French Connection in the Al Wafa Tower on Sheikh Zayed road (opposite side of road from the Dusit Hotel), which has wi-fi access and nice cakes/pastries. In <i>Al Qusais</i>, there is an internet cafÃ© a five-minute walk northwest from the Dubai Youth Hostel. Turn right out of the gates and walk to LuLu's Hypermarket. The cafÃ© is located inside the food court and currently charges AED 4.00 per hour.  Note that the Skype website has recently been unblocked by the two major service providers, Du and Etisalat (which are also the only service providers and are both owned by the government). You may wish to consider using a proxy or VPN to bypass the blocked websites in the UAE, but this is considered illegal in the eyes of local officials, and can lead to penalties or jail time.
Surprisingly, the malls do not have internet cafÃ©s, but most have wi-fi, mostly free. Most hotel business centres are equipped with internet cafÃ©s, but are expensive ones.
Etisalat <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.eim.ae">[118]</a>, UAE's telecom operator, offers a roaming, post paid wi-fi internet connection known as iZone <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://ecompany.ae/eco/isp/english/services/izone/index.html">[119]</a>. Most coffee shops and malls across Dubai provide this service. Prices are available on the website.
Dubai International Airport (DXB) has free wi-fi in the terminal. Bring your laptop with you for using free wi-fi at some hotels.
<b>Newspapers &amp; Radio</b>: Thanks to the large influx of expatriates, Dubai has a wide selection of English Language Newspapers and Radio Channels.
International Newspapers are also available in most hotels and airport terminals. Carrefour and Borders bookstores sell British and American newspapers. Todaily <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.todaily.com">[133]</a>, a local printing house, can furnish newspapers and periodicals from around the world daily.
<b>Sheikh Mohammed Centre for Cultural Understanding</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.cultures.ae/">[134]</a>, is a non-profit community service organization that has been set up to bring down barriers between people of different nationalities, and to help understand the traditions, customs and religion of the UAE. The SMCCU, under the banner, Open Doors Open Minds organizes educational and social events, that allows its clients to exchange ideas, pursue learning and share ways to reach understanding for their companies, their families, their countries and the world.
Some of the activities that are offered at the center include:
If you are walking through the streets,  you will most probably come across people wanting to sell you pirated movies or anything else that can be replicated or faked. They will tend to lead you off the streets into a alley and into a building. This can seem to be very dangerous but you will find that 90 percent of the time it will be what they actually claim it to be. This is done because they have to hide from the police. Also, don't take very much money with you, otherwise they will ask for all the money you have. A typical pirated DVD should cost about 10-15 dirhams, although purchasing pirated DVDs should be avoided as, not only is it illegal and with most crimes in Dubai they are very punishable, the DVD will probably be of very poor quality.
Dubai gives freedom of religion to its residents and citizens, Pork is consumed here mostly by Filipinos and Europeans. Pork sections exclusive for Non-Muslims are found in <b>Spinneys</b> (have numerous branches, they have one in Jumeirah and another in Dubai Marina and many others), <b>Al Maya Lal's</b> (generally caters to Filipinos, they have a branch in Satwa) <b>New Westzone Supermarket</b> (have a branch in Satwa, it's bigger than nearby rival Al Maya Lal's). 
<b>St. Mary's Catholic Church</b> is a Roman Catholic church located in Oud Metha opposite the Indian High School, it has masses celebrated in Tagalog and other Indian languages as well as in Arabic aside from English.  While <b>Holy Trinity Church</b> is a Protestant Church is located too in Oud Metha.
