<b>Marrakech</b> (ÙØ±Ø§ÙØ´), also known as <i>Marrakesh</i>, is one of the imperial cities of <a href="/en/Morocco" title="Morocco">Morocco</a>.
The name Marrakech originates from the Amazigh (Berber) words <b>mur (n) akush</b>, which means "Land of God." It is the third largest city in Morocco after Casablanca and Rabat, and lies near the foothills of the snow capped Atlas Mountains and a few hours away from the foot of the Sahara Desert. Its location and contrasting landscape has made it an enviable destination in Morocco.
The city is divided into two distinct parts: the Medina, the historical city, and the new European modern district called Gueliz or Ville Nouvelle. The Medina is full of intertwining narrow passageways and local shops full of character. In contrast, Gueliz plays host to modern restaurants, fast food chains and big brand stores.

Terminal 1 has two money changing outlets in the Arrivals hall and one in Departures. Terminal 2 had ATMs, but (as of March 2012) is currently being re-built from the ground up. On ATMs, check for the Maestro, Cirrus or Plus logos to be sure that the machine accepts foreign credit cards. Beware as some of the ATMs work only in French. If your card is taken at the ATM, tell airport security and they can help you get it back.
ATMs generally dispense only 100 and 200 dirham notes so getting change for small everyday purchases like water, taxis etc can be a challenge. At weekends you may have difficulty acquiring cash as machines are not generally restocked until the following Monday. Sometimes your card may work in some machines and not others, or may support smaller withdrawals rather than larger ones, and may work at some times and not others. You should ensure you have a backup means of funding your visit. ATMs usually dispense a maximum of 2000Dh but other limits may apply dependent on your bank.
INWI has a booth in the arrival hall where you can purchase a SIM card for your unlocked phone (they can punch micro SIMs). One GB of data, 3 hours of local calling, and 1000 text mags for 120 MAD. Coverage as of Oct. 2013 seems to be only EDGE in Marrakech; however, it's very valuable for GPS navigation in the souks.
The airport is located about 5km (3 miles) from the city. There is an air conditioned airport bus every 30m that costs 30dh one way, 50dh return.
The taxis at the airport are totally dishonest and they act as an organised mob.  The price on the metre to the airport is 15dh, but the official price is four times that 60dh and even this is not enough for these greedy people.  They will try to point at the wrong sign showing 100dh (which is actually for a place 20km away), or ask for more because it's night.  The best way to deal with them is to totally ignore those just outside the terminal and walk across the car park where you will find lots more taxis waiting.  Offer them 40dh, they will say "no, that's ridiculous etc" but once you start walking away towards the roundabout one of them will pull up behind you and say "ok, 50dh".  If you really want to save money you can walk to the roundabout and catch a taxi there for the metre fare (15dh-20dh to the old town/Gueliz).
If you don't have too much luggage then it's possible to walk from the airport to the Medina even though it would take you from an hour and half to two hours. There is a footpath alongside the road all the way and the minaret of the Koutoubia mosque provides an excellent landmark to head towards. If you have enough time you can break the trip with a visit to the Menara gardens, which are between the airport and the city.
The No 19 Airport express bus is Dh 30 for a single trip or Dh 50 for round trip (if the return trip is within 2 weeks of initial purchase). It serves all the major hotels and is a great way to go from the airport to the hotels. You can easily find its departure stop, to the left of the road immediately outside of the Arrivals Hall at terminal 2, after the taxis. The bus leaves the airport every half an hour between 7Am and 9:30PM. The bus has no particular stops except Jeema El Fna and can stop anywhere on the route. The driver has a small map to hand out and you can tell the driver your hotel you're heading to.
You can also catch No 11 city bus which runs from M'Hamid district to the long distance bus station at Bab Doukkala, stopping also at Jeema El Fna. It stops on Avenue Gnassa - main road near airport, 500 metres from terminal. This is an option only for people without large, heavy luggage, but it is the cheapest one - the bus costs Dh 3.5
The airport is located about 5&#160;km (3 miles) from the city, which is about a 15-20 min ride by "petit taxi."  Petits taxis are small or normal sized cars that go to destinations within the city and charge a lower price than the larger "grands taxis," which go between cities.  If you leave from the airport by petit taxi, make sure to agree on the price beforehand, or, better yet, have the driver use his meter (a taxi ride to Ville Nouvelle or to Medina from the airport should be Dh 50-80, more at night).  In practice, most petit taxi drivers have agreed among themselves to an artificially high rate to or from the airport - most will quote you Dh 100 each way, and half again that much at night. They can be very pushy and like to get you locked inside the vehicle before they reveal the price and will always demand the fare up front. You should never pay more than Dh 60 (the official price which is already 3 times the meter fare) from the airport to the centre of the city for a petit taxi.
If you don't mind walking 200m, you can avoid the theives altogether by catching a petit taxi at the roundabout (about a 10 minute walk).  Just tell them where you want to go and check that they switch on the meter (about 15-20dh). If they ask "first time in Morocco" always say no, I have come to Morocco many times, I have family/friends in <a href="/en/Casablanca" title="Casablanca">Casablanca</a> or <a href="/en/Agadir" title="Agadir">Agadir</a> etc. This discourages them from ripping you off. You can usually get a driver to take you into the centre from the airport for 40-50dh simply by being prepared to haggle, be patient and play the game, but make sure you walk across to the other side of the car park as the one's just outside the terminal are the most aggrestive and dishonest and they work together as a cartel of theives.  Once they see you walking away towards the roundabout, they will come down to 40dh.
If you don't want to play this game, you can call <b>Taxis Verts</b> (a cab company, 05 24 40 94 94). Meter is compulsory for them, they should have a sticker on the windshield with their tariffs. They will take you at the drop-off, which is at the level of the parking, 50 m in front of you outside the terminal. The fare is around 70-80 Dh for La Palmeraie and 30-40 Dh for the centre. <b>Always ask the meter&#160;!</b>
If you are travelling from the airport to somewhere further afield (such as Essaouira), your hotel or guest house may be able to arrange a grand taxi to pick you up at the airport and charge a fixed price for the journey. Grands taxis are generally more expensive than petits taxis, but they are allowed to take up to 6 passengers rather than 3 and they are a bit bigger. It also avoids hassle, as it's not always easy to haggle with a taxi driver after staggering off a long plane ride half-asleep.
Several international <a href="/en/Renting_a_car" title="Renting a car">rental car</a> companies are based at the airport as well.
The train station is in the recently developed GuÃ©liz district at Avenue Hassan II, â +212 447768. For train times and schedules, check out the Moroccan Railway website <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.oncf.ma">[2]</a>.
That train station has ATMs, an INWI cellphone store (purchase a SIM here), a post office, and multiple cafes. Tickets for the trains can be purchased from a person at the guichets or from an ONCF kiosk which accepts credit cards (French and English). Supratours also has an office where you can purchase bus tickets.
Trains from <a href="/en/Casablanca" title="Casablanca">Casablanca</a> (2nd class Dh84/ 1st class Dh150, 3 hours), <a href="/en/Rabat" title="Rabat">Rabat</a> and <a href="/en/Tangier" title="Tangier">Tangier</a> connect with most domestic rail destinations in the country, with Marrakech as the southernmost stop. Trains run regularly between Marrakech and Casablanca (including the International Airport). They arrive around every two hours and regularly from other destinations like <a href="/en/Rabat" title="Rabat">Rabat</a>. Every day there are 8 direct 7 hour trains to Fez via Casablanca Voyageurs station and another two direct connections to Tangier.
<b>Tangier:</b> For those wishing to travel by train from <a href="/en/Tangier" title="Tangier">Tangier</a> it's about a 10 hour journey. You can travel either by day train or night train.  During the daytime, you will need to change trains for a connection halfway through the journey creating a welcome break for about 30 mins. The night trains which leaves for Marrakech from <a href="/en/Tangier" title="Tangier">Tangier</a> travels straight through to Marrakech without the need for a connection. The night trains do have sleeper cars on board, though you will need to pay extra for these if you want a bed (around Dh 350).
<b>Notice,</b> that if you're planning to go cheap and take the night train on the regular seats in second class (and planning to sleep...), you'll be interupted by movement of the passengers and a few times by the ticket conductors throughout the night. Bottom line- it's a great way to go, but (especially if you're traveling alone), don't plan on sleeping on the train.
There is currently no train line further south than Marrakech in Morocco; if you want to head south, to the desert, Atlas Mountains, Agadir or Essaouira on the coast, you'll have to get a bus, rental car or grand taxi.
<b>Travel tips:</b> Moroccan trains do not have restaurant cars. A snack trolley makes the rounds with sandwiches, soft drinks and coffee, but bringing some food for the journey isn't a bad idea. Stops in Casablanca and Rabat usually are long enough to grab a bite in the station enroute.
There are many long distance bus companies operating within Morocco which serve Marrakech and other cities.
The recommended bus companies for tourists are <b>CTM</b>, <b>Pullman du sud</b> and <b>Supratours</b>. Other companies do exist, though these three companies are usually your safest options. There is a Supratours office inside the main hall of the Marrakech railway station.
Most ALSA (local destination bus company) and private bus lines arrive at the <b>long distance bus station</b> near Bab Doukkala, a 20 min walk (Dh 15 - 20 by <i>petit taxi</i>) from Djemaa El-Fna. Supratours and Eurolines buses operate from here. It's the place to take the buses from the small companies, that go directly to small destinations.
The long distance bus station, CTM and private bus companies travel to destinations such as <a href="/en/Agadir" title="Agadir">Agadir</a>, <a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Safi&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Safi (page does not exist)">Safi</a>, <a href="/en/Casablanca" title="Casablanca">Casablanca</a>, <a href="/en/El_Jadida" title="El Jadida">El Jadida</a>, <a href="/en/Essaouira" title="Essaouira">Essaouira</a>, <a href="/en/Fez" title="Fez">Fez</a>, <a href="/en/Meknes" title="Meknes">Meknes</a>, <a href="/en/Ouarzazate" title="Ouarzazate">Ouarzazate</a>, <a href="/en/Rabat" title="Rabat">Rabat</a>, and <a href="/en/Taroudant" title="Taroudant" class="mw-redirect">Taroudant</a>. Taxi touts will often gather in the bus station to convince you that a bus to your destination is 'full' and to steer you into a grand taxi, and will attempt to sell you goods as your taxi is prepared. This can be difficult if there is nobody manning the ticket desks, and the best option is to walk out of the station to the coaches - a ticket can usually be purchased from a conductor on board.
For trips to <a href="/en/Meknes" title="Meknes">Meknes</a> (6h, ~120 Dh) be advised, that while seemingly shorter on the map, the mountain route via <a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Beni_Millal&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Beni Millal (page does not exist)">Beni Millal</a> takes at least 2 hours more than on the highway via <a href="/en/Rabat" title="Rabat">Rabat</a> and Casa, going there by train (6Â½h, 174 Dh) is the most comfortable option, although busses might be slightly quicker.
For those interested in overnight transit to Tangier, there is an overnight bus that leaves the main bus station at midnight every night (8h, 160 Dh).  This is a great alternative for the overnight train to Tangier, as there's no need to transfer, the bus is almost nonstop (besides one or two breaks), and the journey is 2 hours shorter than the overnight train.  Tickets can be purchased at the long-distance bus station (look for the ticket window operating buses to Rabat).  CTM also operates overnight services to Tangier (9h, ~220 Dh).
CTM operates a brand new bus station "Gare Voyageurs" one block south from the Supratour station next to the train station. It's better to take the buses there, because you can buy the tickets in advance. Besides, the CTM's offices there are better and there's no people trying to push you to their bus company. The office and station on Zerktouni street does not exist anymore. CTM has also an office at the long distance bus station (see above) if you just want to buy your tickets in advance or check the schedule.
Once in the medina, everything can be seen <b>on foot</b>, though you'll be doing a lot of walking. GPS is invaluable if you do not want to constantly rely on the help of locals to find your way. For exploring more of the city, <b>buses</b> and <b>petits taxis</b> are plentiful.
Almost all buses stop at Djemaa El-Fna and Place Youssef Ben Tachfine and fares range from Dh 2 - 5 depending on the distance. Important municipal bus lines are:
Bus No 19 leaves Djemaa el-Fna every half an hour, starting at 6:15AM in the morning until 9:15PM. The trip to the airport takes about 25 minutes.
There is an open-topped <b>City Sightseeing bus</b> that will take you around the outskirts of the city, with commentary provided via headphones (supplied with your ticket) in any of 8 different languages. The best place to catch it is from the coach stops by Square de Foucauld. Tickets cost Dh 145 each and are valid for 24 hours from the time of issue, no matter how many times you get on or off. However, check the timetable carefully, as the buses can stop running earlier than you might think.
An alternative and romantic way to travel is by <b>caleche</b> - pronounced <i>kutchee</i> - a small horse-drawn carriage. They can be hired at Square de Foucauld (the small park at the bottom of Djemaa El-Fna). It's wise to agree on a price before setting off. As a guide price, you should pay around DH 80 per hour, per carriage.
If getting around by taxi, just bear in mind that taxi drivers will make up many excuses to rip you off; for example:<br />
- They don't have change.<br />
- They will hustle you to charge for everything such as bags. But you don't need to pay for extras.<br />
- For <i>petit taxi</i>, the maximum number of passengers is three (plus the driver). Sometimes you need to share with other passengers. If you are a group of two or three people, you just pay the one price and share with others (example, 10Dh for three passengers).<br />
- Generally during the day time you will pay about 10dh, at night you should pay no more than 20dh.
- The minimum charge is Dh7 before 8pm and after will be 10Dh. <br />
- Dh 20 is a good price for a 10 min ride.<br />
- For Grand Taxis (Regular Mercedes Taxis) there are no meters. Typically the set rate from Marrakech Airport to the Medina or Jemaa el fna (Main square) is 150Dh. There also appears to be no limit to the amount of people they'll attempt to squeeze in! Outside of the airport if you are a group of more than three, the maximum for a Petit Taxi, then do negotiate you fee before you enter the Grand Taxi.
Always ask to use the meter (<i>compteur</i> in French); otherwise, you are just contributing to a culture of ripping off people.
During the day you can generally get them to use the meter (if they refuse, just get stop another one).  At night, tell them "ashreen" (20dh).
If you go to nightlife locations, avoid the taxis that are waiting outside as these are theives and they can extort you. It's best to get the telephone number of someone honest and ask them to pick you up.  
Other locations where the theives wait is near Jema el Fna square and at tourist sites. Here it is best to stop a taxi that is just passing in the street and not those that are sitting there waiting.  Generally the older and more beat up the taxi and the older the driver, the better.  The less they talk the better also (no "where are you from, first time in Marocco etc").
There is much to see and do in Marrakech.  An entire day can be dedicated to wandering around all the different souks, seeking out the best bargains. The city also offers several historical and architectural sites as well as some interesting museums.
The old, historic district of the city.
The main square in the Medina is Djemaa El-Fna. It is surrounded by endless labyrinths of souks (bazaars) and alley ways covering all of the Medina. Djemma El-Fna is a must as there is always something to see there day and night whether it be snake charmers, acrobats, sooth-sayers,or the musicians and food stalls. At night the square really comes to life as people navigate toward the exotic aromas and the entertaining sights. As the evening darkens, the hustle &amp; bustle of activity rages on. The exotic music appears louder and more hypnotic.
The Medina is also the place to stay in a Riad, a Moroccan house with an internal courtyard. Most windows are inward facing towards the central atrium. This design of property suits Islamic tradition as there is no obvious wealth statement being made externally, no windows to peer through. Entering a Riad is like discovering an Aladdinâs Cave in comparison to its non-descript exterior. They are great places to stay and offer an intimate and relaxing retreat.
Directly south of the Djemaa El-Fna is Rue Bab Agnaou. A five minute walk takes you straight to the famous Bab Agnaou  entrance to the Kasbah district of the Medina. The Bab Agnaou entrance, through the ramparts, is by far the most impressive entrance of all medina rampart entrances.
The Kasbah, in comparison to the Derbs (streets) surrounding the Djemaa El-Fna, portrays a calmer, less abrasive atmosphere. It is home to the Royal Palace, also the former El - Badi Palace and the Saadian Tombs. This naturally creates better security, cleaner streets and a hint of being a special place within the medina. The Kasbah has its own little bazaars (Souikas), food stalls, restaurants, hotels and riads for travellers to enjoy.
<i><b>Dirhams</b></i> are officially designated a closed currency, meaning it can only be traded within Morocco, however, they are being sold and bought in travel agencies and at major airports in several countries (notably the UK). The import and export of the currency is tolerated up to a limit of DH1000. Currency purchased during a visit to Morocco should be converted back before departing the country, with the exception of the DH1000 level. You're advised to keep the receipts of currency exchange, as these will be required for the conversion  back to foreign currency prior to departure, when you can change as many dirhams as you have left.
At Marrakech airport the exchange rate is very similar to that in the town centre, so there is not much loss in waiting to the last minute to change your remaining dirhams.  Once through to embarkation you can no longer spend dirhams, only foreign currency, so make sure you have no unwanted dirhams left.
Most of the main foreign currencies may be exchanged at a Bureau de Change in the airport or port upon arrival, at a bank and in most hotels although smaller hotels in more remote areas may not be able to exchange large amounts at one time without prior notice. 
Most hotels will exchange at the same rate as banks and without charging commission. Exchanging money in the street is illegal, so travellers should look for an official Bureaux de Change which is identifiable by a golden sign.
When bringing paper currency into Morocco (US Dollars, British Pounds, Euros etc.), these must be in good condition--no tears or ink marks. Do not bring Scottish or Irish Sterling notes as they are impossible to cash  as are Australian and New Zealand notes.  Beware of bringing in brand new designs of banknotes, for example when the Bank of England introduced the new 'Adam Smith' Â£20 note in March 2007, the Moroccan banks would not change them as their records only showed the older, and at that time still legal, 'Sir Edward Elgar' Â£20 notes.
Don't bring coins in your currency to use as tips as they are hard for the locals to exchange and they get a very poor rate of exchange so have to pester other tourists to try and change them.
Some shops, Riads/hotels and especially restaurants quote prices in euros and dirhams; in the days where there were 10 dirhams to the euro it made conversion easy, now â¬1 is approximately equivalent to DH11 but some traders still prefer to use the rate of ten to one which means you are slightly overcharged. Some traders will not give change when paying in pounds or Euros!
If your Riad or hotel has only quoted in Euros (many do to make it easier for guests to understand) ask for the price in Dirhams so you can pay in the local currency.
Current exchange rates can be checked at <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.xe.com/ucc">http://www.xe.com/ucc</a>. Please remember that the rates provided by xe.com are for wholesale transfers but are generally close to the exact rates of exchange found in Morocco.
Most credit cards are accepted (especially Visa, MasterCard), although surcharges will likely apply as the cost of credit card processing in Morocco is fairly expensive for businesses. Do be aware that only a relatively small amount of businesses in Morocco have the ability to accept credit cards, although the number is growing slowly.
Advise your bank or card issuer that you intend to travel abroad so that no block will be put on the usage of your credit or ATM cards. Notify the issuer and give them a 'phone number where you can be contacted abroad. 
Before travelling, ensure you make a note of all credit card numbers and associated contact numbers for card issuers in case of difficulty. The numbers are usually free to call as you can reverse the charges, make it clear to the operator at your hotel, riad etc that you wish the call charge to be reversed. Preferably get a pre-paid card, with good exchange rates and low withdrawal fees eg fairFX.
When making payments with a credit card, for example at a hotel for services, it is vital to memorise the PIN as signatures in many instances are no longer accepted, however certain establishments such as restaurants may still use the old method of signing.
Many people now use a prepaid FairFX or Caxton card. Theses offer good exchange rates, are safe and money is protected if the card gets lost or stolen. These are accepted in Moroccan ATMs anywhere you see the MasterCard logo and in some shops too.
ATMs can now be found in abundance in most towns and accept Visa, Maestro, Cirrus etc but these will usually incur charges of around 5%. You should check with your bank as charges for using ATMs abroad may make exchanging cash a better option. 
Popular destinations such as Tangier, Marrakech, Agadir etc have ATM's in large tourist international hotels as well as on all main roads. The medina of Marrakech has in excess of 20 ATMs.
Using a credit card (VISA etc) to obtain money from ATM's is also possible but one must remember that interest is charged from the moment money is dispensed. The normal practice of an interest-free period which applies to purchases, typically over 50 days, made on the card does NOT apply to cash withdrawals. Banks will allow cheques to be cashed but must be supported by a guarantee card.
Along with the major souk adjacent to the Djemaa El-Fna, there are a plethora of smaller souks throughout the city where any number of products can be bargained for. Keep an eye out for a wide array of hand-crafted candle-holding lanterns, as well as spectacular displays of local spices.
Argan oil, produced only in Morocco, is used in Moroccan cooking and beauty treatments. If you enjoy its unique nutty flavor, be sure to pick some up in the souks. It will cost you about Dh 70 at local supermarket for cooking oil or Dh 200 for genuine cosmetic oil.
Marrakech is home to a large tanning industry, and leather goods of high quality can be bought here cheaply. Check out camel leather items especially - jackets, round poufs, and handbags.
For the shoes always check they have no paper inside the plate (sole in french) because it is very common, don't be fooled by demonstration of how they bend the shoe and turns back to the position try it yourself by feeling and hearing how the paper bends. For poor quality one you shouldn't pay more than Dh 40 and for a good one no more than Dh 90, shop around and learn the difference between the quality.
Also of interest would be items made of the local cactus silk, which is really rayon, a natural fiber made of plant cellulose and produced in Morocco. Rayon holds the chemical dyes well which accounts for the vibrant range of true colors (natural dyes cannot produce a "true" color). On offer are scarves, handbags, tablecloths, bedspreads and throws in stunning colors. Some merchants try to charge a premium price for this "cactus silk". Check well because there are many fakes and sellers will usually tell you any lie to get you pay a high price.
Be sure to wander round the potters' souk, and look for brightly colored platters and bowls, as well as tagines in all sizes
Lovely cashmere shawls can also be had for less than a fiver with a little bargaining.
If you cannot stand the bargaining, there are two government run shops where you can buy handicrafts at fixed prices. Look for boutique d'artisans. One is near Djemaa El-Fna while the other one is in the ville nouvelle.
An option to explore the souks in a more tranquil way is to go during the Friday prayer. Although some shops will be closed, most stay open and are significantly less crowded than at other times.
As a guide for prices, maximum and generous prices you should pay.
Don't bid for a price that you are not willing to pay.
Even hostel prices can be haggled.
Remember, sellers are just the middle man, they don't produce it, except maybe for some kinds of lamps, and they pay very little to the people who actually make it. Please also NEVER pay in advance. And NEVER let anyone write you an invoice. Its a bad idea and in most of the cases you will never see your goods or money back.
Each night in the Djemaa El-Fna rows of street stalls are set up under giant white tents. These huts serve similar fare and have menus printed in French, Arabic and usually English. Everyone has tajine, couscous, brochette and some variety of soups. Some have specialities like offal, egg sandwiches or special tajines. Be aware that most restaurants employ rather insistent "greeters," who are very aggressive in trying to customers for their stall. The line 'we already ate' seems to work well to get them to stop.
Vegetarians will find that there are few options outside the ubiquitous Tagine avec Legumes.
For more upscale eateries (and especially for non-Moroccan cuisine) you generally must go outside the Medina to Ville Nouvelle. However, <b>Diaffa</b> (Rue Jbel El Akhdar just off Av. Mohammed V, across from Club Med), is an upscale restaurant in one of the oldest buildings in the Medina, and offers excellent Moroccan cuisine in an ambiance that recalls the Orient at the height of its magic and glory. The food, building (whether the tables around the central courtyard and fountain or the second-level balcony), and tactful and tasteful entertainment are all not to be missed.
If you want to eat well in Marrakech, do what the locals do and eat at the food stalls in the square. It is a common misconception that these stalls are here for the tourists. Actually, they have been in existence long before Marrakech became a tourist destination. All of the stalls can be regarded as perfectly safe to eat at. They are strictly licensed and controlled by the government, especially now as it is a popular destination for tourists.
Some tips:
Street vendors offer <b>fresh orange juice</b> (<i>jus d'Orange</i>) by the glass for Dh 4. Try it with a dash of salt like the locals, but be wary of vendors who try and water the juice down with tap water. Also, pay attention when you buy as they offer 2 types of orange...the blood orange juice costs Dh 10 per glass and a misunderstanding on what you want to drink could occur.
Confirm the price of your orange juice and pay for it <b>before</b> you drink. Unscrupulous vendors will sometimes try to charge you Dh 10 for a Dh 4 glass of <i>jus d'Orange</i>, so don't accept your drink until you've paid the correct amount.
Be wary also, that they do not always clean the glasses very well so it is possible to get an upset stomach from the juice. However, many vendors will give you the juice in a plastic cup instead of glass for 1 Dh extra.
There is a very limited selection of places selling alcohol in the medina.
Outside Medina.
Marrakech has an amazing choice of places to stay ranging from tented camps outside Marrakech to cheap hostels and hotels that can be charming or seedy to luxurious kasbahs in luxurious gardens or the traditional riad (garden courtyard) hotels. Wherever you choose ( or can afford) to stay it really is a must to visit one of the riad hotels to see this amazing style of architecture. Most riad managers will be happy to show you around provided that they are not too busy and in some riads you can even book a lunch or dinner without being a resident provided that the riad is not privately rented. For example see Riad Cinnamon, Riad Laksiba and Riad Papillon.
There are three main zones to sleep: Medina, GuÃ©liz (also known as Ville Nouvelle), and the surroundings of the city. The Medina has the highest concentration of very cheap <i>hotels</i> and <i>riads</i> (small palaces), while GuÃ©liz is much more quiet and most of the hotels are mid price (including showers in the room, breakfast service), but going to the medina from the GuÃ©liz by taxi costs about Dh 10-15 and can take a long time at busy periods (evenings and weekends).
The surroundings have all the huge tourist hotels, the ones that usually come with what the travel agencies offer. They can be further away from the medina and the rest of the city, but have big swimming pools, restaurants, and many services.
The Medina is packed with Riads and Dars (old grand houses converted into hotels and inns). <b>Riads</b> should have gardens; with smaller <b>Dars</b> having open courtyards. However the term Riad is used very loosly today to describe a house with an internal open-air center. These are wonderful places to stay to get a feel for life in Marrakech.
If you arrive by car, ask the hosts to help you find your way from the parking lot, especially if you never experienced orientation in a real medina before. Here are a sample of some of the riads (in alphabetical order) where you can experience Marrakech's unique style of living:
The budget conscious will have more luck in the streets and alleyways south of Djemaa El-Fna, which are packed with discount hotels offering singles from Dh 50. Derb Sidi Bouloukat is a good place to look, a quiet but safe alleyway packed with traditional-style hotels just a min from Djemaa El-Fna. Its entrance is easy to find, just a few steps away from Djemaa El-Fna. Take Riad Zatoune (unmarked) which starts right of the Moroccan Red Crescent (with your back towards the Koutoubia) and it's the first alley on the right (marked in Arabic only). On your way in Riad Zitoune you will also come across the public hammam (Dh 10, left entrance for women, right entrance for men, the soap, glove and small bucket can be bought at many shops across the street) and a small restaurant serving bissara and mint tea for less than Dh 5.
Popular options with backpackers include:
In the little streets between rue Bab Agnaou and rue Riad Zitoune (where the Smara, the Essaouira, and the Imouzzer are) there are a lot of other small hostels. It is difficult to get lost as they are surrounded by these two big streets and Djemaa El-Fna. It could be a good idea to arrive during the day (best in the morning) and wander around comparing many hostels in a short time.
The 5 star hotel Tigmiza Suites &amp; Pavillons has 13 suites, a spa named "color mint spa water", a gourmet restaurant ...
Marrakech is a generally safe city, with a solid police presence. However, staying alert about your surroundings and taking general safety precautions is always a good idea like everywhere. Here are some tips:
The tap water in Marrakech is OK for bathing. While locals drink it with no problems, visitors often find it hard to digest. To be safe, opt for bottled mineral water, available at the numerous marketplace kiosks and food stalls. Make sure that the cap seal has not been broken, since Moroccan vendors have been known to save money by refilling plastic bottles from the tap. At restaurants, ask for your drinks without ice cubes, which are usually made with tap water.
An important issue concerning toiletries in Marrakesh, and the cities around as well, is that, in general, comercial establishments, cafÃ©s and restaurants also, do not have toilet paper on their bathrooms, even on ladies's rooms. So a good practice is always to carry toilet paper with you.
If you look like a tourist, then it is common for people to offer to help with directions or even lead you to what you are looking for. Although not apparent at first, these people expect to be paid and will often lead you round in circles to increase the amount. Be careful when exiting your taxi, scammers may grab your luggage from the trunk while posing as bellboys from the hotel, so confirm their identity before letting anyone touch your bags. Also, people may say that the place you are looking for is closed, but they will take you somewhere else that's better. This is almost always a lie. The best people to ask for directions are people behind a counter, as they cannot lead you because they don't want to leave their stall. If you are seriously lost, getting someone to lead you back is an option, but you should not give them more than Dh 10-20, no matter how much they complain.
Moroccans are not permitted to be guides for foreigners without a license. Usually Police officers (under cover) are patrolling to catch Moroccans who are bothering tourists or try to make some money.
There are often people in Djemaa El-Fna offering <b>henna tattoos</b>, which are popular with locals and tourists alike. But among the many genuine traders are one or two scam artists. They appear very charming and trustworthy while you choose a design, but will then cleverly divert your attention. Before you know it, you have the beginnings of a rather poor henna tattoo. Even if you do not want a design, be sure to keep your hands away from them as they will grab your hand and begin a design anyway. The scam artist later demands massive payments, in whatever currency you have (dirhams or not). After emptying your pockets, if they consider you can afford more, they will demand that you visit a nearby ATM. Always agree on a firm price before work starts. If you can't do this, insist that the operator stops immediately - then go to another (hopefully more reliable) operator to get your design completed. If they say it is free before they start or while they are doing it, they will always ask for a price later on. If this happens to you, you can walk away without paying; however, they will harass you for a little before giving up and moving on to another tourist. Also, there have been stories of these scam artists using henna mixed with dangerous chemicals, such as PPD (this is sometimes done to make the tattoos appear black), which can cause skin damage or severe allergic reactions.
Some tourists encounter an elderly lady offering henna in the main square - she welcomes you to her stall, and then fetches her friends (who arrive, usually, on motor bikes) and will provide you with very appealing tatoos - however, beware - they will not agree a price upfront and will ask for huge amounts - e.g. a 50Dh tatoo will be 450Dh - or they will promise you free tattoos and then charge equally large amounts. When you dispute the amount they will scream at you - so be calm, pay them what you think it is worth, and walk away. If they try to stop you then create attention - however, do not use physical violence as these artists work in gangs and before you know it you'll be surrounded by other con-artists.
There is a small nameless restaurant inside the markets catering to tourists.  It looks like a budget restaurant but has extremely inflated prices.  It has an awning with painted faces and offers grilled brochettes for Dh 40 each, which is much higher than the regular price.
Most Moroccans are tourist-friendly and are not aggressive, so sometimes making a fuss in public can generate unwanted attention for a scam artist and shame them into backing off.
By registering in person or online, citizens can make it easier for their country's embassy to contact them in case of emergency. Be sure to report any crime to both the local police and your embassy.
Most other foreign embassies and consulates in Morocco are in Rabat, with a few more in Casablanca.
There are many dry cleaning shops inside and outside of the Medina. It takes only one day to clean and will cost from Dh10-30 per piece. If you stay at hotel, you can hand out your dirty clothes to a housekeeper. Usually they wash it by hand. They do not have a price list and usually say "up to you". You should not pay more than Dh 50-100 per plastic bag.
