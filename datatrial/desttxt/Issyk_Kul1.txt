<b>Issyk Kul</b> (<a href="/en/Kyrgyz" title="Kyrgyz" class="mw-redirect">Kyrgyz</a>: Ð«ÑÑÐº ÐºÓ©Ð» <i>Ysyk KÃ¶l</i>, <a href="/en/Russian" title="Russian" class="mw-redirect">Russian</a>: ÐÑÑÑÐº-ÐÑÐ»Ñ) is a lake in <a href="/en/Kyrgyzstan" title="Kyrgyzstan">Kyrgyzstan</a>. The name refers both to the lake and the <i>oblast</i> (region) containing the lake.  The region is centered around the massive Issyk Kul lake, which is the second largest alpine lake in the world.  It is completely ringed by the massive snow-capped <a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Tian_Shan&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Tian Shan (page does not exist)">Tian Shan</a> mountains that lie between 3000 and 4000 meters.
The Issyk Kul lake reaches to 663 meters deep in the center. The east end of the lake was also once used as a torpedo testing site by the Soviet Navy, making the region off limits to foreigners for a period of time.
<br />
Issyk Kul is divided between the more populated and touristy North Shore and the more rugged and less populated South Shore.

Issyk Kul is a slightly saline deep water body.  Years of over-fishing have decimated its fisheries and many of the smoked fish sold in the surronding cities come from other alpine lakes.  Due to a lack of reasonable control on tourism, many sub-standard and unfinished low quality tourism resorts ring the lake's north shore.  Nevertheless, there still remain numerous places to appreciate the true beauty of Issyk Kul.
A mountain pass road being constructed between Issyk Kul and Almaty, Kazakhstan is set to increase the number of tourists in the coming years and without government controls on development, exposing the lake to more tourists will only deplete its natural beauty.
<a href="/en/Russian" title="Russian" class="mw-redirect">Russian</a> and <a href="/en/Kyrgyz" title="Kyrgyz" class="mw-redirect">Kyrgyz</a> are the primary languages.  Some hospitality staff may speak English, but it is much more helpful to know basic Russian.

The locally published <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.thespektator.co.uk/issue_5.html">Spektator</a> magazine has an online guide to circumnavigating Issyk Kul.
There are many routes for <b>hiking</b> into the mountains surrounding the lake.  Issyk Kul is also ringed by hundreds of kilometers of beaches popular for swimming and sunning.
<br />
Most of the restaurants serve "national and European" cuisine, which amounts to local and Russian food.  There are few restaurants catering to western tastes.  Most locals pack their own food and prepare in their hotel rooms and on the beach.  You can find numerous shashlik stands in the summer serving marinated grilled lamb and beef.
<br />
Some locals believe drinking the slightly saline water of Issyk Kul has health benefits.  But, there is a uranium tailing pond on the south shore, that likely runs off into the lake.
There are no lifeguards at any of the beaches.
There are no nudist beaches and women being topless is quite rare, but local custom has no aversion to extremely skimpy swimsuits.
Beware, as the lake sits at 1600 meters above sea level, a few days in the sun can do more damage to your skin than a week at sea level.
