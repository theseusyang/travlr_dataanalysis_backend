<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.yoursingapore.com/"><b>Singapore</b></a> (æ°å å¡) is a city-state in <a href="/en/Southeast_Asia" title="Southeast Asia">Southeast Asia</a>. Founded as a British trading colony in 1819, since independence it has become one of the world's most prosperous countries and boasts the world's busiest port.
Combining the skyscrapers and subways of a modern, affluent city with a medley of Chinese, Malay and Indian influences and a tropical climate, with tasty food, good shopping and a vibrant night-life scene, this Garden City makes a great stopover or springboard into the region.
Singapore is a small country on a small island, but with just over five million people it is a fairly crowded city and in fact second only to <a href="/en/Monaco" title="Monaco">Monaco</a> as the world's most densely populated country.
However, unlike many other densely populated countries, Singapore - with more than 50% of its area covered by greenery and with over 50 major parks and 4 nature reserves - is an enchanting garden city.
Large self-contained residential towns mushroomed all over the island, around the clean and modern city centre.
The centre of the city is located in the south &#8212; consisting roughly of the Orchard Road shopping area, the Riverside, the new Marina Bay area and also the skyscraper-filled Shenton way financial district known, in acronym-loving Singapore, as the <b>CBD</b> (Central Business District).
In the centre, Singapore's addressing system is fairly similar to Western countries (such as 17 Orchard Road), but the new housing developments on the outskirts may appear more intimidating: a typical address might be "Blk 505 Jurong West St 51 #01-186".  Here, "Blk 505" is the housing block number (Blk = Block), "Jurong West" is the area, while "St 51" is the street name/number, and "#01-186" means floor 1 unit number 186, stall or shop 186.  The first digit of both housing block and street number is the neighbourhood's number (in this case 5), making it easier to narrow down the right location.  There are also 6-digit postal codes, which, considering the small size of the island, generally correspond to exactly one building. For example, "Blk 9 Bedok South Ave 2" is "Singapore 460009".  Finally, you will also encounter Malay terms in addresses: the most common are <b>Jalan</b> (<i>Jln</i>) for "Road", <b>Lorong</b> (<i>Lor</i>) for "Lane", <b>Bukit</b> (<i>Bt</i>) for "Hill" and <b>Kampong</b> (<i>Kg</i>) for "Village".

Singapore is a microcosm of Asia, populated by Chinese, Malays, Indians, and a large group of workers and expatriates from all across the globe.
Singapore has a partly deserved reputation for sterile predictability that has earned it descriptions like William Gibson's "Disneyland with the death penalty" or the "world's only shopping mall with a seat in the United Nations".  Nevertheless, the Switzerland of Asia is for many a welcome respite from the poverty, dirt, chaos, and crime of much of the Southeast Asian mainland, and if you scratch below the squeaky clean surface and get away from the tourist trail you'll soon find more than meets the eye.
Singaporean <b>food</b> is legendary, with bustling hawker centres and 24-hour coffee shops offering cheap food from all parts of Asia, and shoppers can bust their baggage allowances in <b>shopping</b> centres like Orchard Road and Suntec City. In recent years some societal restrictions have also loosened up, and now you can bungee jump and dance on bar tops all night long, although alcohol is still very pricey and chewing gum can only be bought from a pharmacy for medical use.
Two <b>casino complexes</b> &#8212; or "Integrated Resorts", to use the Singaporean euphemism &#8212; opened in 2010 in <a href="/en/Singapore/Sentosa" title="Singapore/Sentosa">Sentosa</a> and <a href="/en/Singapore/Marina_Bay" title="Singapore/Marina Bay">Marina Bay</a> as part of Singapore's new <b>Fun and Entertainment</b> drive, the aim being to double the number of tourists visiting and increase the length of time they stay within the country.  Watch out for more loosening up in the future.
The first records of Singapore date back to the second and third centuries where a vague reference to its location was found in Greek and Chinese texts, under the names of Sabana and Pu Luo Chung respectively.
According to legend, <a href="/en/Sumatra" title="Sumatra">Srivijayan</a> prince Sang Nila Utama landed on the island and, catching sight of a strange creature that he thought was a lion, decided to found a new city he called <i>Singapura</i>, Sanskrit for <b>Lion City</b>, c. 1299.  Alas, there have never been any lions anywhere near Singapore (until the Singapore Zoo opened) or elsewhere on Malaya in historical times, so the mysterious beast was more probably a tiger or wild boar.
More historical records indicate that the island was settled at least two centuries earlier and was known as <b>Temasek</b>, Javanese for "Sea Town", and an important port for the <a href="/en/Sumatra" title="Sumatra">Sumatran</a> Srivijaya kingdom. However, Srivijaya fell around 1400 and Temasek, battered by the feuding kingdoms of <a href="/en/Thailand" title="Thailand">Siam</a> and the <a href="/en/Java" title="Java">Javanese</a> Majapahit, fell into obscurity.
As Singapura, it then briefly regained importance as a trading centre for the Melaka Sultanate and later, the Johor Sultanate. However, Portuguese raiders then destroyed the settlement and Singapura faded into obscurity once more.
The story of Singapore as we know it today began in 1819, when <b>Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles</b> made a deal with a claimant to the throne of the Sultanate of <a href="/en/Johor" title="Johor">Johor</a>: the British would support his claim in exchange for the right to set up a trading post on the island.
Though the Dutch initially protested, the signing of the Anglo-Dutch treaty in 1824, which separated the Malay world into British and Dutch spheres of influence (resulting in the current <a href="/en/Malaysia" title="Malaysia">Malaysia</a>-<a href="/en/Indonesia" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a> and Singapore-Indonesia borders), ended the conflict. The Dutch renounced their claim to Singapore and ceded their colony in <a href="/en/Malacca" title="Malacca">Malacca</a> to the British, in exchange for the British ceding their colonies on <a href="/en/Sumatra" title="Sumatra">Sumatra</a> to the Dutch.
Well-placed at the entrance to the Straits of Malacca, straddling the trade routes between China, India, Europe, and Australia, Raffles' master stroke was to declare Singapore a <b>free port</b>, with no duties charged on trade. As traders flocked to escape onerous Dutch taxes, the trading post soon grew into one of Asia's busiest, drawing people from far and wide.  Along with <a href="/en/Penang" title="Penang">Penang</a> and <a href="/en/Malacca" title="Malacca">Malacca</a>, Singapore became one of the <b>Straits Settlements</b> and a jewel in the British colonial crown. Its economic fortunes received a further boost when palm oil and rubber from neighbouring Malaya were processed and shipped out via Singapore.
In 1867, Singapore was formally split off from British India and made into a directly ruled Crown Colony.
When World War II broke out, <b>Fortress Singapore</b> was seen as a formidable British base, with massive naval fortifications guarding against assault by sea. However, not only did the fortress lack a fleet, as all ships were tied up defending Britain from the Germans, but the Japanese wisely chose to cross Malaya by bicycle instead!
Despite hastily turning the guns around, this was something the unimaginative British ruling class had not prepared for at all, and on 15 Feb 1942, with supplies critically low after less than a week of fighting, Singapore's colonial masters ignominiously surrendered. The colony's erstwhile rulers were packed off to Changi Prison. Tens of thousands perished in the subsequent brutal Japanese occupation. The return of the British in 1945 was triumphalist.
Granted self-rule in 1955, Singapore briefly joined the <a href="/en/Malaysia" title="Malaysia">Malaysian</a> Federation in 1963 when the British left, but was expelled because the Chinese-majority city was seen as a threat to Malay dominance. The island became independent on 9 August 1965, thus becoming the only country to gain independence against its own will in the history of the modern world!
The subsequent forty years rule by Prime Minister <b>Lee Kuan Yew</b> saw Singapore's economy boom, with the country rapidly becoming one of the wealthiest and most developed in Asia despite its lack of natural resources, earning it a place as one of the four <b>East Asian Tigers</b>. Now led by Lee's son <b>Lee Hsien Loong</b>, the ruling <b>People's Action Party</b> (PAP) continues to dominate the political scene with 81 out of 87 seats in Parliament. Societal restrictions have been loosened up in recent years though, with the government trying to shake off its staid image, and it remains to be seen how the delicate balancing act between political control and social freedom will play out.
Singapore prides itself on being a multi-racial country, and has a diverse culture despite its small size. The largest group are the Chinese, who form about 75% of the population. One quarter of Singapore residents are foreigners.
Amongst the Chinese, Hokkien, Teochew and Cantonese speakers are the largest subgroups, with Mandarin acting as the <i>lingua franca</i> of the community. Other notable "dialect" groups among the Chinese include the Hakkas, Hainanese and Foochows.
Malays, who are comprised of descendants of Singapore's original inhabitants as well as migrants from present day Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei, form about 14% of the population.
Indians form about 9% of the population. Among the Indians, Tamils form the largest group by far, though there are also a significant numbers of speakers of other Indian languages such as Hindi, Malayalam and Punjabi.
The remainder are a mix of many other cultures, most notably the Eurasians who are of mixed European and Asian descent, and also a handful of Burmese, Japanese, Thais and many others.  Slightly over one-third of Singapore's residents are not citizens.
There are a large number of Filipinos, many of them working as domestic helpers. Throngs of these happily smiling and chattering Filipinas may be seen in public spaces - especially on Sundays when they take their only day off.
Singapore is also religiously diverse, with no religious group forming a majority. Religious freedom is guaranteed by the constitution of Singapore. Buddhism is the largest religion with about 33% of the population declaring themselves Buddhist. Other religions which exist in significant numbers include Christianity, Islam, Hinduism and Taoism. In addition to the "big five", there are also much smaller numbers of Sikhs, Zoroastrians, Jews, Baha'is and Jains. Some 17% of Singaporeans profess to have no religious affiliation.
As Singapore is located a mere 1.5 degrees north of the Equator, its weather is usually sunny with no distinct seasons. Rain falls almost daily throughout the year, usually in sudden, heavy showers that rarely last longer than an hour. However, most rainfall occurs during the north east monsoon (November to January), occasionally featuring lengthy spells of continuous rain. Spectacular thunderstorms can occur throughout the year, any time during the day, so it's wise to carry an umbrella at all times, both as a shade from the sun or cover from the rain.
Between May and October, forest fires in neighbouring <a href="/en/Sumatra" title="Sumatra">Sumatra</a> can also cause dense haze, although this is unpredictable and comes and goes rapidly: check the National Environment Agency's site <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://app.nea.gov.sg/psi/">[1]</a> for current data.
The temperature averages around:
The high temperature and humidity, combined with the lack of wind and the fact that temperatures stay high during the night, can take its toll on visitors from colder parts of the world. Bear in mind that spending more than about one hour outdoors can be very exhausting, especially if combined with moderate exercise. Singaporeans themselves shun the heat, and for a good reason. Many live in air-conditioned flats, work in air-conditioned offices, take the air-conditioned metro to air-conditioned shopping malls connected to each other by underground tunnels where they shop, eat, and exercise in air-conditioned fitness clubs. Follow their example if you want to avoid discomfort in the searing heat and humidity of Singapore.
<b><i>Gong xi fa cai</i> Singapore style</b><br />
There are a few twists to the Singapore way of celebrating Chinese New Year, particularly the <b>food</b>, which bears little resemblance to the steamy hotpots of frigid northern China.  The top dish is <i>bak kwa</i> (èå¹²), sweet barbecued pork, followed closely by <i>yu sheng</i> (é­ç), a salad of shredded vegetables and raw fish enthusiastically tossed into the air by all present.  Favorite desserts are crumbly sweet pineapple tarts and gooey steamed <i>nian gao</i> (å¹´ç³) cakes.  Red packets of money (çº¢å <i>ang pow</i>) are still handed out generously, but unlike in China, in Singapore you only need to start paying up once married.
Singapore is a secular city state but due to its multicultural population, Singapore celebrates Chinese, Buddhist, Hindu, Muslim, Indian, and Christian holidays.
The year kicks off with a bang on January 1st and <b>New Year</b>, celebrated in Singapore just as in the West with a fireworks show and parties at every nightspot in town. Particularly famous are the wet and wild <b>foam parties</b> on the beaches of resort island <a href="/en/Singapore/Sentosa" title="Singapore/Sentosa">Sentosa</a> &#8212; at least those years when the authorities deign to permit such relative debauchery.
<br />
<b>Chinese New Year dates</b><br />
2012 is the year of the Dragon
Due to the influence of the Chinese majority, the largest event by far is <b>Chinese New Year</b> (ååæ°å¹´) or, more politically correctly, <b>Lunar New Year</b>, usually held in February. While this might seem to be an ideal time to visit, many smaller shops and eateries close for 2-3 days during the period, though supermarkets, department stores and high end restaurants remain open. The whole festival stretches out for no less than 42 days, but the frenzied buildup to the peak occurs just before the night of the new moon, with exhortations of <i>gong xi fa cai</i> (æ­ååè´¢ "congratulations and prosper"), red tinsel, mandarin oranges and the year's zodiac animal emblazoned everywhere and crowds of shoppers queuing in <a href="/en/Singapore/Chinatown" title="Singapore/Chinatown">Chinatown</a>, where there are also extensive street decorations to add spice to the festive mood. The two following days are spent with family and most of the island comes to a standstill, and then life returns to normal... except for the final burst of <b>Chingay</b>, a colourful parade down Orchard Road held ten days later.
On the fifth day of the fifth month of the Chinese calendar, the <b>Dragon Boat Festival</b> (ç«¯åè) is celebrated to commemorate a Chinese folk hero. As part of the celebrations, rice dumplings, which in Singapore are sometimes wrapped in pandan leaves instead of the original bamboo leaves, are usually eaten. In addition, dragon boat races are often held at the Singapore River on this day. The seventh month of the Chinese lunar calendar &#8212; usually August &#8212; starts off with a puff of smoke, as "hell money" is burned and food offerings are made to please the spirits of ancestors who are said to return to earth at this time. The climax on the 15th day of the lunar calendar is the <b>Hungry Ghost Festival</b> (ä¸­åè), when the living get together to stuff themselves and watch plays and Chinese opera performances. Following soon afterwards, the <b>Mid-Autumn Festival</b> (ä¸­ç§è) on the 15th day of the 8th lunar month (Sep/Oct) is also a major event, with elaborate lantern decorations &#8212; particularly in Jurong's <a href="/en/Singapore/North_and_West" title="Singapore/North and West">Chinese Garden</a> &#8212; and <b>moon cakes</b> filled with red bean paste, nuts, and more consumed merrily.
The Hindu festival of lights, Diwali, known locally as <b>Deepavali</b>, is celebrated around October or November and <a href="/en/Singapore/Little_India" title="Singapore/Little India">Little India</a> is brightly decorated for the occasion. At around January-February, one may witness the celebration of <b>Thaipusam</b>, a Tamil Hindu festival in which male devotees would carry a <i>kavadi</i>, an elaborate structure which pierces through various parts of his body, and join a procession from the Sri Srinivasa Perumal Temple in Little India to the Sri Thandayuthapani Temple in Tank Road. Female devotees usually join the procession carrying pots of milk instead. About one week before Deepavali is <b>Thimithi</b>, the fire-walking festival where one can see male devotees walking on burning coals at the Sri Mariamman Temple in Chinatown.
The Islamic month of Ramadan and Eid-ul-Fitr or <b>Hari Raya Puasa</b> as it is called here, is a major occasion in Malay parts of town,  particularly Geylang Serai on the <a href="/en/Singapore/East_Coast" title="Singapore/East Coast">East Coast</a>, which is lighted up with extensive decorations during the period. Another festival celebrated by the Malays is Eid-ul-Adha, known locally as <b>Hari Raya Haji</b>, which is the period when Muslims make the trip to Mecca to perform in Hajj. In local mosques, lambs contributed by the faithful are sacrificed and their meat is used to feed the poor.
The Buddhist <b>Vesak Day</b>, celebrating the birthday of the Buddha Sakyamuni, plus the Christian holidays of <b>Christmas Day</b>, for which Orchard road is extensively decorated, and <b>Good Friday</b> round out the list of holidays.
A more secular celebration occurs on August 9th, <b>National Day</b>, when fluttering flags fill Singapore and spectacular National Day parades are held to celebrate independence.
Singapore holds <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://singapore.travelxem.com/culture-heritage/festivals-events/">numerous events each year</a>. Some of its famous festivals and events include the <b>Singapore Food Festival</b>, the <b>Singapore Grand Prix</b>, the <b>Singapore Arts Festival</b>, the <b>Chingay Parade</b>, the <b>World Gourmet Summit</b> and <b>ZoukOut</b>.
The <b>Singapore Sun Festival</b> is another popular festival in Singapore,  with 2010's line-up featuring renowned stars such as David Foster, Natalie Cole, Jose Carreras and Sharon Stone. <b>Christmas</b> is also widely celebrated in Singapore, a season where the city streets and shopping malls along its famous shopping belt Orchard Road are lit up and decorated in vibrant colours. In addition, the <b>Singapore Jewel Festival</b> attracts numerous tourists every year, and is a display of precious gems, famous jewels and masterpieces from international jewellers and designers.
<b>Banned in Singapore:</b><br />
There's more to the list than just porn and drugs:
Most nationalities can enter Singapore without a visa.  Refer to the <b>Immigration and Checkpoints Authority</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.ica.gov.sg/">[2]</a> for current guidelines, including a list of the 30+ nationalities that are required to obtain a visa in advance. Entry permit duration depends on nationality and entry point: most people get 14 or 30 days, although EU, Norwegian, Swiss and US passport holders get 90 days. Citizens of some CIS countries (eg: Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan) can transit 4 days without a visa, if they have tickets to a third country.
Singapore has <b>very strict drug laws</b>, and <b>drug trafficking carries a mandatory death penalty</b> &#8212; which is applied to everyone, including foreigners. Even if you technically haven't entered Singapore and are merely transiting (eg. changing flights without the need to clear passport control and customs) while in possession of drugs, you would still be <i><b>hanged by the neck until dead</b></i> on the next Friday after your sentencing (unless sentenced or your appeal against sentence refused on a Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday or if you are a foreigner when your consulate is given at least 7 days notice ). The paranoid might also like to note that in Singapore, it is an offence even to have any drug metabolites in your system, even if they were consumed outside Singapore, and Customs occasionally does spot urine tests at the airport!  In addition, bringing in explosives or firearms without a permit is also a capital offence in Singapore.
Bring prescriptions for any medicines you may have with you, and obtain prior permission from the Health Sciences Authority <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.hsa.gov.sg/publish/hsaportal/en/health_products_regulation/bringing_personal_medication.html">[3]</a> before bringing in any sedatives (eg. Valium/diazepam) or strong painkillers (eg. codeine).  Hippie types may expect a little extra attention from Customs, but getting a shave and a haircut is no longer a condition for entry.
Duty free allowances for alcohol are 1 L each of wine, beer and spirits, though the 1 L of spirits may be substituted with 1 L of wine or beer, unless you are entering from Malaysia. Travellers entering from Malaysia are not entitled to any duty free allowance. Alcohol may not be brought in by persons under the age of 18. There is <i>no</i> duty free allowance for <b>cigarettes</b>: all cigarettes legally sold in Singapore are stamped "SDPC", and smokers caught with unmarked cigarettes may be fined $500 per pack. (In practice, though, bringing in one opened pack is usually tolerated.) If you declare your cigarettes or excess booze at customs, you can opt to pay the tax or let the customs officers keep the cigarettes until your departure. The import of <b>chewing gum</b> is technically illegal, but in practice customs officers would usually not bother with a few sticks for personal consumption.
<b>Pornography</b>, <b>pirated goods</b> and publications by the <b>Jehovah's Witnesses</b> and the <b>Unification Church</b> may not be imported to Singapore, and baggage is scanned at air, land and sea entry points. In theory, all entertainment media including movies and video games must be sent to the Board of Censors for approval before they can be brought into Singapore, but that is rarely if ever enforced for original (non-pirated) goods. Pirated CDs or DVDs, on the other hand, can land you fines of up to $1000 per disc.
Singapore is one of Southeast Asia's largest aviation hubs, so unless you're coming from <a href="/en/Peninsular_Malaysia" title="Peninsular Malaysia" class="mw-redirect">Peninsular Malaysia</a> or <a href="/en/Batam" title="Batam">Batam</a>/<a href="/en/Bintan" title="Bintan">Bintan</a> in Indonesia, the easiest way to enter Singapore is by air. In addition to flag-carrier <a href="/en/Singapore_Airlines" title="Singapore Airlines">Singapore Airlines</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.singaporeair.com">[4]</a> and its regional subsidiary <b>SilkAir</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.silkair.com">[5]</a>, Singapore is also home to low-cost carriers <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.tigerairways.com">Tiger Airways</a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.jetstar.com">'Jetstar Asia</a> and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.flyscoot.com">Scoot</a>.
In addition to the locals, every carrier of any size in Asia offers flights to Singapore, with pan-Asian discount carrier <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.airasia.com">AirAsia</a> and Malaysian regional operator <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.fireflyz.com.my">Firefly</a> operating dense networks from Singapore.  There are also direct services to Europe, the Middle East, Australia, New Zealand, North America, and even South Africa. Singapore is particularly popular on the "Kangaroo Route" between Australia and Europe, with airlines like <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.britishairways.com">British Airways</a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.etihad.com">Etihad Airways</a> and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.emirates.com/">Emirates</a> using Singapore as the stopover point.
As befits the country's main airport, major regional hub status, <b>Changi Airport</b> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IATA" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:IATA">IATA</a>: <b>SIN</b>;  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICAO" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:ICAO">ICAO</a>: <b>WSSS</b>) <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.changiairport.com/changi/en/index.html">[6]</a> and officially the 'best airport in the world' (see Skytrax (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IATA" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:IATA">IATA</a>: <b>SIN</b>;  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICAO" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:ICAO">ICAO</a>: <b>WSSS</b>) <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.airlinequality.com">[7]</a>) is big, pleasant, and well organized, and immigration and baggage distribution is remarkably fast. The airport is split into three main terminals (T1, T2 and T3).
Figuring out which terminal your flight arrives in or departs from can be complicated: for example, Singapore Airlines uses both T2 and T3, and only announces the arrival terminal two hours before landing.  Fortunately transfers are quite easy, as the three main terminals are connected with the free Skytrain service, which can be used without passing through immigration.  Terminal 1 is physically connected to Terminals 2 and 3. By walking that you will not notice you're in a different terminal except by reading the signs. Your departing terminal is more straightforward as Singapore Airlines designates T2 as departures for destinations in South East Asia, the Indian subcontinent, the Middle East and Africa while all other destinations will use T3.  When you return to the airport and are leaving Singapore via Singapore Airlines, be sure to at least tell the driver your destination so he knows which terminal to take you to.
Unlike most other airports, there are no separate zones for departing and arriving passengers in the main terminals prior to passport control hence arriving passengers are free to shop and eat at the airside establishments if they are not in a hurry to meet someone or catch prearranged transportation.  In addition, if they have no luggage checked-in from their point of origin, they can clear passport control at any other terminal.
If you have over 5&#160;hr to spare there are <b>free city tours</b> five times a day departing from the airport. To register for any of the tours, simply approach the staff at the Free Singapore Tours (FST) Registration Booth located in:
Even if stuck in the airport, there are plenty of ways to kill time, as each terminal has a unique design and the airside areas of T1, T2, and T3 are attractions in themselves. T2, arguably the most interesting, has an indoor garden, a music listening area with couches and mood lighting, a computer gaming room, a small movie theatre, paid massage services, and of course plenty of duty-free shops. T3, the newest, has a butterfly garden and plenty of natural light, but fewer entertainment options. T1 has a swimming pool for $13.91 and jacuzzi, both open until 23:00. You can travel between the main terminals without passing through immigration and, if you have no checked-in luggage to collect, you can clear passport control and customs at any terminal.
In all terminals, <b>internet access</b> is provided free of charge, both wirelessly and via some 200 terminals and kiosks, there are some Xbox systems set up to keep gamers entertained, and there's live lounge music at times.  There are also SingTel and Starhub payphones that offer unlimited free local calls. ATMs abound and money changers offer reasonable rates as well, although you pay a small premium compared to the city. Food options are varied and generally reasonably priced, with some choice picks including the Peranakan-themed <b>Soup Restaurant</b> (T2 landside), which serves much more than just soup, and <b>Sakae Sushi</b> (T2 airside).  If you're up for a little adventure, seek out the staff canteen at level 3M of the car park next to T2, it's open to the public (with discounts for airport staff) and serves local food. It is relatively cheap compared to other food options in the airport but not exactly cheap compared to elsewhere in Singapore. There are also staff canteens in Terminals 1 and 3.
Terminals T1, T2 and T3 all have airside (ie accessible without passing through immigration) <b>transit hotels</b>. â +65 65419106 or book on-line via the <b>Ambassador Transit Hotel</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://athmg.com/">[8]</a> website. A 6&#160;hr "block" for a single/double/triple costs $73.56/82.39/110.35, budget singles (shared bathroom) $51.50, extensions $17.65 per hour. You can rent a shower (without a room) to freshen up for $8.40.  The <b>Plaza Premier Lounges</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.plaza-ppl.com">[9]</a> also offer a basic but functional gym with shower for $8.40 with a Singapore Airlines boarding pass.
From the airport there are a number of ways to get into the city:
<b>Seletar Airport</b> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IATA" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:IATA">IATA</a>: <b>XSP</b>;  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICAO" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:ICAO">ICAO</a>: <b>WSSL</b>), completed in 1928 and first used for civil aviation in 1930, is Singapore's first airport. While later airports like Kallang and Paya Lebar have been closed and turned into a military airbase respectively, Seletar is still in use to this day.
Currently, Seletar Airport is only used for general aviation, so if you're flying your own aircraft to Singapore, you'll most probably land here. The only practical means of access to Seletar is by taxi and trips from the airport incur a $3 surcharge.
Singapore is linked by two land crossings to Peninsular Malaysia:
The <b>Causeway</b> is a very popular and thus terminally congested entry point connecting Woodlands in the north of Singapore directly into the heart of <a href="/en/Johor_Bahru" title="Johor Bahru">Johor Bahru</a>. While congestion isn't as bad as it once was, the Causeway is still jam-packed on <b>Friday evenings</b> (towards Malaysia) and <b>Sunday evenings</b> (towards Singapore). The Causeway can be crossed by bus, train, taxi or car, but it is no longer feasible to cross on foot after Malaysia shifted their customs and immigration complex 2 km inland.
A second crossing between Malaysia and Singapore, known as the <b>Second Link</b>, has been built between Tuas in western Singapore and Tanjung Kupang in the western part of <a href="/en/Johor" title="Johor">Johor</a> state. Much faster and less congested than the Causeway, it is used by some of the luxury bus services to <a href="/en/Kuala_Lumpur" title="Kuala Lumpur">Kuala Lumpur</a> and is strongly recommended if you have your own car. There is only one infrequent bus across the Second Link, and only Malaysian "limousine" taxis are allowed to cross it (and charge RM150 and up for the privilege). Walking across is also not allowed, not that there would be any practical means to continue the journey from either end if you did.
<b>Driving into Singapore</b> with a foreign-registered car is rather complicated and expensive; see the Land Transport Authority's <i>Driving Into &amp; Out of Singapore</i> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.lta.gov.sg/motoring_matters/index_motoring_guide.htm">[10]</a> guide for the administrative details.  <b>Peninsular Malaysia-registered cars</b> need to show that they have valid road tax and Malaysian insurance coverage. <b>Other foreign cars</b> need a Vehicle Registration Certificate, Customs Document (Carnet), Vehicle Insurance purchased from a Singapore-based insurance company and an International Circulation Permit.   All foreign registered cars and motorcycles can be driven in Singapore for a maximum of 10 days in each calendar year without paying Vehicle Entry Permit (VEP) fees, but after the 10 free days have been utilised, you will need to pay a VEP fee of up to $20/day.
Go through immigration first and get your passport stamped. Then follow the Red Lane to buy the AutoPass ($10) from the LTA office. At the parking area, an LTA officer will verify your car, road tax and insurance cover note and issue you a small chit of paper which you take to the LTA counter to buy your AutoPass and rent an In-vehicle Unit (IU) for road pricing charges (or opt to pay a flat $5/day fee instead).  Once that is done, proceed to customs where you will have to open the boot for inspection. After that, you are free to go anywhere in Singapore. Any VEP fees, road pricing charges and tolls will be deducted from your AutoPass when you exit Singapore. This is done by slotting the AutoPass into the reader at the immigration counter while you get your passport stamped.
<b>Driving into Malaysia</b> from Singapore is relatively uncomplicated, although small tolls are charged for both crossing and (for the Second Link) the adjoining expressway. In addition, <b>Singapore-registered vehicles</b> are required to have their fuel tanks at least 3/4 full before leaving Singapore. Do be sure to change some ringgit before crossing, as Singapore dollars are accepted only at the unfavourable rate of 1:1.  Moreover, be prepared for longer queues as Malaysia introduced a biometric system for foreigners wishing to enter that country (see <a href="/en/Malaysia" title="Malaysia">Malaysia</a> article).
In both directions, note that rental cars will frequently ban or charge extra for crossing the border.
<b>Direct to/from Malaysian destinations</b>
There are buses to/from <a href="/en/Kuala_Lumpur" title="Kuala Lumpur">Kuala Lumpur (KL)</a> and many other destinations in Malaysia through the Woodlands Checkpoint and the Second Link at Tuas.  Unfortunately, there is no central bus terminal and different companies leave from all over the city.  Major operators include:
Most other operators have banded together in two shared booking portals.  Many, but by no means all, use the Golden Mile Complex shopping mall near <a href="/en/Singapore/Bugis" title="Singapore/Bugis">Bugis</a> as their Singapore terminal.
<br />
In general, the more you pay, the faster and more comfortable your trip. More expensive buses leave on time, use the Second Link, and don't stop along the way; while the cheapest buses leave late if at all, use the perpetually jammed Causeway and make more stops. Book early for popular departure times like Friday and Sunday evening, Chinese New Year, etc, and factor in some extra time for congestion at the border.
An alternative to taking a direct "international bus" is to make the short hop to <a href="/en/Johor_Bahru" title="Johor Bahru">Johor Bahru</a> to catch domestic Malaysian long-distance express buses to various Malaysian destinations from the <a href="/en/Johor_Bahru" title="Johor Bahru">Larkin Bus Terminal</a>. Besides having more options, fares may also be lower because you will be paying in Malaysian ringgit rather than Singaporean dollars. The downside is the time-consuming hassle of first getting to Johor Bahru and then getting to Larkin terminal on the outskirts of town.
<b>To/from Johor Bahru</b>
The most popular options to get to/from <a href="/en/Johor_Bahru" title="Johor Bahru">Johor Bahru</a> are the buses listed in the table.  There's a pattern to the madness: Singaporean-operated buses (SBS, SMRT, SJE) can only stop at one destination in Malaysia, while the Malaysian-operated Causeway Link <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.handalindah.com.my/">[18]</a> buses can only stop at one destination in Singapore.  Terminals aside, all buses make two stops at Singapore immigration and at Malaysian immigration. At both immigration points, <i>you must disembark with all your luggage</i> and pass through passport control and customs, then board the next bus by showing your ticket.  Figure on one hour for the whole rigmarole from end to end, more during rush hour.
Singapore is the southern terminus of Malaysia's <b>Keretapi Tanah Melayu</b> (Malayan Railway or KTMB) <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.ktmb.com.my">[19]</a> network.  There are two day trains (the Ekspres Sinaran Pagi and Ekspres Rakyat) and a sleeper service (Ekspres Senandung Malam) daily from <a href="/en/Kuala_Lumpur" title="Kuala Lumpur">Kuala Lumpur</a>, and also a day train (the Lambaian Timur departing Singapore at 4:45AM) and sleeper (Ekspres Timuran departing at 6PM) daily along the "<a href="/en/Jungle_Railway" title="Jungle Railway">Jungle Railway</a>" between Singapore and <a href="/en/Gua_Musang" title="Gua Musang">Gua Musang</a> (Lambian Timur) or Tumpat (Ekspres Timuran), near <a href="/en/Kota_Bharu" title="Kota Bharu">Kota Bharu</a> in the <a href="/en/East_Coast_(Malaysia)" title="East Coast (Malaysia)">East Coast</a> of Malaysia. Trains are clean and fairly efficient, but slower than buses.  See <a href="/en/Malaysia#By_train" title="Malaysia">Malaysia#By train</a> for details about fares and travel classes.
KTMB tickets in Singapore will be charged in dollars, while those bought in Malaysia will be charged in ringgit <i>at a 1:1 rate</i>. A ticket which costs RM10 (2.32 Euros) in Malaysia will thus cost $10 (5.75 Euros) if bought in Singapore. There are three ways to avoid paying double:
The small colonial-era railway station in Tanjong Pagar at the southern edge of the CBD has closed down on 30 June 2011, and all KTMB trains now depart from the Woodlands Train Checkpoint near the Malaysian border. This means that immigration formalities go back to normal international practice - Singapore immigration followed by Malaysia immigration at Woodlands, then Malaysia stamps you in at Woodlands. In the reverse direction, Malaysian immigration checks are carried out on board the trains at Johor Bahru, and the train then heads for Woodlands where Singapore customs is located.
Singapore is one of the few countries that you can enter or leave by taxi. While normal Singaporean taxis are not allowed to cross into Malaysia and vice versa, specially licensed Singaporean taxis permitted to go to the Kotaraya shopping mall (only) can be booked from Johor Taxi Service â +65 62967054, $45 one way), while Malaysian taxis, which can go anywhere in Malaysia, can be taken from Rochor Rd ($32 to charter, or $8/person if you share with others).  In the reverse direction, towards Singapore, you can take taxis from Kotaraya to any point in central Singapore ($30) or Changi Airport ($40). The main advantage here is that you do not need to lug your stuff (or yourself) through Customs at both ends; you can just sit in the car.
A combination ride from anywhere in Singapore to anywhere in Malaysia can also be arranged, but you'll need to swap taxis halfway through: this will cost S$50 and up, paid to the Singaporean driver. The most expensive option is to take a limousine taxi specially licensed to take passengers from any point to any destination, but only a few are available and they charge a steep RM150 per trip. Advance booking is highly recommended, â +60 7 5991622.

<a href="/en/File:Singapore-overview.png" class="image" title="Map of Singapore, with MRT lines and key attractions"><img alt="Map of Singapore, with MRT lines and key attractions" src="http://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/b/b9/Singapore-overview.png/450px-Singapore-overview.png" width="450" height="259" /></a>
Getting around Singapore is easy: the public transportation system is extremely easy to use and taxis are reasonably priced when you can get one.  Very few visitors rent cars.  <b>Gothere.sg</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://gothere.sg/">[28]</a> does a pretty good job of figuring out the fastest route by MRT and bus and even estimating taxi fares between any two points.
If you are staying in Singapore for some time or are planning to return to Singapore several times in the future, the <b>EZ-link</b><a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.ezlink.com.sg">[29]</a> contactless RFID farecard or a <b>Nets Flash Pay</b> card might be a worthwhile purchase.  Those who are familiar with Hong Kong's Octopus card, London Underground's Oyster card, Washington DC's SmarTrip card or Japan Railway's IC cards will quickly understand the concept of the EZ-link and NETS FlashPay card. You can store value on it and use it on the MRT trains as well as all city buses at a 15% discount.  The card costs $12, including $7 stored value, and the card can be "topped up" in increments of at least $10 at the farecard vending machines or 7-Eleven stores (the latter will allow a top-up for a convenience fee). You can use the same card for 5 years. The card technology was changed in 2009, but if you have any old cards lying around, they can be exchanged for free with value intact at TransitLink offices in all MRT stations.
Alternatively, <b>the Singapore Tourist Pass</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.thesingaporetouristpass.com.sg/">[30]</a> available at selected major MRT stations (including Changi Airport and Orchard) also includes ez-link card functionality and a variety of discounts for attractions. The pass includes unlimited travel on MRT and non-premium buses, and costs $10 for 1 day, $16 for 2 days, or $20 for 3 days (together with a $10 rental deposit refunded if this card is returned within 5 days after purchase). The passes are valid until the end of operating hours on the day they expire.
Single tickets can be purchased for both MRT and buses. In the case of buses it delays everyone else because the driver has to count fare stages to tell you how much you need to pay. In addition, no change is given for the bus and you will need to buy a separate ticket if you intend to transfer to another bus later in your journey.
<b>Distance based fares</b><a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.publictransport.sg/publish/ptp/en/distance_based_fares.html">[31]</a> have been introduced since July 2010. All commuters will be charged a fare according to the total distance travelled, on the bus, LRT and MRT, and make transfers without incurring additional cost.
<br />
The <b>MRT</b> (Mass Rapid Transit) and <b>LRT</b> (Light Rail Transit) are trains that are the main trunk of Singapore's transit system.  They are a cheap and very reliable mode of transportation, and the network covers most points of interest for the visitor. EZ-link or Nets FlashPay farecards (described above) are the easiest and most popular ways to use the MRT. All lines are seamlessly integrated, even if the lines are operated by different transport companies, so you do not need to buy a new ticket to transfer. All train lines use contactless RFID tickets. Just tap to scan your train ticket at the gantry when entering and exiting the train service area. Single-trip tickets are purchased from ticket machines located before the gantries and cost from $0.80 to $2.20. A $0.10 deposit is charged when purchasing a new ticket card. The deposit is refunded in double through a $0.10 fare reduction each on the 3rd and 6th trip made with the card. To load a new ticket onto an existing card at a ticket machine, just place it on the designated spot and follow the on-screen instructions.
<b>Distance based fares</b><br />
Please remember these points to enjoy full benefits of distance based fares:<br />
The MRT stations are clean and usually equipped with free toilets.  Underground stations have platform screen doors between the train and the platform while most above-ground stations have Half-height Platform Screen Doors (HHPSDs) so there is no risk of falling onto the tracks. The North-East line is fully automated, as is the new Circle Line, the LRT and all upcoming lines, so it's worth walking up to the front of the train to look out a tiny window and realize that there is no driver! There are exceptions though, when a staff member comes in to drive the train. This is common when a train's automatic driving system fails. In this case, a tape will be put up behind the driving area to prevent passengers from interfering with the driver.
<b>Buses</b> connect various corners of Singapore, but are slower and harder to use than the MRT.  The advantage though of this is you get to see the sights rather than a dark underground tunnel at a low price.  You can pay cash (coins) in buses, but the fare stage system is quite complex (it's easiest to ask the driver for the price to your destination), you are charged marginally more and there is no provision for getting change. Payment with ez-link or Nets Flashpay card is thus the easiest method: tap your card against the reader at the front entrance of the bus when boarding, and a maximum fare is deducted from the card.  When you alight, tap your card again at the exit, and the difference is refunded. Make sure you tap out, or you'll end up paying the maximum fare! Inspectors occasionally prowl buses to check that everybody has paid or tapped, so those who are on tourist day passes should tap before sitting down. Dishonest bus commuters risk getting fine $20 for not paying or underpaying fares (by premature tapping-out) and $50 for improper use of concession cards.  Another advantage of ez-link or Nets Flashpay cards is that you will be able to enjoy distance-based fares and avoid the boarding fee.
After midnight <i>on Fri, Sat and before public holidays only</i>, the <b>NightRider</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.smrt.com.sg/buses/nightrider.asp">[32]</a> services are a fairly convenient way of getting around, with seven lines running every 20 min.  All services drive past the major nightlife districts of Boat Quay, Clarke Quay, Mohamed Sultan and Orchard before splintering off.  There is a flat fare of $4.00, the EZ-link card is accepted but the Singapore Tourist Pass is not valid on this line.
As mentioned earlier, Gothere.sg will give you options as to which busses will take you from your origin or destination.
<b>Taxis</b> use meters and are reasonably priced and honest, however, a shortage of taxis in Singapore means that they are often unavailable for hours at a time.  Outside weekday peak hours, trips within the city centre should not cost you more than $10 and even a trip right across the island from Changi to Jurong will not break the $35 mark.  If you are in a group of 3 or 4, it's sometimes cheaper and faster to take a taxi than the MRT.  Be aware, however, that taxis are often remarkably difficult to secure, especially during peak commute or shopping hours, or when there is inclement weather.  During these times it can be impossible to get through to a booking agent via telephone, and you can expect extended waits in taxi queues. There is a puzzling lack of action to address this persistent and frustrating taxi shortage.
Taxi pricing is largely identical across all companies at $3.00-$3.20 as a flag down rate (depending on the type of vehicle used), which lasts you 1 km before increments of  $0.22 per 400 m (for the first 10 km) or $0.22 per 350 m (after the first 10 km). (The sole exception is SMRT's giant black Chryslers, which charge $5 and then $0.30 per 385 m.) Watch out for surprises though: there are a myriad of peak hour (25%), late night (50%), central business district ($3), trips from airport or the IRs ($3-$5 during peak hours), phone booking ($3.00 and up) and Electronic Road Pricing surcharges, which may add a substantial amount to your taxi fare.  All such charges are shown on the bottom right-hard corner of the meter, recorded in the printed receipt and explained in tedious detail in a sticker on the window; if you suspect the cabbie is trying to pull a fast one, call the company and ask for an explanation. Note that there is no surcharge for trips <i>to</i> the airport. While all taxis are equipped to handle (and are required to accept) credit cards, in practice many cabbies do not accept electronic payment. Always ask before getting in. Paying by credit card will incur an additional surcharge of 17%. During rush hour in the city centre, or late at night on the weekends, it's wise to call for a taxi from the unified booking system at â +65 6342 5222 (6-DIAL-CAB).  Some taxi companies offer booking via SMS, online and mobile app.
Despite the costs involved, taxis may sometimes take you to distant locations outside the CBD faster than mass transport.  An airport trip from the city centre may take less than 20 mins on a taxi but more than 30 mins on an MRT.
In the Central Business District, taxis may pick up passengers only at taxi stands (found outside any shopping mall) or buildings with their own driveways (including virtually all hotels). Outside the centre, you're free to hail taxis on the street or call one to your doorstep. At night spots featuring long queues, such as Clarke Quay, you may on occasion be approached by touts offering a quick flat fare to your destination. This is illegal and very expensive but reasonably safe for you. (Drivers, on the other hand, will probably lose their job if caught.)
Some Singapore taxi drivers have very poor geographical knowledge and may expect you to know where they should go, so it may be helpful to bring a map of your destination area or directions on finding where you wish to go. It may also be helpful to <i>write down</i> the address of your destination. Some cabbies may also ask you which route you want to take; most are satisfied with "whichever way is faster".
<b>Trishaws</b>, three-wheeled bicycle taxis, haunt the area around the Singapore River and Chinatown.  Geared purely for tourists, they should be avoided for serious travel as locals do not use them. There is little room for bargaining: short rides will cost $10-20 and an hour's sightseeing charter about $50 per person.
Tourist-oriented <b>bumboats</b> cruise the <a href="/en/Singapore/Riverside" title="Singapore/Riverside">Singapore River</a>, offering point-to-point rides starting from $3 and cruises with nice views of the CBD skyscraper skyline starting from $13.
Bumboats also shuttle passengers from Changi Village to <a href="/en/Singapore/East_Coast#Do" title="Singapore/East Coast">Pulau Ubin</a> ($2.50 one-way), a small island off Singapore's northeast coast which is about as close as Singapore gets to unhurried rural living.
Car rental is not a popular option in Singapore.  It is also hardly necessary for tourists since public transport sufficiently covers all areas of the island with a significant population base.  You will usually be looking at upwards for $100 per day for the smallest vehicle from the major rental companies, although local ones can be cheaper and there are sometimes good weekend prices available. This does not include gas at around $1.80/litre or electronic road pricing (ERP) fees, and you'll usually need to pay extra to drive to <a href="/en/Malaysia" title="Malaysia">Malaysia</a>.  If planning on touring Malaysia by car, it makes much more sense to head across the border to <a href="/en/Johor_Bahru" title="Johor Bahru">Johor Bahru</a>, where both rentals and petrol are half price, and you have the option of dropping your car off elsewhere in the country. This also avoids the unwelcome extra attention that Singapore-registered plates tend to get from thieves and greedy cops in Malaysia.
One rental company called <b>smove</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.smove.sg">[33]</a> offers electric vehicle rentals. With a $19 registration fee, you can rent the electric car from 15 minutes to a full day. Since the cars are battery powered, you save on the cost of gas. They offer their service in the Buona Vista area of Singapore.
Roads in Singapore are in excellent condition and driving habits are generally good with most people following the traffic rules due to stringent enforcement, though road courtesy tends to be sorely lacking. Compared to other major cities around the world like <a href="/en/Sydney" title="Sydney">Sydney</a>, <a href="/en/Tokyo" title="Tokyo">Tokyo</a> or <a href="/en/Hong_Kong" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a>, parking spaces are comparatively easier to find in the city centre of Singapore, although peak hour congestion can be quite severe. Foreign licences in English are valid in Singapore for up to a year from your date of entry, after which you will have to convert your foreign license to a Singapore one. Foreign licences not in English must be accompanied by an International Driving Permit (IDP) or an official English translation (usually available from your embassy) for them to be valid.
Singaporeans drive on the left (UK style) and the driving age is 18. The speed limit is only 90 km/h on expressways and 60 km/h on other roads.
ERP payments require a stored-value CashCard, which is usually arranged by the rental agency, but it's your responsibility to ensure it has enough value.  ERP gantries are activated at different times, usually in the expected direction of most cars.  As a rule of thumb, gantries found in roads leading to the CBD are activated during the morning rush hour while gantries found in roads exiting the CBD are activated during the evening rush hour.  Passing through an active ERP gantry with insufficient value will mean that an alert is sent to your registered address.  You will need to pay an administrative fee in addition to the difference between the remaining amount and the actual charge. You have a limited time to settle this otherwise your penalty becomes heavier.
<i>All</i> passengers must wear seatbelts and using a phone while driving is banned. Drink-driving is not tolerated: the maximum blood alcohol content is 0.08%, with roadblocks set up at night to catch offenders, who are heavily fined and possibly jailed. Even if your blood alcohol level does not exceed the legal limit, you can still be charged with drink driving if the police are convinced that your ability to control the vehicle has been compromised by the presence of alcohol (i.e. if you get involved in an accident). The police do conduct periodic roadblocks and speed cameras are omnipresent. Fines will be sent by mail to you or your rental agency, who will then pass on the cost with a surcharge.  If stopped for a traffic offense, don't even <i>think</i> about trying to bribe your way out.
<a href="/en/Hitchhiking" title="Hitchhiking" class="mw-redirect">Hitchhiking</a> is virtually unheard of in Singapore, and given the size of the country and its cheap, ubiquitous public transport, it's hardly necessary. Plus, it's also highly illegal.
Using bicycles as a substitute for public transport is possible, although there's little cycling culture and amenities like bike lanes or bike racks are a rarity.  While the city is small and its landscape is flat, it can be difficult to predict how ridable a route will be without scoping it out first. Buses, taxis, and motorists stopping to drop off or pick up passengers rarely check for cyclists before merging back onto the roadway, which makes certain routes especially treacherous.  The ubiquitous road works around Singapore can also make cycling more hazardous when temporary road surfaces are not kept safe for biking, portable traffic barriers make it hard for vehicles to see cyclists, and construction crews directing traffic are unsure of how to deal with cyclists on the roadway.
Air quality can also be a problem.  According to Singapore's LTA, Singapore has more than 178,000 diesel powered cars, taxis, buses, and trucks, which can make biking on Singapore's crowded roads very unpleasant.  When the thick smoke from Indonesian fires descends on Singapore, air quality plummets even further. This period usually arrives during the mid year when Indonesia performs the "slash and burn" method of removing waste crops.
There are few bike lanes in Singapore, and none in the city centre.  The 2010 campaign, "1.5M Matters" seems to have little effect on the driving habits of Singaporeans, who often pass uncomfortably close to cyclists. But that may be because of the lack of a bicycle lane on the roads and motorists are very often forced to swerve into the adjacent lane in order to avoid hitting a cyclist. 22 cyclists were killed on Singapore roadways in 2008; the next year, 19.  According to the Singapore "Ride of Silence" two cyclists are hit by motor vehicles every day in Singapore. Cycling on the pavements would be a better idea, but watch out for pedestrians!
Small folding bicycles may be taken on the MRT during certain times of the day, but large bicycles are a no-no.  Bicycles may cross the Causeway to Malaysia (on motorbike lanes), but are not allowed on expressways.
Singapore is generally fairly 'pedestrian-friendly'.  In the main business district and on main roadways, pavements and pedestrian crossings are in good shape and plentiful.  Drivers are mindful of marked crossing zones, but are less likely be aware or respectful of pedestrians crossing at streetcorners on less busy streets where crosswalks are not marked, even though by law any accident between a pedestrian and a vehicle is presumed to be the driver's fault.  In residential areas of Singapore, pedestrians can be frustrated by narrow and poorly-maintained pavements that often jump from one side of the street to the other or just disappear, and frequently are obstructed by trash cans and plantings.  Jaywalking is illegal and punished with fines of $25 and up to three months in jail.
Classic walks in Singapore include walking <a href="/en/Singapore/Riverside" title="Singapore/Riverside">down the river</a> from the Merlion through the Quays, trekking along the <a href="/en/Southern_Ridges_Walk" title="Southern Ridges Walk">Southern Ridges Walk</a> or just strolling around <a href="/en/Singapore/Chinatown" title="Singapore/Chinatown">Chinatown</a>, <a href="/en/Singapore/Little_India" title="Singapore/Little India">Little India</a> or <a href="/en/Singapore/Bugis" title="Singapore/Bugis">Bugis</a>.
An unavoidable downside, though, is the tropical <b>heat and humidity</b>, which leaves many visitors sweaty and exhausted, so bring along a handkerchief and a bottle of water. It's best to get an early start, pop into air-conditioned shops, cafes, and museums to cool off, and plan on heading back to the shopping mall or hotel pool before noon. Alternatively, after sundown, evenings can also be comparatively cool.
<b>Who are the people in your neighbourhood?</b><br />

<b>Burmese</b>: Peninsula Plaza, on North Bridge Rd<br />
<b>Chinese</b>: Waterloo Street (Singapore's 'new Chinatown')<br />

<a href="/en/Malay_phrasebook" title="Malay phrasebook">Malay</a> may be enshrined in the Constitution as the national language, but in practice the most common language is English, spoken by almost every Singaporean under the age of 50 with varying degrees of fluency.  English is spoken much better here than in most Asian neighbours.  English is also the medium of instruction in schools, except for mother tongue subjects (e.g. Malay, Mandarin and Tamil), which are also required to be learned in school by Singaporeans.  In addition, all official signs and documents are written in English, usually using British spelling.
However, the distinctive local patois <b>Singlish</b> may be hard to understand at times, as it incorporates slang words and phrases from other languages, including various Chinese dialects, Malay and Tamil as well as English words whose pronunciation or meaning have been corrupted. Additionally, it has an odd way of structuring sentences, due to the original speakers being mostly Chinese. Complex consonant clusters are simplified, articles and plurals disappear, verb tenses are replaced by adverbs, questions are altered to fit the Chinese syntax and semirandom particles (especially the infamous "lah") appear:
Singlish: <i>You wan beer or not?  -- Dunwan lah, dring five bottle oreddi.</i>
English: <i>Do you want a beer? -- No, thanks; I've already had five bottles.</i>
It is also inclusive of multilingual references, to events past or current. These can be of the innocuous variety, or they can be satirical or political in nature. An example of the former would be 'mee siam mai hum" (Vermicelli in Spicy Gravy without cockles) - ostensibly the name of a hawker dish, but given another layer of subtext by popular local blogger mrbrown. Practise caution when ordering this particular dish - it will be sure to draw sniggers from the younger crowd (It's a tautology. The dish never contains cockles, and is a malapropism from the current Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong)
Thanks to nationwide language education campaigns, most younger Singaporeans are, however, capable of speaking what the government calls "good English" when necessary. To avoid unintentional offense, it's best to start off with standard English and shift to simplified pidgin only if it becomes evident that the other person cannot follow you. Try to resist the temptation to sprinkle your speech with unnecessary Singlishisms: you'll get a laugh if you do it right, but it sounds patronizing if you do it wrong.  Wikipedia's Singlish <a class="external autonumber" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singlish">[35]</a> article goes into obsessive and occasionally impenetrable grammatical detail, but the sections on vocabulary <a class="external autonumber" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singlish_vocabulary">[36]</a> and abbreviations <a class="external autonumber" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Singapore_abbreviations">[37]</a> are handy.
Singapore's other official languages are <a href="/en/Chinese_phrasebook" title="Chinese phrasebook">Mandarin Chinese</a> and <a href="/en/Tamil_phrasebook" title="Tamil phrasebook">Tamil</a>. Mandarin is spoken by most younger Singaporean Chinese while Tamil is spoken by most Indians. Like English, the Mandarin spoken in Singapore has also evolved into a distinctive creole and often incorporates words from other Chinese dialects, Malay and English, though all Singaporean Chinese are taught standard Mandarin in school. Various Chinese dialects (mostly <a href="/en/Minnan_phrasebook" title="Minnan phrasebook">Hokkien</a>, though significant numbers also speak Teochew and <a href="/en/Cantonese_phrasebook" title="Cantonese phrasebook">Cantonese</a>) are also spoken between ethnic Chinese of the same dialect group, though their use has been declining in the younger generation since the 1980s due to government policies discouraging the use of dialects in favour of Mandarin.  Other Indian languages, such as <a href="/en/Punjabi_phrasebook" title="Punjabi phrasebook">Punjabi</a> among the Sikhs, are also spoken.
The official Chinese script used in Singapore is the simplified script used in mainland China. As such, all official publications (including local newspapers) and signs are in simplified Chinese and all ethnic Chinese are taught to write the simplified script in school. However, the older generations still prefer the traditional style, and the popularity of Hong Kong and Taiwanese pop culture means that even the youth can usually read traditional Chinese.
Sights in Singapore are covered in more detail under the various districts.  Broadly speaking:
Useful to carry:
While you <i>can</i> find a place to practice nearly any sport in Singapore &#8212; golfing, surfing, scuba diving, even ice skating and snow skiing &#8212; due to the country's small size your options are rather limited and prices are relatively high.  For water sports in particular, the busy shipping lanes and sheer population pressure mean that the sea around Singapore is murky, and most locals head up to <a href="/en/Tioman" title="Tioman">Tioman</a> (Malaysia) or <a href="/en/Bintan" title="Bintan">Bintan</a> (Indonesia) instead. On the upside, there is an abundance of dive shops in Singapore, and they often arrange weekend trips to good dive sites off the East Coast of Malaysia, so they are a good option for accessing some of Malaysia's not-so touristy dive sites.
Singapore may be a young country but it has a constantly evolving artistic landscape that draws its influences from its unique heritage of East and Southeast Asian culture, with a good mix of western touch.
The Renaissance City Project was initiated in 2000 by the Singaporean Government to establish Singapore as a regional city of the arts to cultivate artistic interest and culture. Today, Singapore sees itself flourishing in the third phase of the renaissance city project with new museums, international galleries and art fairs entering the local artistic landscape.
In 2011, Singapore saw the opening of the ArtScience Museum at The Marina Bay Sands, a museum dedicated to design and technology. And in 2012, fourteen international galleries arrived at the shore of Singapore housed at The Gillman Barracks, a new artistic area. The city state is also anticipating the inaugural opening of The National Art Gallery in 2015; the largest visual arts institution in Singapore and also one of the largest regionally, focusing on modern Southeast Asian art through its collection.
Singapore's art district, located around the Dhoby Ghaut and City Hall area have a concentration of art institutions, museums and galleries. Notable museums and art venues include, the National Museum of Singapore, Singapore Art Museum, The Substation (Singapore's first independent contemporary art centre) and Art Plural Gallery, Singapore's largest art gallery.
On the cultural side of things, Singapore has been trying to shake off its boring, buttoned-up reputation and attract more artists and performances, with mixed success. The star in Singapore's cultural sky is the <b>Esplanade</b> theatre in <a href="/en/Singapore/Marina_Bay" title="Singapore/Marina Bay">Marina Bay</a>, a world-class facility for performing arts and a frequent stage for the Singapore Symphony Orchestra. Pop culture options are more limited and Singapore's home-grown arts scene remains rather moribund, although local starlets Stefanie Sun and JJ Lin have had some success in the Chinese pop scene. On the upside, any bands and DJs touring Asia are pretty much guaranteed to perform in Singapore.
Going to the <b>movies</b> is a popular Singaporean pastime, but look for "R21" ratings (21 and up only) if you like your movies with fewer cuts.  The big three theatre chains are <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.cathay.com.sg">Cathay</a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.gv.com.sg/">Golden Village</a> and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.shaw.sg/">Shaw Brothers</a>.  Censorship continues to throttle the local film scene, but Jack Neo's popular comedies showcase the foibles of Singaporean life.
In summer, don't miss the yearly <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.singaporeartsfest.com">Singapore Arts Festival</a>.  Advance tickets for almost any cultural event can be purchased from <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.sistic.com.sg/">SISTIC</a>, either on-line or from any of their numerous ticketing outlets, including the Singapore Visitor Centre on <a href="/en/Singapore/Orchard" title="Singapore/Orchard">Orchard Rd</a>.
Singapore has two integrated resorts with casinos. <b>Marina Bay Sands</b> at <a href="/en/Singapore/Marina_Bay" title="Singapore/Marina Bay">Marina Bay</a> is the larger and swankier of the two, while <b>Resorts World Sentosa</b> at <a href="/en/Singapore/Sentosa" title="Singapore/Sentosa">Sentosa</a> aims for a more family-friendly experience (but offers No Limit Holdem from $5/$10).  While locals (citizens and permanent residents) have to pay $100/day to get in, foreign visitors can enter for free after presenting their passport.
Besides the casino, there are other forms of legalised betting which are more accessible to the locals. This includes horse racing, which is run by the <b>Singapore Turf Club</b><a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.turfclub.com.sg">[39]</a> on weekends, as well as football (soccer) betting and several lotteries run by the <b>Singapore Pools</b><a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.singaporepools.com.sg">[40]</a>.
Mahjong is also a popular pastime in Singapore. The version played in Singapore is similar to the Cantonese version, but it also has extra "animal tiles" not present in the original Cantonese version. However, this remains pretty much a family and friends affair, and there are no mahjong parlours.
Despite its small size, Singapore has a surprisingly large number of golf courses, but most of the best ones are run by private clubs and open to members and their guests only. The main exceptions are the Sentosa Golf Club <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.sentosagolf.com/">[41]</a>, the famously challenging home of the Barclays Singapore Open, and the Marina Bay Golf Course <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.mbgc.com.sg/">[42]</a>, the only 18-hole public course. See the Singapore Golf Association <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.sga.org.sg/">[43]</a> for the full list; alternatively, head to the nearby Indonesian islands of <a href="/en/Batam" title="Batam">Batam</a> or <a href="/en/Bintan" title="Bintan">Bintan</a> or up north to the Malaysian town of <a href="/en/Malacca" title="Malacca">Malacca</a> for cheaper rounds.
The inaugural <b>F1 Singapore Grand Prix</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.singaporegp.sg">[44]</a> was held at night in September 2008, and will be a fixture on the local calendar.The F1 Organizers have confirmed that the night race will be extended till 2017.  Held on a street circuit in the heart of Singapore and raced at night, all but race fans will probably wish to <i>avoid</i> this time, as hotel prices especially room with view of the F1 tracks are through the roof.  Tickets start from $150 but the thrilling experience of night race is definitely unforgettable for all F1 fans and photo buffs. Besides being a uniquely night race, the carnival atmosphere and pop concert held around the race ground as well as the convenience of hotels and restaurants round the corner, distinguish the race from other F1 races held remotely away from urban centres.
The <b>Singapore Turf Club</b><a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.turfclub.com.sg/">[45]</a> in <a href="/en/Singapore/North_and_West" title="Singapore/North and West">Kranji</a> hosts horse races most Fridays, including a number of international cups, and is popular with local gamblers.  The <b>Singapore Polo Club</b><a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.singaporepoloclub.org/">[46]</a> near <a href="/en/Singapore/Balestier" title="Singapore/Balestier">Balestier</a> is also open to the public on competition days.
Singapore has recently been experiencing a 'spa boom', and there is now plenty of choice for everything from holistic Ayurveda to green tea hydrotherapy.  However, prices aren't as rock-bottom as in neighbours Indonesia and Thailand, and you'll generally be looking at upwards of $50 even for a plain one-hour massage.  Premium spas can be found in most 5 star hotels and on <a href="/en/Singapore/Orchard" title="Singapore/Orchard">Orchard</a>, and <a href="/en/Singapore/Sentosa" title="Singapore/Sentosa">Sentosa</a>'s Spa Botanica also has a good reputation.  There are also numerous shops offering traditional Chinese massage, which are mostly legitimate.  The less legitimate "health centres" have been shut down.  Traditional asian-style public baths are non-existent.
When looking for beauty salons on Orchard Road, try out the ones on the fourth floor of Lucky Plaza. They offer most salon services like manicures, pedicures, facials, waxing and hair services. A favorite of flight crew and repeat tourists due to the lower costs as compared to the sky high prices of other salons along the shopping belt. Shop around for prices, some of the better looking ones actually charge less.
Forget your tiny hotel pool if you are into competitive or recreational swimming: Singapore is paradise for swimmers with arguably the highest density of public pools in the world. They are all open-air 50 m pools (some facilities even feature up to three 50 m pools), accessible for an  entrance fee of $1-1.50. Some of the visitors don't swim at all. They just come from nearby housing complexes for a few hours to chill out, read and relax in the sun. Most are open daily from 8AM-9PM, and all feature a small cafe.  Just imagine swimming your lanes in the tropical night with lit up palm trees surrounding the pool.
The Singapore Sports Council maintains a list of pools <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.ssc.gov.sg/publish/Corporate/en/participation/hotspot/sports_facility/swimming_complex.html">[47]</a>, most of which are part of a larger sports complex with gym, tennis courts etc, and are located near the MRT station they're named after.  Perhaps the best is in Katong (111 Wilkinson Road, on the <a href="/en/Singapore/East_Coast" title="Singapore/East Coast">East Coast</a>): after the swim, stroll through the villa neighbourhood directly in front of the pool entrance and have at look at the luxurious, original architecture of the houses that really rich Singaporeans live in. If you get bored with regular swimming pools, head to the <b>Jurong East Swimming Complex</b> where you get the wave pool, water slides and Jacuzzi at an insanely affordable entrance fee of $1.50 on weekdays and $2 on weekends.
For those who feel richer, visit the <b>Wild Wild Wet</b><a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.wildwildwet.com">[48]</a> water theme park with $19 and get yourself wet with various exciting water slides and a powerful tidal wave pool.
For those who don't like pools, head out to the beaches. The <b><a href="/en/Singapore/East_Coast" title="Singapore/East Coast">East Coast Park</a></b> has a scenic coastline that stretches over 15 km. It's a popular getaway spot for Singaporeans to swim, cycle, barbeque and engage in various other sports and activities. <b><a href="/en/Singapore/Sentosa" title="Singapore/Sentosa">Sentosa island</a></b> also has three white, sandy beaches - Siloso Beach, Palawan Beach and Tanjong Beach - each with its own distinct characteristics, and also very popular with locals.
Besides the more regular water sports such as waterskiing, wakeboarding, windsurfing, canoeing and etc., Singapore also offers water sports fans trendy activities such as cable-Skiing and wave surfing in specially created environments.
While obviously not the best place on Earth for skiing, sunny Singapore still has a permanent indoor snow centre &#8212; Snow City offers visitors to the region a chance to experience winter. Visitors can escape from the hot and humid tropical weather to play with snow or even learn to ski and snowboard with internationally certified professional instructors.
The Singaporean currency is the <b>Singapore dollar</b>, abbreviated <b>SGD</b>, <b>S$</b> or just <b>$</b> (as used throughout this guide), divided into 100 cents. There are coins of $0.01 (bronze), $0.05 (gold), $0.10 (silver), $0.20 (silver), $0.50 (silver) and $1 (gold), plus notes of $2 (purple), $5 (green), $10 (red), $50 (blue), $100 (orange), $1000 (purple) and $10000 (gold). The <a href="/en/Brunei" title="Brunei">Brunei</a> dollar is pegged at par with the Singapore dollar and the two currencies can be used interchangeably in both countries, so don't be too surprised if you get a Brunei note as change.    You can safely assume that the '$' sign used in the island-nation refers to SGD unless it includes other initials (e.g. US$ to stand for US Dollar).
Restaurants often display prices like $19.99++, which means that service charge (10%) and sales tax (7%) are not included and will be added to your bill.  When you see NETT, it means it includes all taxes and service charges.  <b>Tipping</b> is generally <i>not</i> practised in Singapore, and is officially frowned upon by the government, although bellhops still expect $2 or so per bag.  Taxis will usually return your change to the last cent, or round in your favor if they can't be bothered to dig for change.
<b>ATMs</b> are ubiquitous in Singapore and <b>credit cards</b> are widely accepted (although some shops may levy a 3% surcharge, and taxis a whopping 15%). Travellers cheques are generally <i>not</i> accepted by retailers, but can be cashed at most exchange booths.  eZ-Link and Nets Flash Pay cards are accepted in some convenience stores and fast food chains.
<b>Currency exchange</b> booths can be found in every shopping mall and usually offer better rates, better opening hours and much faster service than banks.   The huge 24 hr operation at Mustafa in <a href="/en/Singapore/Little_India" title="Singapore/Little India">Little India</a> accepts almost any currency at very good rates, as do the fiercely competitive small shops at the aptly named Change Alley next to Raffles Place MRT.  For large amounts, ask for a quote, as it will often get you a better rate than displayed on the board.  Rates at the airport are not as good as in the city, and while many department stores accept major foreign currencies, their rates are often terrible.
Singapore is expensive by Asian standards but affordable compared with some industrialised countries: $50 is a perfectly serviceable daily backpacker budget if you are willing to cut some corners, though you would probably wish to double that for comfort.  Food in particular is a steal, with excellent hawker food available for under $5 for a generous serving.  Accommodation is a little pricier, but a bed in a hostel can cost less than $20, an average 3-4 star hotel in the city centre would typically cost anywhere from $100-$300 per night for a basic room, and the most luxurious hotels on the island (except maybe the Raffles) can be yours for $300 with the right discounts during the off-peak season.
Budget travellers should note that Singapore is much more expensive than the rest of Southeast Asia and should budget accordingly if planning to spend time in Singapore. In general, prices in Singapore are about twice as high as in Malaysia and Thailand and 3-5 times as high as in Indonesia and the Philippines.
<b>Cheated?</b><br />

Shopping is second only to eating as a national pastime, which means that Singapore has an <b>abundance</b> of shopping malls, and low taxes and tariffs on imports coupled with huge volume mean that prices are usually very competitive.  While you won't find any bazaars with dirt-cheap local handicrafts (in fact, virtually everything sold in Singapore is made elsewhere), goods are generally of reasonably good quality and shopkeepers are generally quite honest due to strong consumer protection laws. Most shops are open 7 days a week from 10AM-10PM, although smaller operations (particularly those outside shopping malls) close earlier &#8212; 7PM is common &#8212; and perhaps on Sundays as well.  Mustafa in <a href="/en/Singapore/Little_India#Buy" title="Singapore/Little India">Little India</a> is open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.  Keep an eye out for the <b>Great Singapore Sale</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.greatsingaporesale.com.sg/">[49]</a>, usually held in June-July, when shopping centres pull out all stops to attract punters. Many shops along Orchard Road and Scotts Road now offer late night shopping on the last Friday of every month with over 250 retailers staying open till midnight.
For purchases of over $100 per day per participating shop, you may be able to get a 6% refund of your 7% GST at Changi Airport or Seletar Airport, but the process is a bit of a bureaucratic hassle. At the shop you need to ask for a tax refund cheque. Before checking in at the airport, present this cheque together with the items purchased and your passport at the GST customs counter. Get the receipt stamped there. Then proceed with check-in and go through security. On the air side, bring the stamped cheque to the refund counter to cash it in or get the GST back on your credit card. See Singapore Customs <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.customs.gov.sg/leftNav/trav/Tourist+Refund+Scheme.htm">[50]</a> for the full scoop.

Singapore is a melting pot of cuisines from around the world, and many Singaporeans are obsessive gourmands who love to <i>makan</i> ("eat" in Malay).  You will find quality Chinese, Malay, Indian, Japanese, Thai, Italian, French, American and other food in this city-state. One of the best kept secrets is that tourists can get a great bargain (up to 50% discount) at many of Singapore's best restaurants by registering at the foodie website <b>MakanDeals</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.makandeals.com/">[51]</a> for free and downloading its dining vouchers.
Eating habits run the gamut, but most foods are eaten by <b>fork and spoon</b>: push and cut with the fork in the left hand, and eat with the spoon in the right.  Noodles and Chinese dishes typically come with chopsticks, while Malay and Indian food can be eaten by hand, but nobody will blink an eye if you ask for a fork and spoon instead. If eating by hand, always use your right hand to pick your food, as Malays and Indians traditionally use their left hand to handle dirty things. Take note of the usual traditional <a href="/en/China" title="China">Chinese</a> etiquette when using chopsticks, and most importantly, <i>do not</i> stick your chopsticks vertically into a bowl of rice. If eating in a group, serving dishes are always shared, but you'll get your own bowl of rice and soup.  It's common to use your own chopsticks to pick up food from communal plates, but serving spoons can be provided on request.
Keep an eye out for the <b>Singapore Food Festival</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.singaporefoodfestival.com/">[52]</a>, held every year in July.  During the last three festivals, all visitors to Singapore smart enough to ask for them at any tourist information desk received coupons for <b>free chilli crab</b>, no strings attached!
Singapore is justly famous for its food, a unique mix of Malay, Chinese, Indian and Western elements.  The following is only a brief sampler of the most popular dishes.
A plate of chilli crab
Katong <i>laksa</i>, with chilli paste and chopped laksa leaf in a spoon
Satay with peanut sauce, onions and cucumber
<b>Culinary borrowings</b><br />
Many regional terms and the odd euphemism tend to crop up in notionally English menus.  A few of the more common ones:
The most identifiable cuisine in the region is <b>Peranakan</b> or <b>Nonya</b> cuisine, born from the mixed Malay and Chinese communities of what were once the British colonies of the Straits Settlements (modern-day <strong class="selflink">Singapore</strong>, <a href="/en/Penang" title="Penang">Penang</a> and <a href="/en/Malacca" title="Malacca">Malacca</a>).
Besides these dishes, the Peranakans are also known for their <i>kueh</i> or snacks, which are somewhat different from the Malay versions due to stronger Chinese influences.
The Malays were Singapore's original inhabitants and despite now being outnumbered by the Chinese, their distinctive cuisine is popular to this day.  Characterized by heavy use of spices, most Malay dishes are curries, stews or dips of one kind or another and <b>nasi padang</b> restaurants, offering a wide variety of these to ladle onto your rice, are very popular.
Malay desserts, especially the sweet pastries and jellies (<i>kuih</i> or <i>kueh</i>) made largely from coconut and palm sugar (<i>gula melaka</i>), bear a distinct resemblance to those of <a href="/en/Thailand" title="Thailand">Thailand</a>.  But in the sweltering tropical heat, try one of many concoctions made with ice instead:
<i>Bak kut teh</i> with rice and <i>you tiao</i> fritters
Hainanese chicken rice
Fried hokkien <i>mee</i>
Prawn <i>mee</i> and pork rib soup
Chinese food as eaten in Singapore commonly originates from southern <a href="/en/China" title="China">China</a>, particularly <a href="/en/Fujian" title="Fujian">Fujian</a> and <a href="/en/Guangdong" title="Guangdong">Guangdong</a>.  While "authentic" fare is certainly available, especially in fancier restaurants, the daily fare served in hawker centres has absorbed a number of tropical touches, most notably the fairly heavy use of <b>chilli</b> and the Malay fermented shrimp paste <b>belacan</b> as condiments.  Noodles can also be served not just in soup (æ¹¯ <i>tang</i>), but also "dry" (å¹² <i>kan</i>), meaning that your noodles will be served tossed with chilli and spices in one bowl, and the soup will come in a separate bowl.
The smallest of the area's big three ethnic groups, the Indians have had proportionally the smallest impact on the local culinary scene, but there is no shortage of Indian food even at many hawker centres. Delicious and authentic Indian food can be had at Little India, including south Indian typical meals such as <i>dosa</i> (<i>thosai</i>) crepes, <i>idli</i> lentil-rice cakes and <i>sambar</i> soup, as well as north Indian meals including various curries, <i>naan</i> bread, tandoori chicken and more. In addition, however, a number of Indian dishes have been "Singaporeanized" and adopted by the entire population, including:
<b>Social welfare Singapore style</b><br />
One thing notably absent from Singaporean hawker centres and food courts is any form of napkins or tissues. The solution to the mystery is in Singapore's lack of government welfare: instead, every hawker centre has a resident invalid or two, who make a living by selling tissues ($1 for a few packets). These folks believe in self reliance instead of depending on government welfare funds. Do give them your respectful support.
The cheapest and most popular places to eat in Singapore are <b>hawker centres</b>, essentially former pushcart vendors directed into giant complexes by government fiat.  Prices are low ($2-5 for most dishes), hygiene standards are high (every stall is required to prominently display a health certificate grading it from A to D) and the food can be excellent &#8212; if you see a queue, join it!  Ambience tends to be a little lacking though and there is no air-conditioning either, but a visit to a hawker centre is a must when in Singapore. However, be leery of overzealous pushers-cum-salesmen, especially at the Satay Club in Lau Pa Sat and Newton Food Centre at Newton Circus: the tastiest stalls don't need high-pressure tactics to find customers. Touting for business is illegal, and occasionally a reminder of this can result in people backing off a bit.
To order, first <i>chope</i> (reserve) a table by parking a friend by the table, note the table's number, then place your order at your stall of choice. Employees deliver to your table, and you pay when you get the food.  Note that some stalls (particularly very popular ones) have signs stating "self-service", meaning that you're expected to get your food yourself, but if it is quiet or you are sitting nearby, they will usually deliver anyway. At almost every stall you can also opt to take away (called "packet" or <i>ta pao</i> (æå) in Cantonese), in which case employees pack up your order in a plastic box/bag and even throw in disposable utensils. Once you are finished, just get up and go, as tables are cleared by hired cleaners.
Every district in Singapore has its own hawker centres and prices decrease as you move out into the boondocks.  For tourists, centrally located <b>Newton Circus</b> (<a href="/en/Singapore/Balestier" title="Singapore/Balestier">Newton MRT</a>), <b>Gluttons Bay</b> and <b>Lau Pa Sat</b> (near the <a href="/en/Singapore/Riverside" title="Singapore/Riverside">River</a>), are the most popular options &#8212; but this does not make them the cheapest or the tastiest, and the demanding gourmand would do well to head to <a href="/en/Singapore/Chinatown" title="Singapore/Chinatown">Chinatown</a> or the heartlands instead. Many of the best food stalls are located in residential districts away from the tourist trail and do not advertise in the media, so the best way to find them is to ask locals for their recommendations. A good example is the Old Airport Road Food Centre in a residential area near Dakota MRT station (about a $10-$15 taxi ride from town) which rarely has many tourists and is a true Hawker Centre for locals. And if you miss western food, <b>Botak Jones</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.botakjones.com/">[53]</a> in several hawker centres offers reasonably authentic and generously sized American-restaurant style meals at hawker prices.
<b>Coffee, see, and tea, oh!</b><br />
Coffee and tea in hawker centres and <i>kopitiam</i> goes for under a dollar a cup, a steep discount on Starbucks prices, but you'll need to learn the lingo to get what you want.  If you order just <i>kopi</i> (the Malay word for "coffee") or <i>teh</i> (Hokkien for "tea") in Singapore, it will definitely be served with a heaped spoonful of sugar, and more often than not with a squirt of sweet condensed milk.  <i>Kopi-C</i> or <i>teh-C</i> substitutes unsweetened evaporated milk, while <i>kopi-O</i> or <i>teh-O</i> makes sure it's served with no milk.  To get rid of the sugar, you need to ask for it <i>kosong</i> ("plain"), but if you want a plain black cup of joe, you need to ask for <i>kopi-O kosong</i>! If you want your drink cold, just add a <i>peng</i> to the end of the drink name, eg. <i>kopi-O-peng</i>, <i>teh-peng</i>, <i>teh-C-peng</i>, <i>Milo-peng</i> etc. and it will be served with ice.
Despite the name, coffee shops or <i>kopitiam</i> sell much more than coffee &#8212; they are effectively mini-hawker centres with perhaps only half a dozen stalls (one of which will, however, sell coffee and other drinks).  The Singaporean equivalent of pubs, this is where folks come for the canonical Singaporean breakfast of <i>kopi</i> (strong, sugary coffee), some <i>kaya</i> (egg-coconut jam) toast and runny eggs, and this is also where they come to down a beer or two and chat away in the evenings. English proficiency can somtimes be limited, but most stall owners know enough to communicate the basics, and even if they don't, nearby locals will usually help you out if you ask. Many coffee shops offer <i>tze char</i> (ç®ç) for dinner, meaning a menu of local dishes, mostly Chinese-style seafood, served at your table at mid-range prices.
The usual Starbucks and other local cafe chains such as Coffee Bean &amp; Tea Leaf can be found in any shopping mall but an iced coffee or tea can put you back $5 and up, whereas a <i>teh tarik</i> ("pulled" milky tea) or <i>kopi</i> coffee  runs closer to $1 at any hawker centre.
Found in the basement or top floor of nearly every shopping mall, food courts are the gentrified, air-conditioned version of hawker centres.  The variety of food on offer is almost identical, but prices are on average $1-3 higher than prices in hawker centres and coffee shops (depending on the area, it is slightly more expensive in tourist intensive areas) and the quality of food is good but not necessary value for money.
International fast food chains like McDonald's, Carl's Jr., Burger King, KFC, MOS Burger, Dairy Queen, Orange Julius, Subway etc are commonly found in various shopping malls. Prices range from $2 for a basic burger and $5 upwards for a set meal. All restaurants are self-service and clearing your table after your meal is optional.  In addition to the usual suspects, look out for these uniquely Singaporean brands:
<b>Kee-ping up with the Lims</b><br />
Ever wonder why every other Chinese hawker stall and restaurant in Singapore has a name that ends in <i>Kee</i>?  The answer is simple: the character <i>kee</i> (è®°) is Chinese for "brand" or "mark", and is used much like the trademark symbol in the West.  A name like <i>Yan Kee</i> thus means "run by the Yan family", and should not be taken as a political statement!
Singapore offers a wide variety of full-service restaurants as well, catering to every taste and budget.
As the majority of Singapore's population is ethnic Chinese, there is an abundance of Chinese restaurants in Singapore, mainly serving southern Chinese (mostly Hokkien, Teochew or Cantonese) cuisines, though with the large number of expatriates and foreign workers from China these days, cuisine originating from Shanghai and further north is also not hard to find. As with Chinese restaurants anywhere, food is eaten with chopsticks and served with Chinese tea. While Chinese restaurant food is certainly closer to authentic Chinese fare than hawker food is, it too has not managed to escape local influences and you can find many dishes little seen in <a href="/en/China" title="China">China</a>. Depending on where you go and what you order, prices can vary greatly. In ordinary restaurants, prices usually start from $20-30 per person, while in top end restaurants in five-star hotels, prices can go as high as more than $300 per person if you order delicacies such as abalone, suckling pig and lobster.
Being a maritime city, one common specialty is <b>seafood restaurants</b>, offering Chinese-influenced Singaporean classics like <b>chilli crabs</b>. These are much more fun to go to in a group, but be careful what you order: gourmet items like Sri Lankan giant crab or shark's fin can easily push your bill up to hundreds of dollars. Menus typically say "Market price", and if you ask they'll quote you the price per 100 g, but a big crab can easily top 2 kilos.  The best-known seafood spots are clustered on the <a href="/en/Singapore/East_Coast" title="Singapore/East Coast">East Coast</a>, but for ambience the riverside restaurants at <a href="/en/Singapore/Riverside" title="Singapore/Riverside">Boat Quay and Clarke Quay</a> can't be beat.
Singapore also has its share of good Western restaurants, with British and American influenced food being a clear favourite among locals. Most of the more affordable chains are concentrated around Orchard Road and prices start from around $10-20 per person for the main course. French, Italian, Japanese and Korean food is also readily available, though prices tend to be on the expensive side, while Thai and Indonesian restaurants tend to be more affordable.
One British import much beloved by Singaporeans is <b>high tea</b>.  In the classical form, as served up by finer hotels across the island, this is a light afternoon meal consisting of tea and a wide array of British-style savoury snacks and sweet pastries like finger sandwiches and scones.  However, the term is increasingly used for afternoon buffets of any kind, and Chinese <i>dim sum</i> and various Singaporean dishes are common additions.  Prices vary, but you'll usually be looking at $20-30 per head.  Note that many restaurants only serve high tea on weekends, and hours may be very limited: the famous spread at the Raffles Hotel's Tiffin Room, for example, is only available between 3:30PM-5PM.
Singaporeans are big on <b>buffets</b>, especially international buffets offering a wide variety of dishes including Western, Chinese and Japanese as well as some local dishes at a fixed price.  Popular chains include <b>Sakura</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.sukigroup.com.sg/suki/sakura.htm">[62]</a>, <b>Pariss</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.pariss.com.sg/">[63]</a>, <b>Vienna</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.viennabuffet.com/">[64]</a> and <b>Todai</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.todaisingapore.com/">[65]</a>.
Most hotels also offer lunch and dinner buffets. <b>Champagne brunches</b> on Sundays are particularly popular, but you can expect to pay over $100 per head and popular spots, like Mezza9 at the Hyatt on <a href="/en/Singapore/Orchard" title="Singapore/Orchard">Orchard</a>, will require reservations.
Unlike most other shops, restaurants in Singapore usually do not include the additional charges (7% GST and 10% service charge) in their list prices. Price lists displayed outside restaurants and menus typically indicate this fact with a statement such as "Prices do not include GST and service charge", or indicate their prices with "++", e.g., $19.90++.
While Singapore has been previously described as a place with excellent casual dining but a lack of fine dining options, the opening of the two casinos has led to several of the world's top chefs opening branches of their restaurant at the integrated resorts. Celebrity restaurants that have set up shop at Marina Bay Sands include Santi, Waku Ghin and Guy Savoy . Prices are generally what you would expect for eating at a fine dining restaurant in the West.
Singapore is an easy place to eat for almost everybody.  Many Indians and not a few Chinese Buddhists are strictly <b>vegetarian</b>, so Indian stalls may have a number of veggie options and some hawker centres will have a Chinese vegetarian stall or two, often serving up amazing meat imitations made from gluten.  Chinese vegetarian food traditionally does not use eggs or dairy products and is thus almost always <b>vegan</b>; Indian vegetarian food, however, often employs cheese and other milk products. Be on your guard in ordinary Chinese restaurants though, as even dishes that appear vegetarian on the menu may contain seafood products such as oyster sauce or salted fish &#8212; check with the waiter if in doubt. Some restaurants can be found that use "no garlic, no onions".
Muslims should look out for <b>halal</b> certificates issued by MUIS, the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore. This is found at practically every Malay stall and many Indian Muslim operations too, but more rarely on outlets run by the Chinese, few of whom are Muslims. That said, the popular <b>Banquet</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.banquet.com.sg/">[66]</a> chain of food courts is entirely halal and an excellent choice for safely sampling halal Chinese food. Many, if not all, of the Western fast-food chains in Singapore use halal meat: look for a certificate around the ordering area, or ask a manager if in doubt.  A few restaurants skimp on the formal certification and simply put up "no pork, no lard" signs; it's your call if this is good enough for you.
Jews, on the other hand, will have a harder time as <b>kosher</b> food is nearly unknown in Singapore. Nevertheless, kosher food is still available near Singapore's two synagogues at Oxley Rise and Waterloo Street in the Central Business District; check with the Jewish Welfare Board <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.singaporejews.com/">[67]</a> for details.
<b>Celiac disease</b> is relatively unheard of in Singapore, so don't expect to find information on menus about whether dishes contain gluten or not. A few exceptions to this include <b>Cedele</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.cedeledepot.com/">[68]</a> and <b>Barracks @ House</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.dempseyhouse.com/">[69]</a>.
Singapore's nightlife isn't quite a match for <a href="/en/Bangkok/Patpong" title="Bangkok/Patpong" class="mw-redirect">Patpong</a>, but it's no slouch either.  Some clubs have 24 hr licenses and few places close before 3AM.  Any artist touring Asia are pretty much guaranteed to stop in Singapore, with superclub <b>Zouk</b> in particular regularly clocking high on lists of the world's best nightclubs.  Singapore's nightlife is largely concentrated along the <b>three Quays</b> &#8212; Boat, Clarke and Robertson &#8212; of the <a href="/en/Singapore/Riverside" title="Singapore/Riverside">Riverside</a>, with the clubs of <a href="/en/Sentosa" title="Sentosa" class="mw-redirect">Sentosa</a> and nearby St James Power Station giving party animals even more reason to dance the night away.  Gay bars are mostly found around <a href="/en/Singapore/Chinatown" title="Singapore/Chinatown">Chinatown</a>.  Drinking age is 18, and while this is surprisingly loosely enforced, some clubs have higher age limits.
Friday is generally the biggest night of the week for going out, with Saturday a close second.  Sunday is gay night in many bars and clubs, while Wednesday or Thursday is ladies' night, often meaning not just free entrance but free drinks for women.  Most clubs are closed on Monday and Tuesday, while bars generally stay open but tend to be very quiet.
For a night out Singapore style, gather a group of friends and head for the nearest <b>karaoke box</b> &#8212; major chains include <b>K-Box</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.kbox.com.sg">[70]</a> and <b>Party World</b>.  Room rental ranges from $30/hour and up.  Beware that the non-chain, glitzy (or dodgy) looking, neon-covered <b>KTV lounges</b> may charge much higher rates and the short-skirted hostesses may offer more services than just pouring your drinks. In Singapore, the pronunciation of karaoke follows the Japanese "<i>karah-oh-kay</i>" instead of the Western "<i>carry-oh-key</i>".
Alcohol is widely available but very expensive due to Singapore's heavy sin taxes. You can bring in up to one litre of liquor and two litres of wine and beer if you arrive from countries other than Malaysia. Changi Airport has a good range of duty free spirits at reasonable prices, but cheap wine is non-existent, with bottles starting well over S$20. Careful shopping at major supermarkets will also throw up common basic Australian wine labels for under $20.
Alcohol is haram (forbidden) to Muslims, and most Muslim Singaporeans duly avoid it. While most non-Muslim Singaporeans are not puritanical and enjoy a drink every now and then, do not expect to find the binge-drinking culture that you will find in most Western countries. Unlike in most Western countries, public drunkenness in socially frowned upon in Singapore, and misbehaving yourself under the influence of alcohol will certainly not gain you any respect from Singaporean friends. Do not allow any confrontations to escalate into fights, as the police will be called in, and you will face jail time and possibly caning.
Prices when eating out vary. You can enjoy a large bottle of beer of your choice at a coffee shop or hawker centre for less than $6 (and the local colour comes thrown in for free). On the other hand, drinks in any bar, club or fancy restaurant remain extortionate, with a basic drink clocking in at $10-15 while fancy cocktails would usually be in the $15-25 range. On the upside, happy hours and two-for-one promotions are common, and the entry price for clubs usually includes several drink tickets. Almost all restaurants in Singapore allow <b>bringing your own</b> (BYO) wine and cheaper restaurants without a wine menu usually don't even charge corkage, although in these places you'll need to bring your own bottle opener and glasses.  Fancier places charge $20-50, although many offer free corkage days on Monday or Tuesday.
Tourists flock to the Long Bar in the <a href="/en/Singapore/Riverside#Drink" title="Singapore/Riverside">Raffles Hotel</a> to sample the original <b>Singapore Sling</b>, a sickly sweet pink mix of pineapple juice, gin and more, but locals (almost) never touch the stuff.  The tipple of choice in Singapore is the local beer, <b>Tiger</b>, a rather ordinary lager, but there's been a recent microbrewery boom with <b>Archipelago</b> (Boat Quay), <b>Brewerkz</b> (Riverside Point), <b>Paulaner Brauhaus</b> (Millenia Walk) and <b>Pump Room</b> (Clarke Quay) all offering interesting alternatives.
Tobacco is heavily taxed, and you are not allowed to bring more than <b>one opened pack</b> (not carton, but a single pack!) of cigarettes into the country.  This is particularly strictly enforced on the land borders with <a href="/en/Malaysia" title="Malaysia">Malaysia</a>.  Many public places including hawker centres have restrictions on smoking, and it is prohibited in public transport as well.  There is a total ban on smoking in all air-conditioned places (including pubs and discos), and strict limitations on where you can smoke outside as well (e.g., bus stops, parks, playgrounds and all except the designated sections of hawker centres are off limits). The designated zone should be marked with a yellow outline, and may have a sign reading "smoking zone".
Prostitution is tolerated in six designated districts, most notably <a href="/en/Singapore/East_Coast#Drink" title="Singapore/East Coast">Geylang</a>, which &#8212; not coincidentally &#8212; also offers some of the cheapest lodging and best food in the city. The industry maintains a low profile (no go-go bars here) and is not a tourist attraction by any stretch of the word. Legally practising commercial sex workers are required to register with the authorities and attend special clinics for regular sexually transmitted disease  screening. However, please be prudent and practice safe sex--although most sex workers will insist on it anyway.
Orchard Towers, on <a href="/en/Singapore/Orchard" title="Singapore/Orchard">Orchard Road</a>, has been famously summarized as "four floors of whores" and, despite occasional crackdowns by the authorities, continues to live up to its name.  Beware that the prostitutes working here are usually <i>not</i> registered, so the risk of theft and STDs is significantly higher. Some transgender women work at this establishment because the State does not allow them to obtain a license for sex work. Because they are considered illegal workers, they are subjected to constant raids, harassment, intimidation, imprisonment and other forms of degrading treatment and criminalization. They also face entrapment where police officers pretend to be customers.<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://theprojectx.org/?page_id=18">[71]</a>
Accommodation in Singapore is expensive by South-East Asian standards.  Particularly in the higher price brackets, demand has been outstripping supply recently and during big events like the F1 race or some of the larger conventions it's not uncommon for pretty much everything to sell out.  Lower-end hotels and hostels, though, remain affordable and available throughout the year.
Singapore's laws that ban late night/early morning construction only apply to residential areas and not the city centre.  You can expect to hear loud piling from sites such as the new <a class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_MRT_Line">Downtown MRT Line</a> tunnels late into the night or early morning. Keep this in mind and check for any construction work near any hotel you choose as the work will be unlikely to stop when you want to sleep!
Unless you're a shopping maven intent on maximizing time in <a href="/en/Singapore/Orchard#Sleep" title="Singapore/Orchard">Orchard Road</a>'s shopping malls, the <a href="/en/Singapore/Riverside#Sleep" title="Singapore/Riverside">Riverside</a> is probably the best place to stay in Singapore.
<a href="/en/Hostels" title="Hostels">Backpackers' hostels</a> can be found primarily in <a href="/en/Singapore/Little_India" title="Singapore/Little India">Little India</a>, <a href="/en/Singapore/Chinatown" title="Singapore/Chinatown">Chinatown</a>,<a href="/en/Singapore/Bugis" title="Singapore/Bugis">Bugis</a>,<a href="/en/Singapore/Riverside" title="Singapore/Riverside">Clarke Quay</a> and the <a href="/en/Singapore/East_Coast" title="Singapore/East Coast">East Coastat</a> about $25-40 for a dorm bed.
Cheap hotels are clustered in the <a href="/en/Singapore/East_Coast" title="Singapore/East Coast">Geylang</a>, <a href="/en/Singapore/Balestier" title="Singapore/Balestier">Balestier</a> and <a href="/en/Singapore/Little_India" title="Singapore/Little India">Little India</a> districts, where they service mostly the type of customer who rents rooms by the hour.  Rooms are generally small and not fancy, but are still clean and provide basic facilities like a bathroom and television. Prices start as low as $15 for a "transit" of a few hours and $40 for a full night's stay.
Much of Singapore's mid-range accommodation is in rather featureless but functional older hotels, with a notable cluster near the western end of the <a href="/en/Singapore/Riverside" title="Singapore/Riverside">Singapore River</a>.  There has, however, been a recent surge of "boutique" hotels in renovated shophouses here and in <a href="/en/Singapore/Chinatown" title="Singapore/Chinatown">Chinatown</a> and these can be pretty good value, with rates starting from $100/night.
Singapore has a wide selection of luxury accommodation, including the famed <b>Raffles Hotel</b>.  You will generally be looking at upwards of $300 per night for a room in a five-star hotel, which is still a pretty good deal by most standards. Hotel rates fluctuate quite a bit: a large conference can double prices, while on weekends in the off-peak season heavy discounts are often available. The largest hotel clusters can be found at <a href="/en/Singapore/Marina_Bay" title="Singapore/Marina Bay">Marina Bay</a> (good for sightseeing) and around <a href="/en/Singapore/Orchard" title="Singapore/Orchard">Orchard Road</a> (good for shopping).
Housing in Singapore is expensive, as the high population density and sheer scarcity of land drives real estate prices through the roof. As a result, you would generally be looking at rentals on par with the likes of <a href="/en/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York</a> and <a href="/en/London" title="London">London</a>.
Apartment hotels in Singapore have prices competitive with hotels but are quite expensive compared to apartments.
Renting an apartment in Singapore will generally require a working visa.  While over 80% of Singaporeans live in government-subsidized <b>Housing Development Board</b> (HDB) flats, their availability to visitors is limited, although JTC's SHiFT <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.jtc.gov.sg/">[72]</a> scheme makes some available with monthly rents in the $1700-2,800 range.
Most expats, however, turn to private housing blocks known as <b>condos</b>, where an average three-bedroom apartment will cost you anything from $3,200 per month for an older apartment in the suburbs to $20,000 for a top-of-the-line deluxe one on Orchard Road.  Most condos have facilities like pools, gyms, tennis court, car park and 24 hr security.  As the supply of studio and one-bedroom apartments is very limited, most people on a budget share an apartment with friends or colleagues, or just sublet a single room. Landed houses, known as <b>bungalows</b>, are incredibly expensive in the centre (rents are regularly measured in tens of thousands) but can drop if you're willing to head out into the woods &#8212; and remember that you can drive across the country in 30 minutes.
One or two-month security deposits are standard practice and for monthly rents of under $3,000 you need to pay the agent a commission of 2 weeks rent per year of the lease arranged. Leases are usually for two years, with a "diplomatic clause" that allows you to terminate after 1 year. Singapore Expats <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.singaporeexpats.com/">[73]</a> is the largest real estate agency geared for expatriates and their free classified ads are a popular choice for hunting for rooms or apartment-mates.  You might also want to check the classified ads in the local newspapers.
Singapore's universities are generally well-regarded and draw exchange students from near and far.
A number of foreign universities, business schools and specialised institutes have also setup their Asian campuses in Singapore.
Casual work is nearly impossible to come by, as you must have a <b>work permit</b> (WP) or <b>employment pass</b> (EP) to work in Singapore.  In practice, receiving either requires that you have a firm job offer and the sponsoring company applies on your behalf. There is also a <b>Working Holiday Programme</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.contactsingapore.sg/students/work/programmes/work_holiday_programme/">[89]</a> for recent university grads who want to live in Singapore for up to 6 months.
<b>Work permits</b> are mostly intended for menial, low-skilled labourers.  To be eligible for an <b>employment pass</b>, you would generally need to have a minimum salary of more than $2,500 per month and hold at least a bachelor degree from a reasonably reputable university. There is also an intermediate known as the <b>S pass</b>, which is usually granted to mid-skilled workers who have been promoted to positions of junior leadership such as worksite supervisor, and would require you to have a minimum salary of more than $1,800 per month as well as your employer's recommendation. <b>Employment pass</b> holders as well as <b>S pass</b> holders with a monthly salary of more than $2,500 are allowed to bring in their family members on a dependent pass.
If your employment is terminated, you will get a social visit pass (a visitors visa with no employment rights) which allows you to stay for no longer than 14 days. You can look for another job during this time, but don't overstay your visa, and do not think about working without the right papers, this will result in a short stay in the local prison, with added fines, possibly caning and certain deportation.  For more information, contact the Ministry of Manpower <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.mom.gov.sg/">[90]</a>.
Once you have been working in Singapore for a year or so with an <b>employment pass</b> or <b>S pass</b>, applying for <b>permanent residence</b> (PR) is fairly straightforward.  If granted &#8212; and the rule of thumb is, the higher your salary, the more likely you are to get it &#8212; you can stay in Singapore indefinitely (as long as you can show some income every 5 years) and can change jobs freely.
As one of the most vibrant economies in South-east Asia, and supported by a highly-educated population of locals and foreign talents, Singapore is a natural choice for multi-nationals who wish to have a presence in the region. The government is also highly supportive of entrepreneurship in the country, offering a full 3-year tax exemption on profit for new companies (for the first S$100,000) and having one of the lowest corporate tax rates in the world at 17% a year. Even the company incorporation process <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.company-registration.sg/">[91]</a> is done entirely online these days and can be completed as quickly as within a day.
Singapore is one of the <b>safest major cities in the world</b> by virtually any measure. Most people, including single female travellers, will not face any problems walking along the streets alone at night. But as the local police say, "low crime does not mean no crime" &#8212; beware of pickpockets in crowded areas and don't forget your common sense entirely.  Specifically, the areas around Clarke Quay and Arab Street are known to harbour violent gangs that target (generally) expatriate men in the early hours of the morning.
Singapore's squeaky cleanliness is achieved in part by strict rules against activities that are tolerated in other countries. For example, jay-walking, spitting, littering, and drinking and eating on public transport are prohibited. Locals joke about Singapore being a <b>fine city</b> because heavy fines are levied if one is caught committing an offense. Look around for sign boards detailing the Don'ts and the fines associated with these offenses, and heed them. Avoid <i>littering</i>, as offenders are not only subject to fines, but also to a "Corrective Work Order", in which offenders are made to wear a bright yellow jacket and pick up rubbish in public places. Enforcement is however sporadic at best, and it is not uncommon to see people openly litter, spit, smoke in non-smoking zones, etc. <b>Chewing gum</b>, famously long banned, is now available at pharmacies for medical purposes (e.g. nicotine gum) if you ask for it directly, show your ID and sign the register. While importing gum is still technically an offense, one can usually bring in a few packs for personal consumption without any problem.
For some crimes, most notably <b>illegal entry</b> and <b>overstaying your visa for over 90 days</b>, Singapore imposes <b>caning</b> as a punishment. Other offenses which have caning as a punishment include vandalism (just ask Michael P. Fay), robbery, molestation and rape. Do note that having sex with a girl under the age of 16 is considered to be rape under Singapore law, regardless of whether the girl consents to it and would land you a few strokes of the cane. This is no slap on the wrist: strokes from the thick rattan cane are excruciatingly painful, take weeks to heal and scar for life. Corruption is also punishable by caning so under no circumstances should you try to offer a bribe or gratuity to a police officer. Crimes such as murder, kidnapping, unauthorized possession of firearms and drug trafficking are punished with death.
Oral and anal sex, long banned under colonial-era sodomy statutes, were legalised for heterosexuals in October 2007. Homosexual contact, however, remains illegal, with a theoretical punishment two years in prison and/or caning. Though this law is rarely enforced and there is a fairly vibrant gay community, gays should still expect legalized discrimination and unaccepting attitudes from locals and government officials.
Begging is illegal in Singapore, but you'll occasionally see beggars on the streets.  Most are not Singaporean &#8212; even the "monks" dressed in robes, who occasionally pester tourists for donations, are usually bogus.
Whilst jaywalking is illegal, it is still a common thing and occurs quite often around the city. Beware though that if a police officer catches you, you might end up with a fine or in prison; even more serious, if you get hit by a bicycle rider or car, it is considered the pedestrian's fault when it isn't their right of way, and they might have to pay damage costs. Put simply: the roads are for the cars  and the footpaths are for people.
While Singapore provides a constitutional right to "freedom of expression", there are many exceptions that act to limit this right, including several exceptions related to speaking against the current government. Nevertheless, the police generally do not arrest people for expressing an anti-government views in casual conversation and articles critical of certain government policies are sometimes published in the local newspaper forums. Visitors need not be worried unless you plan to hold an anti-government rally or publish opinion pieces critical of the current leaders. Missionaries should also note that insulting other religions is a crime in Singapore, and carries fines and a prison sentence with it, so be sensitive when discussing subjects related to religion.
Politics, especially the immigration policy is a very sensitive subject - although police won't arrest you for discussing those with locals, Singapore has a peculiar political climate in which it's way too easy to step on a slippery slope when engaging in a discourse in those areas. Although locals themselves feel frustrated and displaced by the combination of mass immigration, their liability for the two year long National Service, some institutionalized discrimination and soaring property prices, they may paradoxically still take offense if you criticize any aspect of the country. Politics and social dynamics are a subject best avoided and if you happen to get drafted into it by a taxi driver, it's best to stay neutral and just listen.
Singapore is virtually immune to natural disasters: there are no fault lines nearby, although Indonesia's earthquakes can sometimes be barely felt, and other landmasses shield it from typhoons, tornadoes and tsunamis.  Flooding in the November-January monsoon season is an occasional hazard, especially in low-lying parts of the East Coast, but any water usually drains off within a day and life continues as normal.
Despite rigid regulations, road traffic remains rather erratic and reckless driving remains a large concern. If you choose to drive in the country, don't expect other motorists to give way, maintain lane discipline, keep a safe distance or signal when changing lanes. Although a failure to do all those carries large fines, the enforcement is very intermittent. Remain alert and cautious at all times.
<b>Tap water</b> is safe for drinking, and sanitation standards are very high.  As a tropical country, Singapore is hot and humid so drink a lot of water. The lowest temperature ever recorded in Singapore was way back in 1934, when it hit a low of 19.4Â°C (66.9Â°F).
<a href="/en/Malaria" title="Malaria">Malaria</a> is not an issue, but <a href="/en/Dengue_fever" title="Dengue fever">dengue fever</a> is endemic to the region. Singapore maintains strict mosquito control (leaving standing water around will get you fined), but the government's reach does not extend into the island's nature reserves, so if you're planning on hiking bring along mosquito repellent.
The standard of medical care in Singapore is <b>uniformly excellent</b> and Singapore is a popular destination for medical tourism (and medical evacuations) in the region. Despite the lower prices, standards are often as good as those in the West at both public and private clinics, making this a good place to get your jabs and tabs if heading off into the jungle elsewhere.  You'll still want to make sure your insurance is in order before a prolonged hospitalization and/or major surgery.
For minor ailments, head down to the nearest suburban shopping mall or HDB shopping district and look for a <b>general practitioner</b> (GP).  They usually receive patients without appointment and can prescribe drugs on the spot, and the total cost of a consultation, medicine included, rarely exceeds $30. For larger problems, head to a hospital.
Alternatively, practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) are widespread in Singapore.  <b>Eu Yan Sang</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.euyansang.com/">[96]</a> runs a chain of over 20 clinics, while the <b>Singapore Chinese Physicians' Association</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.singaporetcm.edu.sg">[97]</a> offers a directory of TCM physicians.
Nearly all shopping centres, hotels, MRT stations, bus interchanges, and hawker centres are likely to have public toilets. Being clean, McDonald's toilets are popular too, and the staff do not make a fuss. Public facilities may charge 10 to 20 cents per entry, and a packet of tissue may come in handy if the toilet paper has run out. Most toilets have bowls, but there is usually one squatting cubicle in every public toilet.
<b>What's in a name?</b><br />
- <b>Chinese</b> place their family name first, so <i>Phua Chu Kang</i> is Mr. Phua for business and Chu Kang (or just CK) to his friends. Many have Western names, so he may also be known as <i>Terry Phua</i>.<br />
- <b>Malay</b> names are given name + <i>bin</i> or <i>binti</i> (son/daughter) + father's name. <i>Mohammed bin Abdullah</i> would usually be called Mr. Mohammed. Sometimes, the person's given name appears after the Mohammed (example: <i>Mohammed Faizal bin Mohammed Nasser</i>) so, in such a case, he would usually be addressed as Mr. Faizal.<br />
- <b>Indian</b> names are complex, but the south Indian (Tamil) names usually found in Singapore have two patterns: either given name + <i>s/o</i> or <i>d/o</i> (son of/daughter of) + father's name, or father's initial + given name. Given names are often long and may be abbreviated, so Ramanathan s/o Sellapan uses the name S.R. Nathan and would addressed as Mr. Nathan. The foolproof method is to ask how the person wants to be addressed.
Singaporeans care little about formal politeness. What would be decent behavior at home, wherever home might be, is unlikely to offend anyone in Singapore. In Singapore, unlike much of southeast Asia, women wearing revealing clothing or men wearing shorts and slippers are perfectly acceptable. That said, upmarket bars and restaurants may enforce dress codes and Singaporeans tend to be more socially conservative than Westerners, meaning that public display of affection is still frowned upon and toplessness for women is not acceptable anywhere, even on the beach.
People are generally friendlier in the heartlands, and it is not uncommon to see shopkeepers and customers of multiple races bantering. However, Singaporeans, while not hostile towards foreigners, are generally not overly receptive to any overbearing friendliness from them. Furthermore, the local dialect with its heavy Chinese influences may appear brusque or even rude, but saying "You want beer or not?" is in fact <i>more</i> polite in Chinese than asking if you want beer; after all, the person asking you the question is offering you a choice, not making a demand.
If invited to somebody's house, always remove your shoes before you enter as most Singaporeans do not wear their shoes at home. Socks are perfectly acceptable though, as long as they are not excessively soiled. Many places of worship also require you to remove your shoes before you enter.
At rush hour, be prepared for a lot of pushing on the MRT (even just to get off) and everyone racing for the empty seat, though in a somewhat orderly manner. This is normal, despite signs asking people to be a little more courteous. Just go with the flow.
Beware of taboos if bringing gifts. Any products (food or otherwise) involving animals may cause offence and are best avoided, as are white flowers (usually reserved for funerals). Knives and clocks are also symbols of cutting ties and death, respectively, and some Chinese are superstitious about the number four. Also note that in Singapore, it is considered rude to open a gift in front of the person who gave it to you. Instead, wait till the person has left and open it in private. Many Singaporean Muslims and some Hindus abstain from alcohol.
Swastikas are commonly seen in Buddhist and Hindu temples, as well as among the possessions of Buddhists and Hindus. It is regarded as a religious symbol and does <i>not</i> represent Nazism or anti-Semitism. As such, Western visitors should not feel offended on seeing a swastika in the homes of their hosts, and many locals will wonder what the fuss is all about.
Take <a href="#Eat">dietary restrictions</a> into account when inviting Singaporean friends for a meal. Many Indians (and a few Chinese) are vegetarian. Most Malays, being Muslims, eat only <i>halal</i> food, while most Indians, being Hindu, abstain from beef.
Singaporeans are punctual, so show up on time. The standard greeting is a firm handshake. However, conservative Muslims avoid touching the opposite sex, so a man meeting a Malay woman should let her offer her hand first and a woman meeting a Malay man should wait for him to offer his hand.  If they opt to place their hand on the heart and bow slightly instead, just follow suit. Singaporeans generally do not hug, especially if it is someone they have just met, and doing so would probably make your host feel awkward, though the other person will probably be too polite to say anything as saving face is a major Asian value.
For men, standard business attire is a long-sleeved shirt and a tie, although the tie is often omitted, the shirt's collar button opened instead. Jackets are rarely worn because it is too hot most of the time. Women usually wear Western business attire, but a few prefer Malay-style <i>kebaya</i> and <i>sarong</i>.
Business cards are always exchanged when people meet for business for the first time: hold yours with both hands by the top corners, so the text faces the recipient, while simultaneously receiving theirs. (This sounds more complicated than it is.) Study the cards you receive and feel free to ask questions; when you are finished, place them on the table in front of you, <i>not</i> in a shirt pocket or wallet, and do not write on them or otherwise show disrespect.
Business gifts are generally frowned on as they smell of bribery. Small talk and bringing up the subject indirectly are neither necessary nor expected. Most meetings get straight down to business.
The international telephone country code for Singapore is <b>65</b>. There are three main telecommunication providers in Singapore: <b>SingTel</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.singtel.com/">[98]</a>, <b>StarHub</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.starhub.com/">[99]</a> and <b>MobileOne</b> (M1) <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.m1.com.sg/">[100]</a>.
<b>Mobile phones</b> are carried by almost everyone in Singapore, including many young children, and coverage is generally excellent throughout the country. All 3 service providers have both GSM 900/1800 and 3G (W-CDMA) networks, and international roaming onto them may be possible; check with your operator before you leave to be sure. Prepaid SIM cards are sold in 7-Eleven convenience stores, phone shops and currency exchange counters, just bring your own GSM/3G phone or buy a cheap used handset in Singapore. You will need to show an international passport or Singapore ID to sign up.
A local phone call costs between $0.05-$0.25 per min, whereas each local text message (SMS) costs about $0.05, with international SMS about $0.15-$0.25 (but a few dozen local SMS are usually thrown in for free when you top up).  You may also be charged for incoming calls.  Most prepaid cards expire within 6 mth unless you top-up (which can be done outside Singapore). 
The carriers also offer special top up cards that will give a higher number of minutes for the price at the downside of expiring more quickly.
As in many places, mobile data with on prepaid voice SIM cards can be ridiculously expensive.
StarHub offers a 1GB package (valid for 30 days). It costs $25 and is aimed at BlackBerrys but works with any phone. Using the StarHub SIM, call *122# and follow the menu to activate.
Data-only SIMs can be more affordable.
For short stays, StarHub has 2Mbps unlimited service at S$15 per week. For longer stays, bring a MicroSIM adapter and you can get StarHub's 2GB package (good for 60 days) for $37.
<b>Public phones</b> are an increasingly endangered species, but you can find them in most MRT stations. They are either coin-operated pay phones (10 cents for a three-minute local call), card phones operated by phone cards in denominations of $3, $5, $10, $20 and $50, or credit card phones. Phone cards are available at all post offices and from phonecard agents. Most coin-operated pay phones are for local calls only, there are some which accept coins of larger denominations and can be used for overseas calls. Credit card phones are usually found at the airport or in some major hotels.
To make an <b>international call</b> from Singapore, dial the access code 001 (for SingTel), 002 (for M1), and 008 (for StarHub), followed by the country code, area code and party's number. Recently the providers have started offering cheaper rates for calls using Internet telephony routes. The access codes for this cheaper service are 019 and 013 for SingTel and 018 for StarHub, make sure you input these codes instead of the "+" sign at the beginning of the number if you wish to use these services.
<b>Calling cards</b> are also available for specific international destinations and are usually cheaper. Hello Card from Singtel offers a very cheap rate to 8 countries (<a href="/en/Bangladesh" title="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a>, <a href="/en/China" title="China">China</a>, <a href="/en/India" title="India">India</a>, <a href="/en/Indonesia" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>, <a href="/en/Myanmar" title="Myanmar">Myanmar</a>, <a href="/en/Philippines" title="Philippines">Philippines</a>, <a href="/en/Sri_Lanka" title="Sri Lanka">Sri Lanka</a> and <a href="/en/Thailand" title="Thailand">Thailand</a>).
<b>Internet cafes</b> charging around $2/hr are scattered about the island, but are not particularly common since almost all locals have Internet access at home, work, and/or school.  Head to <a href="/en/Singapore/Chinatown" title="Singapore/Chinatown">Chinatown</a> or <a href="/en/Singapore/Little_India" title="Singapore/Little India">Little India</a> if you need get online, or check out the top floors of many suburban malls, which feature Internet cafes doubling as online gaming parlors.  Alternatively, all public libraries <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.nlb.gov.sg/">[101]</a> offer cheap Internet access ($0.03/min or $1.80/hr), but you need to jump through registration hoops to get access.
The first phase of the nationwide free <b>Wireless@SG</b> system is now operating and visitors are free to use the system, although you must register and receive a password via e-mail or a mobile phone first.  See the Infocomm Development Authority website <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.ida.gov.sg/">[102]</a> for a current list of hotspots.  Commercial alternatives include McDonalds, which offers free wifi at most outlets; StarHub, a member of the Wireless Broadband Alliance with hotspots at Coffee Bean cafes; and SingTel, which has hotspots at most Starbucks cafes.  Roaming or prepaid rates are on the order of $0.10/min.
There are several options for prepaid 3G/HSPA internet. Starhub MaxMobile <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.starhub.com/broadband/mobilebroadband/maxmobileprepaid.html">[103]</a> has different plans from S$2/hour to S$25 for 5 days unlimited 7.2mbps internet. SIM costs S$12. M1 Prepaid Broadband offers unlimited Internet access for three days/five days at S$18/S$30 <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://m1.com.sg/M1/site/M1Corp/">[104]</a>.
Mobile internet access is also available from the different telecoms which offer hundreds of megabytes good for several days.  However do try using the free WiFi access if possible; not only will it save you money but also precious battery life.
<b>SingPost</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.singpost.com.sg/">[105]</a> has offices throughout the island, generally open 8:30AM-5PM weekdays, 8:30AM-1PM Saturdays, closed Sundays.  The Changi Airport T2 (transit side) office is open 6 AM-midnight daily, while the 1 Killeney Rd branch is open until 9 PM weekdays and 10AM-4PM Sundays. Service is fast and reliable. A postcard to anywhere in the world costs 50 cents, and postage labels can also be purchased from the self-service SAM machines found in many MRT stations.
Small packets up to 2 kg cost $3.50/100g for airmail, or $1/100g for surface mail.  For larger packages, DHL <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.dhl.com.sg/">[106]</a> may offer competitive rates.
Singapore uses the British BS1363 three-pin rectangular socket (230V/50Hz).  Plug adaptors are available at any hardware store.
Singapore is a good place to collect visas for the region.  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.mfa.gov.sg">[107]</a> maintains a complete searchable database of diplomatic institutions.
Singaporeans are particular about their hair and there is no shortage of fancy hair salons charging from $20 up for the latest Chinese popstar look. If you are willing to splurge, there is Passion Hair Salon at Palais Renaissance with celebrity hairstylist David Gan (hairstylist of Zhang Ziyi and other famous celebrities) doing the haircut. Le Salon at Ngee Ann City offers haircuts up to $2000. The middle range hair salons located in town or in the heartlands, offer haircuts with hair wash as well as other frills. Chains include Reds Hairdressing, Supercuts and Toni and Guy salons that are located all over Singapore. For a more backpacker-friendly price, almost every shopping mall in Singapore has a branch of <b>EC House</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.ec-house.com.sg/">[155]</a> or one of its many imitators, offering fuss-free 10 min haircuts for $10, although the hairdressers are mostly happy to spend as long as necessary on your hair, within reasonable limits. Most HDB estates have barbershops which charge $5 to $10 for adults and less for students and children.
Laundromats are few and far between in Singapore, but full-service laundry and dry cleaning shops can be found in every shopping mall.  Unfortunately turnaround times are usually upwards of three days unless you opt for express service. Hotels can provide one-day laundry (at a price), whereas hostels often have communal self-service washing machines.
Practically every shopping mall has a photo shop that will process film, print digital pictures and take passport photos. Many pharmacies and supermarkets also have self-service kiosks which print digital photos from CD, SD-card, USB drive, etc.
The <b>Singapore Sports Council</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.ssc.gov.sg/">[158]</a> runs a chain of affordable sports facilities, often featuring fantastic outdoor 50 m pools (see <a href="/en/Singapore#Swimming" title="Singapore">Swimming</a> for a list).  Facilities are somewhat sparse but the prices are unbeatable, with e.g. swimming pools charging $1 for entry and access to ClubFITT gyms only $2.50. The main downside is the inconvenient location of most facilities out in the suburbs, although most are located close to an MRT station and can be reached within 10-20 min from the city centre. The gyms also ban bringing in any reading material (aimed at students but enforced blindly), although MP3 players are OK.
Major private gym chains include <b>California Fitness</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.californiafitness.com">[159]</a>, <b>Fitness First</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.fitnessfirst.com.sg/">[160]</a> and <b>True Fitness</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.truefitness.com.sg/">[161]</a>.  Facilities are better and locations more central, but the prices are also much higher as non-members have to fork out steep day pass fees (around $40).
Some of the <b>parks</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.nparks.gov.sg/">[162]</a> offer rental of bicycles and inline skates ($3-6/hr, open till 8PM). You can either rent skates, attend a skate class or send the children off to a skate camp at major parks like West Coast and East Coast Park. You can even get skating lessons from popular skate schools like <b>inline fitness</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.inlinefitness.org/">[163]</a>  or <b>skate with us, a skate school for children</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.skate-with-us.com/">[164]</a>  Especially rewarding for skaters and cyclists is the 10 km long stretch along <a href="/en/Singapore/East_Coast" title="Singapore/East Coast">East Coast Park</a> with a paved track and lots of rental shops, bars and cafes around the McDonalds. There are toilets and showers along the track. Furthermore every park has a couple of fitness stations.
Singapore makes a good base for exploring South-East Asia, with nearly all of the region's countries and their main tourist destinations &#8212; <a href="/en/Bangkok" title="Bangkok">Bangkok</a>, <a href="/en/Phuket" title="Phuket">Phuket</a>, <a href="/en/Angkor_Wat" title="Angkor Wat" class="mw-redirect">Angkor Wat</a>, <a href="/en/Ho_Chi_Minh_City" title="Ho Chi Minh City">Ho Chi Minh City</a> and <a href="/en/Bali" title="Bali">Bali</a>, just to name a few &#8212; under 2 hr away by plane. The advent of budget carriers in recent times means that Singapore is an excellent place for catching cheap flights to China and India, as well as around Southeast Asia. In addition, Singapore has direct flights to many of the smaller cities in <a href="/en/Malaysia" title="Malaysia">Malaysia</a>, <a href="/en/Indonesia" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a> and <a href="/en/Thailand" title="Thailand">Thailand</a>.
