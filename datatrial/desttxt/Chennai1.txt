It is on the Coromandel coast of the Bay of Bengal and has the second longest beachfront of any municipality in the world.
Long the site of earlier coastal settlements, Madras was founded in 1639 when the British East India Company (represented by Francis Day and Andrew Cogan and aided by a local translator Beri Thimappa) was granted land to build a trading settlement by the local Telugu ruler (Nayak) of the suburb of Vandavasi, Damerla Venkatapathy Naidu on his father's name Damerla Chennappa Naidu. The document of the land grant is dated 22 August 1639, and hence Madras celebrates its birthday on 22 August each year as Madras day.  Madras was one of the first outposts of British East India Company. Colonel William Lambton, superintendent of the great Trigonometrical Survey of India, started his journey of triangulating India from St. Thomas Mount. The British built <b>Fort St. George</b> (today the legislative and administrative seat of the state). Fort St George was completed on St George's day in 1640 (23 April) and hence was named after the patron saint. George Town then developed becoming the modern city of Madras, absorbing several nearby boroughs. Thomas, one of the twelve apostles of Jesus Christ, is associated with Chennai. He is said to have come to India as an evangelist and died in what is now Chennai. Two suburbs, Santhome and St. Thomas Mount, are named in his memory.
In 1996, the Tamilnadu government renamed Madras to Chennai providing the reason that 'Chennai' was the city's traditional name while Madras was one derived during colonial rule.
Madras is derived from <i>Madraspatnam</i>, a name given to the area when the British negotiated settling there with Damerla Venkatapathy Nayakudu. The origin of the name is from Muthuraja Chennappa Nayakudu as Chennapatnam.Chennappa served under Sriranga Deva Raya assisting him against the Golkonda forces of Ibrahim Qutb Shah in several battles,notably in 1576 when Penukonda was captured by Ali Adil Shah and in 1579 when he captured the Golkonda Commander Murari Rao.
In 1580, Ibrahim Qutb Shah of Golkonda invaded Kondavidu. Later he took the Udayagiri Fort and began to massacre the locals. However he was defeated after a brief fight with the Raya's army. Qutb Shah later took the fort of Vinukonda. Sriranga defeated the Sultan's forces with the assistance of his generals muthuraja Chennappa[damarla was his surname] and Kasturiranga. During this fight, Chennappa lost his life. He was succeeded by Kasturiranga. When East India Company was established the St.George fort in the present day Chennai, for which the permission was granted by Damarla Venkatadri Nayakudu,the local palegar of that area ,under the condition that area is to be named in the honour of his father Muthuraja chennapa nayakudu as muthuraja chennapatanam.The East India Company in brief named the area as madras[madras is a corrupt form of muthuraj].In earlier days this area was called as madraspattanam and also chennapatnam. Later Govt. of Tamil Nadu renamed it as Chennai. Some elder population still refer to the city as Madras but the name Chennai has caught up with much of the population.
Under the British, the then city of Madras grew to be a major city, It was the capital of the Madras presidency, a province that covered the parts of <a href="/en/Southern_India" title="Southern India">Southern India</a> that were not governed by any of the other princely states. After independence, it became the capital of the Madras state, and when the states were reorganized on a linguistic basis, it became the capital of Tamil Nadu.
Chennai boasts of many well known people including  Elihu Yale, whose  liberal gift funded the construction of Yale University in 1718; Indira Nooyi CEO of Pepsi International; A.R. Rahman, the musical genius  of "Slumdog Millionaire", Manirathnam the ace film Director, Vijay Armirthraj, Ramesh Krishnan and his father Ramanathan Krishnanm tennis stars and World chess champion Vishwanathan Anand among many others.
Chennai is gateway to the South, and its culture is distinctly different from that of any other city in India. Tamil tradition and culture are indigenous to this region and is essentially the celebration of the beauty, which is exemplified through dance, clothing, and sculptures. Chennai is both an orthodox and a modern cosmopolitan city; the culture of the city reflects its diverse population. The traditional arts, music, dance and all other art forms of Tamilnadu grow and flourish here.  The food is a unique blend of traditional, to fast foods and filter kaapi. Itâs a land of temples and priests. The architecture ranges from ancient temples to modern high-rises.  Music is classical and western, to the growing nightlife in the city. You can find a school for traditional Bharatanatyam or Salsa dance and for music a veena / violin or for Guitar/drums school in almost every neighborhood of the city. Chennai checks reflects its traditionalism every December when the music season is in full swing. Clothes are generally conservative but young people are contemporary.
Climate of Chennai is Tropical.
Chennai is situated in the Thermal Equator zone which prevents extreme changes in temperature. Chennai has mainly two seasons - summer (35-42&#176;C / 95-108&#176;F) Apr-Jun (Highest temperature ever recorded is 45&#176;C / 113&#176;F on 30 May 2003) and monsoon (Oct-Dec). It receives scanty rainfall from the south-west monsoon (Jun-Sep) while rest of India is lashed by heavy rains, but gets its bountiful rains from the <b>north-east monsoon</b> from October through December, thus amounting to about 125-150 cm (49-59 in) of rainfall annually. Rainfalls occur usually from October to December and dried up scrub lands bloom with greenery during this period.
December to February are the mildest months temperature - (19-28&#176;C / 66-82&#176;F). December to March is probably the best time to visit Chennai: the temperatures rarely exceed 30&#176;C during midday and evenings are pleasant.
Climate is humid pretty much throughout the year because the city is on the coast. Summers are very hot and humid. Be sure take along light (not flimsy) clothing. Winter fashion has never been of any use in Chennai, wearing a sweater will leave you drenched in sweat in less than five minutes.
<b>Books on or set in Chennai include</b>:
<b><a href="/en/Tamil_phrasebook" title="Tamil phrasebook">Tamil</a></b> is the official language in Chennai, and also the first language of most locals. Almost all people speak Tamil, a classical language. Picking up some knowledge of the local language is useful to get by in Chennai as in every city in the world. However, knowledge of English is sufficient for the average visitor to the city. English education is widespread in Chennai . All educated people in Chennai can speak  English while few understand simple English and can speak a few words. All important signboards are in English. All transactions with commercial establishments are  in English. The English accent is different, there is a tendency to end sentences and words with -uh (Eg: I'm going there-uh.) and interrogative sentences with -ah (Eg: You are going there-ah?).
Unlike other major cities in India, <a href="/en/Hindi_phrasebook" title="Hindi phrasebook">Hindi</a> is <i>not</i> widely understood. While there has been a significant increase in Hindi speakers in recent years, most locals will find it difficult to understand when you try to speak to them in Hindi. You are better off speaking English than Hindi in most southern cities <b>except</b> <a href="/en/Bangalore" title="Bangalore">Bangalore</a>.
Those native to Chennai and its suburbs speak the language of Tamil with a characteristic accent. Due to the proximity of the city to the State of Andhra Pradesh (where the official language is Telugu) and the presence of a sizeable quasi Telugu speaking population in the city, there is heavy borrowing of Telugu words into the vocabulary of 'Chennai Tamil'.'Chennai Tamil' is popularly known as <b>Madras Bashai</b>. Another characteristic of Chennai Tamil is that the words are spoken fast, possibly in line with the fast-paced life in Chennai when compared with the rest of the state. However, the Chennai accent does not go well with many Tamils. At best, Chennai Tamil could be termed 'crude'. Nevertheless, all educated people are taught standard Tamil in school, and standard Tamil is still used in more formal settings as well as in the news.

The cheapest way to the city is by taking the suburban train into the city which only costs â¹ 12 ($0.2,â¬0.16). The suburban train connects you to Chennai Central and Egmore, the two main passenger train stations. Check your destination though, either before getting to Chennai or at the information desk. It may be impractical to take the suburban train. This is best if you don't have large amounts of baggage. You have to exit the airport and walk a considerable distance (~500m) to reach the station "Tirusulam". Tickets bought don't have to be validated but save the ticket in case there is an inspection. The Chennai Metro is under construction and expected to open in 2014. 
It is advisable to take a first class ticket in the train if you happen to reach the airport during peak hours. The general compartments are often over-crowded as they transport regular commuters to work. In peak hours even the first class compartments may also be crowded. Tickets are priced around â¹70 ($1.27,â¬0.96).
Otherwise, use the pre-paid taxi booth.  Aviation Express is massively overpriced.
Using the <b>pre-paid taxi</b> to get to the city, each terminal has several booths for several taxi companies when you exit the airport, outside before you meet the crowd.  <b>Fast Track</b> has the best rep, figure on around <a href="/en/Indian_rupee" title="Indian rupee"><img alt="Indian rupee" src="http://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/5/56/Indian_Rupee_symbol.png/7px-Indian_Rupee_symbol.png" width="7" height="10" style="vertical-align: baseline" /></a>550 to the city centre for a minivan.  The fares are different for the domestic and international terminals though the terminals are next to each other. You can either choose the standard Taxis (Black with Yellow tops) which are usually the ancient Ambassador cars or the private call-taxi (which can come in any model and in any color). As in any Indian airport, you will be immediately haggled for transportation with promised offerings of the best price. A firm No should make them lose interest, ignore them if they continue harrassing you. It's better to keep small change in hand while paying at the counters. Note the taxi number written on your charge slip (one copy is for the passenger and the other is for the driver to collect the fare from the counter). Make your way to the taxi stand and get the taxi number allotted at the designated desk. The helpful drivers offer to take your luggage and guide you to the taxi that drives up quickly near the allotment desk.
A new cab provider named "Fasttrack" has started off their service and a pre-paid booth of them is available at both domestic and international terminals. Comparing with the rest of the taxis their fare and service is pretty much good. Depending on the number of persons and the luggage, you can hire anything from a city car to a mini van.
Prepaid and yellow top taxis are not air-conditioned, are of vintages right from 70s and 80s, rickety, prone to stop midway, drivers exhibit rough behaviour, sometimes could be dangerous, demand exorbitant fares, pre-paid may mean nothing and they may demand more when you get down. Keep away from these types. Or know that you can always negotiate. Typical ride into the farthest part of the city shouldn't cost more than â¹1000 by local standards.
Chennai has two main long-distance train stations, <b>Chennai Central</b> (code MAS) and <b>Chennai Egmore</b> (code MS). Both are connected to the Airport by the Suburban rail and to the Bus Terminus by City buses. Central has daily trains from/to <a href="/en/Bangalore" title="Bangalore">Bangalore</a>, <a href="/en/Mumbai" title="Mumbai">Mumbai</a>, <a href="/en/Coimbatore" title="Coimbatore">Coimbatore</a>, <a href="/en/Delhi" title="Delhi">Delhi</a>, <a href="/en/Hyderabad" title="Hyderabad">Hyderabad</a> , <a href="/en/Kolkata" title="Kolkata">Kolkata</a> , <a href="/en/Ahmedabad" title="Ahmedabad">Ahmedabad</a>   and virtually all other major Indian cities.Egmore has trains which cover all the places in Tamil Nadu and also a few important places outside it.
You can arrive at the prepaid taxi/auto stand and book a cab to transport you to your place of stay.
Many long distance trains to Egmore stop at Tambaram (code TBM) and some trains to Central stop at Perambur (code PER).These are two railway stations which serve the suburban areas of Chennai.

Seven different state owned corporations drive buses to and from various destinations within <a href="/en/South_India" title="South India" class="mw-redirect">South India</a>. Connected to the Airport and the passenger train stations (Chennai Central and Egmore) by direct buses, it offers a cheap and spontaneous mode of travel.

Several private players also operate buses between most southern destinations. During the weekends most buses are fully occupied and it's better to reserve a ticket in advance. All buses terminate near Koyambedu but there are different stands for state owned (CMBT <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.madurainews.com/chennai/Bus_Schedule_from_Chennai_Terminus.html">[8]</a>), and private buses (Omni bus terminus). Both these terminus are near each other, and it is better to tell your exact destination to the taxi/auto-rickshaw driver. Buses usually drop passengers at various points in the city before reaching the Terminus  <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.madurainews.com/chennai/Bus_Schedule_from_Chennai_Terminus.html">[9]</a>. Feel free to ask the driver or fellow passengers the closest drop-off point to your destination.
Always ask for the ticket and carry it until the end of your journey. Conning is very rare.
Chennai is very well connected and to other parts of India by road. Five major national highways radiate outward towards Kolkata, Bengaluru, <a href="/en/Tiruchy" title="Tiruchy" class="mw-redirect">Tiruchy</a>/<a href="/en/Madurai" title="Madurai">Madurai</a>, <a href="/en/Tiruvallur" title="Tiruvallur">Tiruvallur</a>, and Pondicherry. With the progress of the <b>Golden Quadrilateral</b> project, driving down from Bangalore is an option too. Indian drivers will have no problem fitting into the traffic but international drivers are strongly advised against driving in India. Rules are not really rules and lane switchings happen without any notice.
Getting around the heart of Chennai city often takes time, due to traffic and heavy congestion, more so because of construction work in progress for Chennai Metro. So it is advisable to plan your journey accordingly. Travelling within Chennai is not so cheap by Indian metropolitan standards, and are quite cheap by European and USA standards. As for foreigners, it is safe to wear a mask during traveling by motorcycles as pollution is bit of a concern.

Chennai has a suburban train <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.sr.indianrailways.gov.in/view_section.jsp?lang=0&amp;id=0,2,325">[10]</a> network. There are four routes:
Few trains on Western and North Line originate from Chennai Beach instead of Chennai Central.
The Chennai Beach - Tambaram/ Chengalpet is the most used line, it takes you from the city to Vandalur Zoo for a getaway. The suburban trains are generally reliable and fast but they were built more for practical purposes of commuting than connecting tourist attractions. Unless you know your destination for sure, check with locals or information desks for the quickest way to reach your destination. The frequency of suburban trains is generally good and it is advisable to take a first class ticket during peak hours. Trains offer a reliable alternative to quickly reach your destination when compared to buses which might get trapped in traffic jams. The fare in Chennai suburban trains is the lowest in the country and you don't have to compromise comfort for the meagre amount that you pay as in other Indian metros. The lowest second class train fare is Rs.5/-. <b>Always keep your baggage safe when you are travelling in the suburban railway system</b>.
Chennai Central (hub for north and west suburban lines) is opposite to Park Town (MRTS line) and Park (South Suburban line) - These 3 stations make an interchange trio - the highest interchange between suburban lines happens in this zone.
<b>Metropolitan Transport Corporation(MTC)</b> buses ply throughout the city accessing areas which are not accessed by the suburban trains. These are government-run and extremely cheap.
Chennai has few major termini from where the majority of the buses ply towards the rest of the city. More information can be had here <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://busroutes.in/chennai/">[11]</a>
Normally Bus Fare in MTC range from <a href="/en/Indian_rupee" title="Indian rupee"><img alt="Indian rupee" src="http://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/5/56/Indian_Rupee_symbol.png/7px-Indian_Rupee_symbol.png" width="7" height="10" style="vertical-align: baseline" /></a>4 - <a href="/en/Indian_rupee" title="Indian rupee"><img alt="Indian rupee" src="http://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/5/56/Indian_Rupee_symbol.png/7px-Indian_Rupee_symbol.png" width="7" height="10" style="vertical-align: baseline" /></a>50. Deluxe and A/C Buses are also operated on major routes. Fare for deluxe bus is almost two times as compared to normal bus. For same route, deluxe and normal bus have same number but deluxe buses are being run targeting long distance journey since it will stop at major bus stops only. So if you find normal buses too crowded, take a deluxe one. Non AC deluxe also have power gates and better suspension which you wont find in normal bus. If you have luggage with you, you might have to pay the cost of an extra person depending upon its size. A simple way of identifying the category of the bus is this: White Display Board - Standard Service, Yellow Display Board/LED- Deluxe Service, A/C Service- You will know when you look at it.
AC bus run by MTC chennai which run between important routes like Parrys - Tambaram, Parrys - CMBT, Chennai Central - CMBT, Chennai central - Tambaram, etc. Most frequent AC bus runs between CMBT towards Pondicherry and are known as East coast road (ECR) buses and is very comfortable for intracity travel too.
If you are getting into a bus from Chennai central railway station you can either catch a bus just in front of railway station or you can take the subway to cross the road and get it from the bus stop in front of government hospital.
Bus Route information for MTC Chennai is available online at official site<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.mtcbus.org/">[12]</a>, jaanlo<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://jaanlo.com/howto/how-to-get-bus-route-information-mtc-chennai/">[13]</a>, desiroutes<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.desiroutes.com/chennai">[14]</a> and rab<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://rab.in/bus/chennai">[15]</a>.

Auto-rickshaw/Tuk-tuk drivers in Chennai do not use meters; some try to overcharge and often drive rashly, but that's part of the fun of being in Chennai. They are happy to exploit foreigners and locals alike. The advantage of being a local is that you know when you're being fleeced, and so you'll know when to walk away and find another auto.
The upside is that autos are ubiquitous and possibly the easiest form of transportation to locate. Use Auto-rickshaws only for short distances because they are uncomfortable. Before talking to an auto driver you might like to try and ask any local person what the actual fare should be, because the drivers will often ask for up to 3 times more. Even so, by Western standards, they are dirt cheap. You'll have no problem once the fare has been agreed and for short trips the Auto is a must.
As a general rule, expect to pay about â¹10 to â¹15 for every kilometer (0.6 mi) you travel.
<b>Share autos</b> have emerged in the recent years as an alternative mode of transport in Chennai. They are over-sized three/four wheelers charge slightly more than the bus but way lesser than a regular auto. Likewise they are faster than the buses but slower than the autos. There are four wheelers known as <b>meter taxis</b>, which don't have a meter and are not taxis. They supplement the existing bus services and sometimes operate on routes based on popular demand.
On a side note - if you are fascinated by the idea of going around in an auto, think about all those foreigners, who are riding an auto from Chennai to Mumbai. 
A Chennai based event management company, Chennai Event Management Services, has been having these auto-rickshaw rallies from Chennai to Mumbai, or Kanyakumari, etc.,
and has developed a great fan following for the same. More info: <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.autorickshawchallenge.com">[18]</a>
Taxis (locally called "call-taxis" since they must be pre-arranged) are available by phone. Since there are so many listed in thr phone book already and they are mostly reliable we don't list any. They can be ordered air-conditioned and have digital fare meters, although time-based hire is also possible with some companies.  Most companies charge a minimum fare of <a href="/en/Indian_rupee" title="Indian rupee"><img alt="Indian rupee" src="http://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/5/56/Indian_Rupee_symbol.png/7px-Indian_Rupee_symbol.png" width="7" height="10" style="vertical-align: baseline" /></a>100/-(Non-AC)/150/-(AC), which is for 4km (2.4 mile) and for every subsequent kilometre they charge <a href="/en/Indian_rupee" title="Indian rupee"><img alt="Indian rupee" src="http://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/5/56/Indian_Rupee_symbol.png/7px-Indian_Rupee_symbol.png" width="7" height="10" style="vertical-align: baseline" /></a>12/- or 13/-.
Alternatively, you can hire a car for a half/full day for around <a href="/en/Indian_rupee" title="Indian rupee"><img alt="Indian rupee" src="http://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/5/56/Indian_Rupee_symbol.png/7px-Indian_Rupee_symbol.png" width="7" height="10" style="vertical-align: baseline" /></a>1200/1500.  These figures are for basic models,add about 50% if you want the comfort of higher-end models.  If your trip is time-sensitive, it's best to book your taxi a few hours in advance and call shortly before your trip to confirm. However, there is every possibility of your not getting one in spite of advance booking as they book without any planning/system and ditch the customers in the last minute. A proper system of confirmed allotment at least 45 min prior to the scheduled time (like in Delhi/other cities) is what is required for Chennai.
There are many car rental companies available.
Car rental agencies such as BookCab, Clear Car Rental,Cabs24x7, Avis, Chennai Cabs and Hertz.
It is generally not advisable for foreign travelers to drive on their own as they might be unaware of the traffic rules and congestion in the city. Negotiating the Indian traffic is not a part of standard driving lessons and can only be mastered by experience. The roads in Chennai are better maintained than the average Indian road. Rush hour traffic may result in nasty jams. Chennai has three arterial roads: Anna Salai/ Mount Road, EVR Periyar Salai/ Poonamallee High Road, Jawaharlal Nehru Salai/ 100 feet Road.
If you choose to rent a car, it's highly advisable to hire a driver as well, whose fee comes to around <a href="/en/Indian_rupee" title="Indian rupee"><img alt="Indian rupee" src="http://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/5/56/Indian_Rupee_symbol.png/7px-Indian_Rupee_symbol.png" width="7" height="10" style="vertical-align: baseline" /></a>150/- for an 8-hour shift.  Companies include:
Restaurants, watering holes and discotheques have been opening with increasing frequency and while the absolute numbers aren't much, they're more experimental than most Indian metros. While in Chennai one can drop into one of the following places.
Georgetown in the north of the city is considered the oldest neighbourhood and is associated with the nearby port. The whole area is an intense experience and a hive of commercial activity. Not too many tourists visit this part of the city, which is unfortunate because if Chennai's heart is to be found anywhere, it is here. This is where the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.deccanherald.com/content/306402/world-its-own.html">Sowcarpet</a> area is located and one of the cities most famous thoroughfares, Mint Street .

<i>Beach Watch Note</i> Although Chennai beaches are both beautiful and inviting, they <b>are not swimming beaches</b>, due to strong under currents present along the shoreline. <b>Swimming should not be attempted there.</b> There are no lifeguards and rescue equipment is not provided at any of these beaches. However there are "beach police" who ride on horses and keep an eye on the people and look out for any trouble. People should avoid wearing swimwear or similar attire in the city beaches as such clothing is not appropriate there and will attract stares.
Chennai has several well known beaches:
The coastline of Tamil Nadu stretches even further south, there are large number of hidden, untouched and uncommercialised beaches off the East Coast Road. A good 50kms south of the city, there are beaches virtually isolated perfect for few quiet hours of relaxation. Be cautious though, anti-social elements are always a risk.
<br />
Entry into the sanctum-sanctorum (the innermost part of the temple) of old temples maybe sometimes be restricted to foreigners because of the traditional beliefs that only a Hindu can enter the temples.

Chennai is a difficult place in which to drink. Government rules state that only establishments with a minimum of 21 bedrooms can obtain a bar/liquor license. Hence there are no standalone bars or pubs here. All the bars that are around are part of a hotel and are far apart. This makes traditional drinking activities like pub crawling an impossibility.
Drinking is a habit of two social classes in India: the lower sections of the society and the highest. As a result, you will either find dingy places or exceptionally classy ones.
Government run liquor stores called TASMAC are all over the place but, in general, not at all a pleasant experience. They usually have rude staff, are filthy and do not have the brand of your choice. Also, they tend to mark up each bottle by â¹5 to â¹10 over the listed price. Go for it if you want a one time war like experience in order to obtain some booze.
Clubs and discotheques must be a rarity in a conservative city like Chennai but there are plenty and the list is growing. Compared to other cities, Chennai has no curfews over closing hours, so theoretically they can be open till 24hours. But most clubs and bars close by 3am. Most bars couple as a night club

Chennai is generally a safer area of India in terms of crime, although pickpocketing, muggings, and robberies sporadically occur. Keep your doors and windows shut and locked at night and do not carry or display large amounts of cash if possible.
It is advisable for women, especially unaccompanied ones, to dress modestly and limit their interaction with unfamiliar local men. Foreigners are generally overcharged by autorickshaws simply because they are ignorant of the prevailing fares. It is necessary to confirm whether the driver knows the exact destination and to fix the fare before boarding. 'Autos', as autorickshaws are known in Chennai, are notorious for fleecing customers, tourists and locals alike.
Be alert to your surroundings and watch where you step, especially if you get caught in a large crowd where it is difficult to look at what is in front of you. Cross streets extremely carefully as traffic is generally heavy. On major roads, use the underground crossings (locally called "subways"). Avoid using underground road-crossing/ subways in the night or if you notice them to be empty. Traffic signals are frequently ignored by drivers and pedestrians alike, and it is not at all advisable for tourists to try driving in Chennai.
While in Chennai it is advisable to <b>drink only bottled water</b>. Do <b>not</b> trust water from small local restaurants as it may be from the tap, and avoid cold or iced drinks that are not commercially sold (Bigger chains of eatieries and juice shops can be trusted to an extent). Eating fresh vegetables and fruits that have sat outside in the presence of insects can also be unhealthy, although bananas and coconuts are usually safe because they are opened only immediately before eating. Hot drinks in restaurants such as tea, coffee, and other local specialties are safe, as are packaged/bottled drinks such as Aquafina water, Frooti (a popular local mango drink) and others. If you have access to a stove, boiling tap water before drinking is also an option. Never eat from roadside shops as the food is prepared in the most unhygienic conditions.
Chennai summers are humid and sultry; it's better to step out with an <b>umbrella</b>, <b>bottled water</b> and some <b>oral rehydration salts</b> (available from pharmacies, the brand name is Electral). These come in handy if you happen to get dehydrated.

It is best to change money at the city based money changers than the ones located at the airports. The ones at the airport offer much less for exchanging forex into Indian Rupees and sell forex for a much higher rate than the market rate.
Post Offices are a common sight, although they may be discreet without big advertisings. Ask the locals for the closest one. The Telegraph office on Anna Salai (Mount Rd), near Higginbothoms accepts letters and parcels up to 8PM with a small late fee. Snail Mail in India is by a Post Card (25Ps), Inland Letter Rs 5, or envelope Rs 5. The 'Speed Post' facility allows you to send mail more conveniently than a courier service.

Even as recently as about ten years ago, the ECR, which was then known as the New Mahabalipuram Road, had nothing much to offer by way of entertainment, except for VGP Golden Beach and Romulus Whittaker's crocodile bank. Further down, the road led you to Mahabalipuram, and that was that.
The scenario that meets a traveller today is entirely different. The East Coast Road could very well be termed the entertainment highway of Chennai. The road is brand new, flanked by the sea on the left and dotted with amusement spots through the entire stretch. Driving down ECR is an experience. Really!
You can pick and choose from Amusement Parks, Water Sports Centres, Beaches, Eco Conservation, Cultural and Religious Centres, Restaurants or Resorts to spend your day in. The road caters to practically every type of pastime that one could think about.
<b>Amusement Parks, Water Sports Centres, Beaches:</b>
<b>Prarthana Drive In Theatre:</b> Approximately 10 Kms out of Adyar, this complex offers both a drive in theatre and a drive in restaurant VGP. Probably one of the last few drive in theaters in the world.

<b>Ahaa Water Park:</b> A spot for frolicking in water, the Ahaa Water Park offers a variety of water sports and fun activities. It has a wave generator, which can generate waves of up to 3.5ft.
<b>Kart Attack:</b> A centre dedicated to fulfilling the speed maniac's desire for thrill in a safe and secure environment. The first go karting centre of Chennai, this has placed Chennai on the go karting map of India, and has been instrumental in creating a few go karting champions also.
<b>Radio Control Car Racing at ECR RC Track:</b> Chennai has the only active RC Car race track in India. On a weekend, you can find several RC car racers at the ECR RC Track located near Hot Kitchen Resatuarant on the ECR Road. It is very close to Kart Attack track. Visit IRCRA on Facebook for more details.
<b>Mayajaal:</b> 100,000 sq.ft of air-conditioned space. A multitude of activities and entertainment avenues, including movie theatres, bowling alleys, video games parlours, multicuisine food courts, and much more.

<b>MGM Dizzee World:</b> Spread over 27 acres, this theme park offers joy rides, food stalls and other games. It features one of the first roller coaster rides of Chennai, and many of the rides offered could make your hair stand on edge. On the softer side, you have the dashing car drives, and the swimming pool with its water slides.  MGM Dizzee World is in <a href="/en/Muttukadu" title="Muttukadu">Muttukadu</a> next to MGM Beach Resort.
<b>Little Folks &amp; Dolphin City:</b> Specifically aimed at providing entertainment for the children, this park has a longer history than MGM. Dolphin city was closed <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.petaindia.com/903dolphincity.html">[134]</a> after all of it's dolphins and sea lions had died. It is no longer operational now.
