<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://visitbrussels.be/"><b>Brussels</b></a> (French: <i>Bruxelles</i>, Dutch: <i>Brussel</i>) is the capital city of <a href="/en/Belgium" title="Belgium">Belgium</a> and of Brussels Capital Region. It is entirely surrounded by Dutch-speaking <a href="/en/Flanders" title="Flanders">Flanders</a> and its constituent <a href="/en/Flemish_Brabant" title="Flemish Brabant">Flemish Brabant</a> province. As headquarters of many European institutions, Brussels might also be considered something of a capital for the <a href="/en/European_Union" title="European Union" class="mw-redirect">European Union</a>. Being at the crossroads of cultures (the Germanic in the North and the Romance in the South) and playing an important role in <a href="/en/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a>, Brussels fits the definition of the archetypal "melting pot", but still retains its own unique character. The population of the city of Brussels is 1 million and the population of Brussels metropolitan area is just over 2 million.
When Brussels became the capital city of a new country in the 19th century, many buildings in the old town were destroyed to make way for brand new ministries, palaces, schools, army barracks and office blocks constructed between 1880 and 1980. The historic Flemish town centers are better preserved in other cities: <a href="/en/Antwerp" title="Antwerp">Antwerp</a>, <a href="/en/Bruges" title="Bruges">Bruges</a>, <a href="/en/Ghent" title="Ghent">Ghent</a>, <a href="/en/Courtray" title="Courtray">Courtray</a>, <a href="/en/Leuven" title="Leuven">Leuven</a> and <a href="/en/Mechelen" title="Mechelen">Mechelen</a>.
Brussels operates as a bilingual city where both French (80%) and Dutch (Flemish) (20%) are official languages. Thus all the streets have two names, which can sound totally different. For example, the Main Square is called both <i>la Grand Place</i> and <i>de Grote Markt</i>. Although officially bilingual, French is undoubtedly Brussels' <i>lingua franca</i>. English is also widely understood, but not always widely spoken. Visitors should realize that language is a very divisive issue in Belgium (though this is not as noticeable in Brussels).
Historically Dutch-speaking, Brussels became more and more French-speaking during the 19th and 20th centuries. Today, most inhabitants speak French in daily life. Some numbers say that more than half of the inhabitants of Brussels do not speak French or Dutch at home. The Brussels dialect, a Brabantian dialect of Dutch, can be heard, especially in the outer districts of Brussels Capital Region. French speakers shouldn't have too much trouble understanding the local French. Dutch speakers may have some difficulty with the Belgian Dutch accent.
English has become a common spoken language because of the international institutions based in Brussels, such as the European Commission, the European Parliament and NATO. It is still relatively rare to find written tourist or general information in English, although the situation is improving greatly. One can expect public announcements in train stations to at least be said in French and Dutch, while larger train stations (such as Zuidstation/Gare Du Midi) typically include English and sometimes German. English is also used on metros, trams and buses, announced last for information such as line transfers and terminal stops. Do not hesitate to ask someone if you do not understand what has been said.
Considering the city's location and that it markets itself as the capital of Europe, spoken English is less prevalent in Belgium than in its Dutch neighbor. However, even if it is not as widely spoken as one may expect, it is nonetheless widely understood. As is often the case elsewhere, success in finding someone who speaks English depends on several factors such as age (14-35 year-olds are most likely to speak English).
German is also an official language in Belgium spoken as a mother tongue by about 70,000 people in the east of the country bordering Germany, but you are very unlikely to encounter German speakers outside the German-speaking region in Belgium.
Brussels deservedly has a poor reputation for its weather. Weather in Brussels is very damp with a high and fairly evenly distributed annual average rainfall of 820 mm (32 in) and on average approximately 200 days of rainfall per year, both which are more than that of London and Paris. The dampness makes the weather feel much colder than it is. The daily and monthly temperature variations are quite small. Daily differences between average highs and average lows don't exceed 9ÂºC (48ÂºF).
In the summer, average daily maximum temperatures rarely exceed 22ÂºC (72ÂºF). The summer visitor should always be prepared for rain in Brussels. Warm and sunny weather is not constant during that season or even to be expected.
After October, temperatures drop off quite rapidly and winter months are damp and chilly. Snowfall is rare, and starts to melts fairly quickly, becoming slush on the ground. The winter visitor should be prepared for wet ground.
Brussels is split into nineteen <i>communes</i> or <i>gemeenten</i> (municipalities/boroughs):
Brussels' main airport is <b>Brussels Airport</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.brusselsairport.be">[4]</a>, (locally still commonly referred to as <b>Brussels National</b> or <b>Zaventem</b>) (IATA code: <b>BRU</b>). Several major carriers operate out of the airport, including the local <b>Brussels Airlines</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.brusselsairlines.com">[5]</a>.
Brussels Airport has a <b>luggage locker service</b> (Level 0) where you can leave luggage for a fixed duration. The lockers say that you will have to retrieve your bags within 72 hours or else they will be removed, but they are actually moved to the room next door and stored until you retrieve them. This is a useful facility for people wanting to stow away big suitcases somewhere safe. The rate is â¬7.50 per day. You need to pay in coins, a change machine is nearby.
A <b>train</b> (â¬7.80) runs every 15 min from the airport (Level -1) to Brussels' three main stations taking 15-25 minutes, with most trains continuing to other parts of Belgium.
STIB-<b>bus</b> 12 and 21 (12 before 8pm and is an express, serving only major bus stops; 21 after 8pm and on weekends, serving all stops on the route) run every 20-30 minutes via metro station <i>Schuman</i> (where you can transfer to metro lines 1 and 5) to the European district around <i>Place du Luxembourg</i>/<i>Luxemburgplein</i>. The same ticket is valid for a total of 60 minutes on the trains (by SNCB), metro (by STIB), buses (by STIB, De Lijn and TEC) or trams (by STIB) into the centre from the moment it is validated as you get on the bus. The buses depart from level 0. The ticket price is â¬4.00 from the vending machine next to the bus stop, or â¬6.00 on board <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.mivb.be/airport-line.html?l=en">[6]</a>.You can buy "Discover Brussels" card <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.stib.be/DiscoverBrussels.html?l=en">[7]</a>for 24 hours, which costs â¬6.50, and includes your trip from the airport. This way you just give â¬2.50 to use Brussels Public transport for 24 hours. "Discover Brussels" card can be bought at the same "GO" ticket vending machine on the bus stop of 12/21. Frequent travelers can buy a 10-trip ticket (â¬25.00), a monthly ticket (â¬49.00) or a yearly ticket (â¬514.00) for this line. The latter is valid on the entire STIB network.
De Lijn-<b>bus</b> 272 and 471 run every 30-60 minutes to Brussels' North Station (called <i>Noordstation</i>/<i>Gare du Nord</i> within the city or <i>Brussel-Noord</i>/<i>Bruxelles-Nord</i> in other places), just north of the city's historic core. The buses also depart from level 0. The ticket price is â¬ 3.00 on board. In contrast to the tickets sold by STIB, these tickets (sold by De Lijn) are not valid on other means of public transport within Brussels.
A <b>taxi</b> to the center costs around â¬35. Taxis bleus/blauw (blue): +32 2 268 0000, Taxis Autolux: +32 2 411 4142, Taxis verts/groen (green): +32 2 349 4949. Beware of "waiting" charges if your flight is delayed and you pre-ordered a cab, some companies charge you parking fees + â¬25-30/h for waiting. Always confirm the final charge with your driver before getting in the car. It is not uncommon for drivers to rip you off and ask 80â¬ even more to go to the center, especially if they realize that it is your first time in Brussels and don't know your way around.
Several budget airlines, including <b>Ryanair</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.ryanair.com">[8]</a> and <b>Wizzair</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.wizzair.com">[9]</a> fly to <b>Brussels South Charleroi Airport</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://charleroi-airport.com/">[10]</a> (IATA code <b>CRL</b>), connecting to cities such as Barcelona, Belgrade, Budapest, Dublin, Edinburgh, Manchester, Rome and Warsaw. This airport is south of Brussels and one hour drive away from Brussels Midi/Zuid Station at the city center.
A <b>shuttle bus</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.voyages-lelan.be">[11]</a> (â¬14 one way, â¬22 return) runs every 30 minutess to Brussels Midi/Zuid station. Unless you want to spend a good 40 min in the queue to purchase a ticket, it would be advisable to purchase your ticket online before you arrive. You will be asked to pick specific times, but they are flexible with allowing you to change the time if your flight arrives earlier or later. To purchase your ticket after arrival, the kiosk is outside the airport and to the right. There is a big arrow on the ground that directs you to the kiosk. The buses wait in the same area, but are poorly labelled so check with the driver before loading your bags.
The bus stops at Midi/Zuid station, on the Rue de France/Frankrijkstraat in the west. The metro and international trains (Eurostar, Thalys) are on the west side of the station, so upon entering the station from the bus stop, head left rather than straight. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.b-rail.be/nat/E/assets/downloads/brux_midi_angl.pdf">Midi/Zuid station PDF map</a>
To go by <b>train</b>, take <i>TEC-bus A</i> (â¬5.00 one way) direct from the airport to the Charleroi South (<i>Charleroi-Sud</i>) train station. A combined train+bus ticket to or from Brussels can be obtained for â¬ 14.20 from the TEC vending machine at the airport. Intercity trains (â¬ 9.20 one way) to Brussels depart every 30-60 minutes, continuing to either <a href="/en/Antwerp" title="Antwerp">Antwerp</a> (<i>Anvers</i>) or Essen. These trains call at Brussels South (<i>Bruxelles-Midi</i>/<i>Brussel-Zuid</i>), Brussels Central (<i>Bruxelles-Central</i>/<i>Brussel-Centraal</i>) and Brussels North (<i>Bruxelles-Nord</i>/<i>Brussel-Noord</i>).
You can also get a <b>taxi</b> from the airport to the city center, but this will cost a fixed price of â¬90. For the return trip to Charleroi you can book in advance a Charleroi-based taxi (â¬90). Taxis operating from Brussels use a higher fare and will take you to the airport for a fixed price of â¬120 or based on the meter up to â¬170.
<b>Antwerp Airport</b> (IATA code <b>ANR</b>) <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.antwerp-airport.be">[12]</a> also has a good train connection to Brussels.
Brussels has three main train stations: <b>Midi-Zuid</b>, to the south of the city core, <b>Central-Centraal</b>, which is right next to the city center, and <b>Nord-Noord</b>, to the north of the city center (at <i>Place Rogier</i>). High-speed trains stop only at <i>Midi/Zuid</i>, except the ICE also stops at <i>Nord/Noord</i>. There is a shower at <i>Midi/Zuid</i> located in the toilet near platforms 19-20 (between Origin'O and Quick).
Most sights in Brussels are fairly close together, within reasonable walking distance of each other. The oldest part of town can have uneven cobblestone roads, but the rest of the city is fairly easy to walk. Many roads in the old town are closed to cars. Brussels has many wet days, and in winter small amounts of snow can make the ground slushy, so water-resistant footwear is a must if you will be out walking all day.
The metro in Brussels is quite clean and safe compared to most metro systems. Metro entrances are marked by big "M" signs in blue and white, with the station name underneath. All announcements are made in Dutch, French and English.
Brussels revamped its metro at the start of April 2009 to boast six lines, and at the same time rescheduled several tram and bus routes. Single tickets, called <i>Jump 1</i> cost â¬2.00 if pre-purchased and are available from the driver for â¬2.50 (only trams and buses, not metro).
You validate the ticket in the small orange machines located in buses/trams, or at the entrance to metro stations/major tram stops. The orange machines time-stamp the ticket, both in ink and magnetically, and it will be valid for one hour. You can interrupt your ride and interchangeably use any STIB/MIVB transport. You should revalidate your ticket for each new ride.
One, five and ten ride tickets (called <i>Jump 1</i>, <i>Jump 5</i> and <i>Jump 10</i> respectively) are available at all metro and bigger train stations. They can also be bought from vending machines near major bus and tram stops. A card that can be used for ten rides on public transport costs â¬13.50. There is also a <b>1 day pass</b> (called <i>Jump 1 jour/1 dag</i>) available for â¬6.50. These tickets can be purchased either at staffed windows or from kiosks. However, the kiosks do not accept many credit and debit cards and will only accept cash payments in coins.
Be aware that the 10 ride ticket can be used by more than one person. Example, if two of you are traveling together, you can just buy one 10 ride ticket, and when you enter the bus, or metro or tram, you validate the ticket twice by entering the ticket on the small orange machine two times. As soon as the ticket is spit out, you enter it again, and the machine will say 2 person, and there will be two lines on the ticket to indicate this. if you know you're going to use public transport a lot, getting the 10 fare pass might be cheaper than getting individual tickets.
Tickets that bear the name <b>Jump</b> are also valid on all <i>SNCB</i>/<i>NMBS</i>-trains and on buses run by Flemish public bus company <i>De Lijn</i> and Walloon public bus company <i>TEC</i> within the Brussels Capital Region.
Since 2009, the city offers low-cost short-term "Villo" rentals at 180 locations near the central city. The system only accepts Smart cards (the ones with an electronic chip and activated by a PIN code), it does not accept the regular magnetic stripe cards. The first half hour is free, the next costs â¬0.50. Registration costs â¬1.50 for a day and â¬7 for a week. The year long ticket costs â¬30. It is advisable to wear a helmet and a fluo vest (not mandatory). The bikes are robust, but rather heavy. More detailed information can be found online at Villo (English, French and Dutch).<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://en.villo.be/abonnez_vous/les_tarifs/consultez_les_tarifs">[25]</a>.

Brussels is considered to be the de facto capital of the European Union, having a long history of hosting the institutions of the European Union within its European Quarter. The EU has no official capital, and no plans to declare one, but Brussels hosts the official seats of the European Commission, Council of the European Union, European Council, as well as a second seat of the European Parliament.
<b>WoluwÃ©-Saint-Pierre</b> is a commune in Brussels. It is mostly a well-to-do residential area, which includes the wide, park-lined, Tervuren Avenue (French: Avenue de Tervueren, Dutch: Tervurenlaan) and the numerous embassies located near the Montgomery Square (Square Montgomery, Montgomeryplein).
You can see what's going on in Brussels by picking up a copy of local free city newspaper <i>Zone 02</i>. Another good free listings paper is <i>Agenda</i>, which is distributed together with the Dutch-language weekly <i>Brussel Deze Week</i> and has the notable advantage of being published in three languages (English, Dutch, French). Both of these are distributed in cafÃ©s and bars around the city. If you're looking for a good party, online listing Net Events (French and Dutch) and Ready2Move, are a good place to start.
Brussels Agenda is the official cultural and entertainment agenda of the City of Brussels and the francophone MÃ©diatheque has a website featuring the upcoming concerts in Brussels and the rest of Belgium. However, their listings page only features concerts MÃ©diatheque staff are interested in.
The most widely read English magazine is <i>The Bulletin</i> which, apart from covering Belgian and EU news, also offers arts and lifestyle stories, as well as in-depth events listings and a TV guide.
Brussels has a fair number of cinemas, if limited compared to most European capitals. French films are subtitled in Dutch, and vice versa, all other films are shown in the original version subtitled in French and Dutch (on cinema listings look for 'OV').
Brussels has a good selection of year round events, many suitable for English speaking visitors. The following sites are are useful to check out what's on.
The <b>Paleis voor Schone Kunsten</b> (Dutch) or <b>Palais des Beaux-Arts</b> (French) <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.bozar.be/">[77]</a>, Rue Ravensteinstraat 23, tel: 02 507 82 0, is often referred to as "Bozar" or "PSK". Construction was completed in 1928 and includes exhibition and conference rooms, movie theater and concert hall which serves as home to the National Orchestra of Belgium. The complex contains a large concert hall, a recital room, a chamber music room, lecture rooms and a vast gallery for temporary exhibitions. Since 2002, the Belgian federal institution has chosen the brand name BOZAR. It has seven artistic departments: Bozar Expo, Bozar Music, Bozar Cinema, Bozar Dance, Bozar Theatre, Bozar Literature, Bozar Studios and Bozar Architecture.
Very few shops in Brussels open before 10AM, and most kick off about 10:30-11AM. Many shops are closed on Sunday and Monday.
<br />
<br />
<b>Chocolate until you drop</b><br />
Brussels is chock full of chocolates, but the ultimate indulgence for the chocoholic is Place du Grand Sablon-Grote Zavel Plein, where you will find three shops selling some of the best chocolate in the world: <b>Neuhaus</b>, <b>Pierre Marcolini</b> and <b>Wittamer</b>. Each store has its own specialties: Pierre Marcolini's take-away cakes and ice cream are reasons to be tempted, while Wittamer is the only one with a cafe on premises and also sells the ultimate hot chocolate. <b>Passion Chocolat</b> (20 Rue Vanderlindenstraat) is a bit out of the way but its artisan chocolate is worth a visit, and you can taste lots of it for free at the entrance.
There is plenty of good eating to be had in Brussels. Most people concentrate on the three classics: <b>mussels</b> (<i>moules</i> in French and <i>mosselen</i> in Flemish), <b>fries</b> (<i>frites</i> in French and <i>frieten</i> in Flemish) and <b>chocolate</b>. A few more adventurous <i>Bruxellois/Brusselse</i> dishes include <i>anguilles au vert/paling in 't groen</i> (river eels in green sauce), meat balls in tomato sauce, <i>stoemp</i> (mashed vegetables and potatoes) and <i>turbot waterzooi</i> (turbot fish in cream and egg sauce). For dessert, try a Belgian <b>waffle</b> (<i>wafel</i> in Flemish and <i>gauffre</i> in French), also available in a square Brussels version dusted with powdered sugar, and choices of bananas, whipped cream and many other toppings. Although many prefer the round, caramelized version from <a href="/en/Li%C3%A8ge" title="LiÃ¨ge">LiÃ¨ge</a>.
One shall however always bear in mind that it is important to check the prices of food items before ordering, just like what people should do when visiting pubs in France and Soho, London. Beware especially when servers make choices for you. It has been reported that tourists have to pay up to â¬7 for a litre of sparkling water, costing less than â¬0.70 in local stores. Leave the restaurant without paying in such a case, as violence is often resulted where confrontations arise.
Visitors should also beware of the 'Italian Restaurant Streets' in the tourist and shopping districts. These streets are lined with small Italian restaurants, some offering "3 course meals" for just â¬12 or 13. They are all run by just a few shop owners and serve unappetizing store purchased food. They will not 'include service' as most all restaurants in Brussels do, and many tourists have reported getting <i>scammed</i> here, especially when not paying with exact change. A common practice is to present you a menu where prices aren't anything near the ones advertised in the windows. Be sure you ask why there is such a price difference BEFORE ordering and do not hesitate to leave if you do not agree with the price. If you were offered a drink and already sipped from your glass before receiving the menu (as is often the case) then just pay for the drink and leave.
The matter over which establishment serves up the best frites (locally known as <i>fritkots</i> in Flemish and "friterie" in French) remains a matter of heated debate. Some argue that the best frites in Brussels are served at the fritkot near the Barriere de Saint-Gilles, while others defend St-Josse's Martin (Place Saint-Josse/Sint-Joostplein) as the prime purveyor of the authentic Brussels frite just as others claim Antoine (Place Jourdan/Jourdanplein) remains the king of the local french fry. No matter which fritkot you're at, try to be adventurous and have something other than ketchup or mayonnaise on your fries. Of the selection of bizarre sauces you've never seen before, "andalouse" is probably the most popular with the locals.
<b>FRITKOTS</b>
<b>Cheap Dining</b>
Brussels' tourist restaurant gauntlet can be found in Rue des Bouchers-Beenhouwerstraat, just to the north of Grand Place. The place has a bad reputation for waiters imposing themselves on passers-by, trying to lure customers into their restaurant. The authorities are aware of this, and are trying to take measures. Some restaurants may also tempt you with cheap prices for the menus, but when seated, the item on the menu happens to be unavailable, and you're forced to accept another, noticeably more expensive dish. Often, the exaggerated price of the wines will also compensate for the attractive menu. Knowing this however, you may be able to negotiate a better deal before entering.
A few restaurants stand out from the crowd though:
Close to the Bourse Jules Van Praetstraat (rue Jules Van Praet) is another rapidly developing street of restaurants and bars. Those of note include:
Place Saint Catherine-Catherinplaats is also a popular area, and once the fishmongering center of Brussels. While many of the fish shops have moved elsewhere, it is still home to many good seafood restaurants featuring lobster as a specialty.
It is outside the touristic center that the best deals can be found. Here are a few addresses in the Upper Town and Louise Area:
In Ixelles-Elsene:
Forget about eating out if you're strictly vegan(maybe at EXKI). There are some vegetarian restaurants that might cater without animal products though. Some small snack joints do make up vegetarian sandwiches on request.
Belgium is to beer what France is to wine, it is home to one of the greatest beer traditions in the world, and Brussels is a great place to sample some of the vast variety on offer. Typical beers of Brussels are <i>gueuze</i> (rather sour) and <i>kriek</i> (rather sweet, cherry based).
Smoking is prohibited in all bars.
A special drink only found in Brussels is the "half-en-half" ("half and half"). It's a mixture of white wine and champagne.
Hotel rates in Brussels can vary widely (especially at the upper end) depending on how many EU bigwigs happen to be in town. Good deals are often available on weekends and during the summer when the bureaucrats flee on vacation.

<br />
Brussels is generally a safe city. Some suburban neighborhoods have a poor reputation, but most travellers are unlikely to visit them. The neighborhoods of Schaarbeek, Brussels North, St-Josse, Marollen, Anneessens, Molenbeek and Anderlecht are often explained as neighborhoods that should be avoided at night if possible, most often by inhabitants that do not live there.
Even the good neighborhoods., like those close to the Schuman area/metro, may have pickpockets wondering around, specially in warmer days when people love to sit outside to eat or have a coffee. If you decide to eat outside, never ever put your personal bags on the floor, or next to you. Make sure that they are attached to you, or they are safely guarded. Thieves might stop by your table to ask for change, and while one distracts the group, another one is swiping goods. Also, if you just put your purse/bag on the table, a pickpocket will simply walk by, grab it, and run. Again, personal belongings should be well guarded, and not put in a position where they can be easily snatched.
Also, pickpockets, sometimes in teams, operate in crowded tourist areas, and the train and metro stations (particularly at night) as well as parks (even in daytime) attract drug addicts and other shady types. Travellers should be particularly alert for distractions such as being asked for the time or directions and having attention diverted from their hand or shopping bag. Particulary popular at the moment seems to be the "soccer move distraction", when they suddenly stick their foot between your legs as if they are playing an imaginary soccer game. And Asians, avoid if anyone approaches with the words "Bollywood", "Shahrukh Khan" , "Amitabh Bhachchan" - they are for your wallets than your looks!
Avoid travelling with laptops at any time and also, if you have a fancy smartphone, avoid taking it out in buses, metro or tram. Somebody will snatch from your hands faster than you can say help. Or it will be taken from your pocket without you realizing it.
In the <i>Parc de Bruxelles/Warandepark</i>, between the Royal Palace and the Belgian Parliament, criminals have been noted threatening their victims with violence. Do not leave your bags unwatched but keep them close to your body. If you are robbed, there is a police office right next to the gate in front of the Belgian Parliament (on the right side when leaving the park, hidden in the bushes) where experienced policemen will help you. Most of them speak French, Dutch and English well. But be warned, many times police can't do much about finding your goods, but maybe they will give you a report so you can file with your insurance company, if you have insurance. Also, many times, police will tell you that they are closing or that the person in charge of taking the report is not available. Unfortunately, Belgian police is not known for being the most helpful when it comes to recovering stolen goods.
In addition to the above advice be aware of Brussels Midi-Zuid train station, one of the poorest areas in the city: it is not advised to wander there alone at night, and if you're a female traveling alone. There are very few women in this area, some people find this scary.
In train stations, especially the Nord-Noord train station, scam artists show up in groups trying to distract you with some questions and steal your belongings. They are really professional, and business travelers are often targeted, although anybody is game, specially if they have electronic valuables (smartphones), that can be easily snatched.
Also, outside the central station, there are men with red vests asking for donations, or signatures, or trying to sell you some community paper. Ignore them if they approach you, or walk away from them. These individuals are very persistent and they will try to show you a badge to show that they are "legit", but if you stop to sign papers or give them a donation, another one will empty out your pockets. This type of scam is very common in many European cities.
Finally, you will see women in stations like Porte de Namur-Naamsepoort, or Place De BrouckÃ¨re-BrouckÃ¨replein, holding babies and asking for money. Do not give money to these beggars as they are managed by "begging gangs." If you come early enough to these stations, you will see them being dropped off by their handlers in fancy cars. Save your money for legit charities in your own countries.
