<b>Madrid</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.esmadrid.com">[1]</a> is the capital and largest city of <a href="/en/Spain" title="Spain">Spain</a>, as well as the capital of the autonomous community of the same name (<a href="/en/Comunidad_de_Madrid" title="Comunidad de Madrid" class="mw-redirect">Comunidad de Madrid</a>). The population of the city is roughly 3.3 million with a metro area population of almost 6.5 million. Madrid is best known for its great cultural and artistic heritage, a good example of which is the El Prado museum. Madrid also boasts some of the liveliest nightlife in the world.
Madrid is located just northeast of the geographical center of the <a href="/en/Iberia" title="Iberia">Iberian Peninsula</a>, in the middle of the Spanish central Castillian plateau (Meseta central), at an average altitude of 650m. Nearly all of the most famous tourist areas are located in the center of the city including Puerta del Sol, Plaza Mayor, Palacio Real, and Plaza de ColÃ³n. The major streets in Madrid include the Gran Via, AlcalÃ¡ Street, and Paseo de la Castellana.
The climate of Madrid is continental; mainly dry and quite extreme at times. Madrid sees perpetual sunshine and a characteristically hot and dry summer, and a fairly cold winter with frequent frosts during the night and the occasional snowfall. Spring and autumn are mild with the most rainfall concentrated in these seasons. Spring and autumn are definitely the best times to visit, especially the months of April, May, June, September and October. There is very little rainfall during summer and also less rainfall during winter. During winter snow occurs sporadically; however, snowfall usually lasts only for a few days, but there is abundant snowfall in the adjacent mountain ranges nearby.
The culture of Madrid was dominated by its Royal history, centre of the Spanish Empire. The Royal Palace, big places and buildings used by the Spanish Monarchy, enormous cathedrals and churches are plentiful in Madrid, as well as medieval architecture, although nowadays Madrid is just as much a cosmopolitan city as <a href="/en/Berlin" title="Berlin">Berlin</a> or <a href="/en/London" title="London">London</a>, full of new architecture, lifestyle and culture.
As Spanish Capital, Madrid has meant the different "establishment" for most Spaniards. During the 2nd Republic (1931-1936) was a bustling city of new ideas. Being capital of the Franquist dictatorship (1939-1975) made the city still seemed to represent a conservative part of Spain to many Spaniards. However, the city is also the epicentre of the famous Movida, Spain's 80s movement that bred personalities such as the director Pedro AlmodÃ³var. The heritage of this era is indeed still visible in the city centre, where a party can be found at all times and one of the most liberal and colourful environments of Spain can be seen. The city is also known for its great gay tolerance.
The citizens of Madrid, who refer to themselves as <b>MadrileÃ±os</b> or the more traditional and currently seldom used term "gatos" (cats), live by a daily routine that is heavily influenced by the climate. Due to the typically midday heat during summer, a "siesta" can be still observed during which some citizens take a break to cool off, though <b>MadrileÃ±os</b> can usually only afford this 'luxury' during holidays and weekends. Most stores are open during all the day; just small stores are often closed during this time. Workers and those more afflicted by Western lifestyles choose not to observe this long break and work traditional business hours, which are usually between 9AM and 6-7PM. During summer many offices, however, will have a summer schedule requiring workers to start at 8am and finish at 3pm (most commonly without the standard 1-2 hour break for lunch). Offices usually close during the weekend but businesses are often open Saturday morning (downtown stays open until afternoon). Most grocers are closed on Sundays, but some major chain and department stores linked to "culture" (books, music, etc.) will be open throughout the day and all of them on the first Sunday of the month. Shops and department stores in Puerta del Sol area are open every day.
Madrid possibly has the largest number of bars per capita of any European city and a very active nightlife; MadrileÃ±os are known to stay up until as late as 5AM-7AM. It is quite common to see a crowded Gran VÃ­a on weekend nights. It is important to note that, due to this lifestyle, lodging located near the fun areas may end up a nightmare for light sleepers if your window faces the street.
Madrid has a very modernized and elaborate transportation network of buses and Metro. The city contrasts with some large European cities in that it is extremely clean, and city employees in bright yellow vests can almost always be seen cleaning the streets and sidewalks. Like most large cities, however, there is a substantial population of vagrants and beggars lining the streets.
Madrid is one of the biggest and most cosmopolitan cities in Europe. Communities of West Africans, North Africans, other Europeans, Chinese, Indians, Filipinos, Pakistanis and (especially) Latin Americans are prominent.
Some popular neighborhoods are:
<b>Madrid Barajas International Airport</b> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IATA" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:IATA">IATA</a>: <b>MAD</b>), +34 902 404 704, <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.aena.es/csee/Satellite?pagename=subHome&amp;Language=EN_GB&amp;c=Page&amp;SiteName=MAD&amp;cid=1049727006353">[2]</a> is located 13km from the city center. It is one of the largest airports in Europe and is serviced by many airlines, as well as being the homebase for Iberia Airlines. The airport has 4 terminals. Terminals 1, 2 and 3 are close together and serviced by the same metro station, while Terminal 4 is far from those and has its own metro and commuter train stations.
By far the most convenient way of reaching downtown is a <b>24-hours express bus service</b><a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.emtmadrid.es/lineaAeropuerto/index.html">[3]</a> that passes all terminals and then goes direct to <i>O'Donell</i>, <i>Cibeles</i> (20 minutes walk or quick metro ride to <i>Puerta del Sol</i>)  and <i>Atocha</i> (<b>main train station</b>, not serviced between 11:30 PM and 6 AM). 5 euros. Departures every 12(day)-35(late night) minutes. Travel time Terminal 4 (end of line) - Cibeles 30-40 minutes.
The airport is also connected to the city by <i>Cercanias</i> <b>commuter train</b> (line C-1, from 05:30 to 23:30,  â¬2.15) and <b>Metro</b> (line 8 pink, from 06:30 to 01:30, to/from the airport â¬5.00). From Terminal 4 take the commuter train (look for <i>Renfe Cercanias</i>) to "Nuevos Ministerios" and then transfer to line C-3 or C-4 southbound on platform 8; <i>Sol</i> will be the first stop. Alternatively, you can also take the Metro to Nuevos Ministerios station from either airport terminal, but in order to reach the city centre (Sol, Ãpera or Gran VÃ­a), you must change metro line twice - first in Nuevos Ministerios (which is a huge station and involves a lot of walking) and then again at another station, which is obviously quite inconvenient.
Public bus 200 operates between the airport and Avenida de AmÃ©rica bus station in Madrid. It is only 2.00â¬ and you can use your weekly ticket or 10-trips ticket.
Public night bus N4 goes from Plaza Cibeles to Barajas district, 400m walk from the terminal through a passageway over the highway.  Best to get off at the second-last stop, Avenida Central, and then make a right turn immediately after the bus stop. Go straight on, keep going straight crossing the parking lot, and then you make a left to cross another huge parking lot. After that you see the road and the pedestrian highway overpass. Only 1.50 Euros or the 10-trip ticket is valid as well.
<b>Night Shuttle</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.madshuttle.com/night.html">[4]</a> operates a night bus between the airport and city centre for â¬9.90 per person.
<b>Taxis</b> from the airport to the city centre cost ~â¬32.
<b>Renfe</b>, <i>+34</i> 902-240-202, <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.renfe.com/EN/viajeros/index.html">[5]</a> operates train service to/from Madrid. Frequent trains operate between Madrid and <a href="/en/Barcelona" title="Barcelona">Barcelona</a> (2h 40min), <a href="/en/Seville" title="Seville">Seville</a> (2h 20 min), <a href="/en/Malaga" title="Malaga">Malaga</a> (2h 30 min), <a href="/en/Zaragoza" title="Zaragoza">Zaragoza</a>, <a href="/en/Tarragona" title="Tarragona">Tarragona</a>, <a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Lerida&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Lerida (page does not exist)">Lerida</a>, <a href="/en/Huesca" title="Huesca">Huesca</a>, <a href="/en/Ciudad_Real" title="Ciudad Real">Ciudad Real</a>, <a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Puertollano&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Puertollano (page does not exist)">Puertollano</a>, <a href="/en/Lisbon" title="Lisbon">Lisbon</a>, <a href="/en/Milan" title="Milan">Milan</a>, the French coast, <a href="/en/Paris" title="Paris">Paris</a>, with continuing journeys to most of <a href="/en/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a>.
Madrid has two train stations: ChamartÃ­n and Atocha, both of which have excellent Metro and Cercanias commuter train connections. Most northbound and international trains arrive and depart from ChamartÃ­n station, while trains to <a href="/en/Barcelona" title="Barcelona">Barcelona</a>, <a href="/en/Valencia_(City)" title="Valencia (City)" class="mw-redirect">Valencia</a> and southern <a href="/en/Spain" title="Spain">Spain</a> depart from Atocha. If you need to get between the two stations, Metro line 1 (â¬1.50, 30-40 minutes) or Cercanias lines C3 and C4 (â¬1.35, 15 minutes) offer the most direct connection.
<b>ChamartÃ­n</b> station is on the north side of the city and is served by the Metro stop of the same name on Metro lines 1 and 10. <b>Atocha</b> is on the southern side of the city center and is divided into two main sections, an area for Cercanias trains and one for long-distance trains. The long-distance side is set inside the towering old station, where you will find a tropical garden with a pond full of small turtles as well as a number of shops. A memorial to the victims of the terrorist attack of March 11, 2004 is in the Cercanias portion of the station near the Metro stop.
Madrid has eight enormous international and intercity bus stations. Information on where buses to a particular destination depart from can be found at the Tourist Office.
Many of the international buses, and those headed south of Madrid, arrive at and depart from <b>EstaciÃ³n Sur de Autobuses</b> (<i>Calle de MÃ©ndez Ãlvaro</i>, Tel:+34 91-468-4200 <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.estacionautobusesmadrid.com">[6]</a>) which is accessible by metro.
Buses to and from <a href="/en/Barcelona" title="Barcelona">Barcelona</a> and <a href="/en/Bilbao" title="Bilbao">Bilbao</a> operate from the <b>Avenida de AmÃ©rica bus terminal</b>, also accessible by Metro.
There are car rental facilities available at the airport, train stations, and other main travel sites. Always be sure to have a street map handy!  The roads within Madrid are difficult to navigate as there are no places to stop and consult a map or check your route.
Also, if you are relying on GPS navigation, be aware that there are several consecutive junctions underground near the centre and your GPS may not get a signal underground.  Plan your turns before you enter the tunnels.
Madrid city is well covered by the main global car rental companies, such as Avis, Budget,Hertz, Thrifty &amp; Europcar, some of these also provide Rent to Buy Facilities. All car rental companies offer competitive pricing for economy class vehicles and unlimited mileage options. Some local car rental companies may also offer competitive pricing.
For FREE parking but within walking distance of 20 mins to city centre (Sol), try the street at Principe Pio metro stop. The place to park is the street near to the shopping mall called Calle de Mozart. It is packed with cars on weekday mornings because of people getting to the Metro station. During the evenings and weekends it's easy to get a parking spot.
Madrid proudly sports one of the best public transportation networks in the world and the second largest metro network in Europe, second only to London's. Buses and subways form an integrated network <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://ctm-madrid.es/">[7]</a> and work with the same tickets. <br /> A single ticket costs â¬1.50 (5 stations) â â¬2.00, a ten trip ticket costs â¬12.20 / â¬18.30. <br /> Alternatively, you can buy unlimited travel passes as follows: 1 day (â¬8), 2 days (â¬13.40), 3 days (â¬17.40), 5 days (â¬25.50), or 7 days (â¬33.40). <br /> Children under the age of 4 may travel without a ticket. Children under 11 receive a 50% discount. Tickets can be purchased at Metro stations, news-stands, and <i>estancos</i> (tobacconists').
The <b>Metro de Madrid</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.metromadrid.es/">[8]</a> (Madrid's Subway/Underground) is one of the best and less expensive metros in Europe. In addition, the underground tunnels of the Metro provide relief from the sun on hot days. Ticket machines are multilingual with instructions in Spanish, English, French, and German. Stamping the ticket one time allows you to use the Metro network as long and far as you like - make sure you stay inside the Metro zone, once you leave it, you'll have to stamp your ticket again. When you travel to or from airport stations, there is additional supplement of â¬3, which can be paid at the entrance or exit. The Passes do not require this supplement-it is included in the price. You can catch some trains as late as 2:00AM, although the official close time for the metro system is at 1:30AM.
Nights before Saturdays, Sundays, and public holidays have a night bus (MetroBÃºho) service on the same routes as the Metro lines, from rougly 01:00AM to 05:30AM. Stops for these lines are sometimes not in obvious places, especially in the pedestrian areas in the city center.
Announcements in the metro are made only in Spanish, though signs are bilingual in Spanish and English.
Whatever the Metro doesn't cover, the buses do.
Night buses (<i>BÃºhos</i>, "night owls"), have their main hub at <i>Plaza de Cibeles</i> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.ctm-madrid.es/">[9]</a>, covering most of the city at roughly 20-minute intervals.
Buses are equipped with free wi-fi facility (EMTmadrid), easy to use with any type of laptop or netbook.
Madrid has a system of local trains (<i>CercanÃ­as</i>) that connect outlying suburbs and villages with the city center. Although most useful for visiting historic or outdoor destinations outside the city core, they are also useful for quickly getting from the north end of the city (Chamartin and Nuevos Ministros) to the south end of the city (Sol and Atocha) and, as of Sept 2011, Barajas airport (terminal 4).
Taxis can be hard to find during late hours on weekends, especially if there is some rain. Unlike in other European cities, there are few taxi stands; just stand by the side of a major road or bus stop and wave your hand to signal an available taxi passing by. Available taxis have a green <i>libre</i> sign in the windshield and a green light on top.
Official taxis are white, and have a red stripe and the flag of Madrid on the front door. The tariff is displayed on top of the car (a <i>1</i> during daytime, a <i>2</i> during the night, which become 2 and 3 on holidays such as Christmas Eve).
There are also special surcharges for entering or leaving the airport/train station. Ask for the written table of tariffs and charges (<i>suplementos</i>) (shown on small stickers on rear windows, compulsory by law) before paying if you think it's too expensive.
Be aware there are some taxi drivers that will do what is called 'la vuelta al ruedo' which basically means they will drive you around or through the crowded avenues to increase the fare.
Most taxi drivers do not speak English, so you should have the names and/or addresses of your destinations written in Spanish to show your taxi driver. Likewise, get your hotel's business card in case you get lost.
Transportation by private automobile in Madrid can be a nightmare. The Spanish capital suffers from the typical problems of most big cities; far too many cars and not enough space to accommodate them. Sometimes there can even be traffic jams in the <i>Paseo de la Castellana</i> at 3:00 AM (early to some MadrileÃ±os). The problem is compounded by the narrow streets in the old town, where a lorry delivering beer barrels to a local bar can cause a huge tailback. Finding a parking space can be very time consuming, and difficult if one is not skilled in the art of close proximity parallel parking. Many Spaniards are also lacking in this art, prompting them to simply park in the street, blocking other cars in. If you find yourself blocked in by such a practice, honk your horn until the driver returns. If you parallel park your car in Madrid, be aware that most MadrileÃ±os park by sound alone. They will feel no remorse for repeatedly hitting the car in front and behind them while trying to get into or out of a tight spot. If you value your car's paint job, or you have rented a car, it may be best to park underground. Though this is no guarantee for nobody hitting your car, the chances are somewhat diminished.
In short, renting a car is not only unnecessary, but not recommended for getting around downtown Madrid, and a car is likely to be more of a liability than an asset. Visitors should make use of Madrid's excellent public transportation instead. Renting a car only makes sense if you are planning to leave Madrid and drive to the nearby towns.
Although Madrid does not appear as a bike-friendly city at a first sight, things are changing slowly to make bike experience more comfortable. Several streets in historical downtown have been transformed into mixed-traffic spaces where pedestrians and bikes have priority over cars. There are new easy-bike paths all along the river and connecting important parks.
It is also possible to use a lot of narrow easy streets where traffic is slow and calm to travel along the city without depending on exclusive bike paths. There are some official and unofficial publications with these streets along the web. <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.infobicimadrid.es/gis_bicis.htm">[10]</a>
To avoid some of Madrid inconveniencies, such as hot weather or slopy streets it is also possible to get bikes  on Metro and Railways trains with some schedule restrictions, and on every public transport without restrictions when using folding-bikes.
There is no public rent-a-bike service, but there are some rent shops on historical center area such as the company <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.bajabikes.eu/en/bike-tours-madrid">Baja Bikes</a> and Urban Biking <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.urbanbiking.es/">[11]</a>. These companies offers several rental points in Madrid (Retiro, Atocha, Madrid-RÃ­o, etc.). They offer Guided and self-guided bicycle tours, using electric or conventional bicycles.
While knowledge of the English language is increasing among the younger generations, the majority of Madrid's residents know only a few words - even employees at American businesses such as McDonald's or Burger King and employees at cash exchange centers rarely speak much English. You can often find someone with a fair grasp of English at larger hotels and tourism sites, but it would nevertheless be helpful to know at least a few common <a href="/en/Spanish_phrasebook" title="Spanish phrasebook">Spanish words and phrases</a>.
This is Madrid's museum district, named for the three major art museums clustered along Paseo del Prado east of the old city: the Museo del Prado, one of the finest art museums in the world, the Thyssen-Bornemisza, a baron's collection of classical art, and the Reina Sofia, Madrid's modern art museum. However, a couple of smaller museums also occupy the neighborhood which are well worth seeing as well. Its important to note that many of the museums offer free entry during certain times most days. It varies by museum and day, but to if you are looking to take advantage of these beautiful muesums with a lesser budget, it is still possible

Four teams from Madrid play in <i>La Liga</i> (Spain's premier division). The matches between Real Madrid and AtlÃ©tico de Madrid are known as "El Derbi MadrileÃ±o" (English: Madrid Derby).
There are two major teams, <b>Estudiantes</b> and <b>Real Madrid</b>.
<br />
There are a number of cinemas offering American and British films in English (along with films in other languages). These original films are denoted in the listings by a designation of "V.O." which stands for <i>versiÃ³n original</i>. Cinemas in Madrid will sometimes have <i>dÃ­as del espectador</i> (viewer days) with cheaper ticket prices, usually on Mondays or Wednesdays.  Some of the V.O. theaters to check out are:
<br />
There are also a few movie theathers in Madrid where they show the orignial version of the movies subtitled in their original language. The list is provided below.
If you want to go to Madrid to learn Spanish, there are several private language schools that offer Spanish courses for foreigners. Another option is to take a Spanish course at university, the <b>Complutense University of Madrid</b> offers Spanish courses for foreigners that take place in the faculty of Philology and Letters <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.unispain.com/Madrid_Complutense.htm">[63]</a>.
Major credit cards and foreign bank cards are accepted in most stores, but be aware that it is common practice to be asked for photo-ID ("D.N.I."). If asked for your DNI present your passport, residency permit or foreign ID card. Basically anything with your photo and name on it will be accepted by most shopkeepers. The signatures on credit cards are usually not checked.
<br />
In addition to the shopping areas below, there are also a great number of H&amp;M, Zara, Mango, and Blanco stores all over Madrid, with high fashion clothes and accessories at a low price.
<br />
<br />
Dishes popular throughout <a href="/en/Spain#Spanish_dishes" title="Spain">Spain</a> are also widely served in Madrid.
In addition, Madrid has a number of "typical" dishes:
<br />
It is ironic that Madrid, located right in the centre of Spain has higher quality seafood than most coastal regions. This quality comes at a price, and most Spaniards only occasionally shell out for a <i>mariscada</i> (Spanish for "seafood feast"). Experiencing Madrid's seafood may be, for the visitor, an experience which will be worth the cost.
Meat and meat products (Jamon Iberico, morcilla, chorizo etc) are of generally a very high quality in <a href="/en/Spain#Specialties_to_buy" title="Spain">Spain</a> and particularly in Madrid.
Many of the restaurants and <i>cervecerÃ­as</i> in the Sol and Plaza Mayor area have "generic" poster board advertisements on the sidewalks with pictures advertising various paella dishes. These paellas are usually of bad quality and should be avoided. If you are looking for good, authentic Spanish paella, it is usually best to find a more expensive, "sit-down" type of restaurant that offers a variety of paella dishes.
A much better option is the La Latina neighborhood just south of Plaza Mayor, especially along the Cava Baja street. To enjoy a <b>gastronomic tour</b> of this area you can join the Old Madrid Tapas &amp; Wine Tour <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.walksofspain.com/">[80]</a>. There are also a number of deli-like shops along Calle Arenal that offer food <i>para llevar</i> (for take away).
At bars, one generally orders various sized plates, a <i>raciÃ³n</i> meaning a full dish, a <i>media raciÃ³n</i> a half dish or a smaller version which would be a <i>tapa</i>, a <i>pinxto</i> or a <i>pincho</i>.
The Spaniards don't eat lunch until 2 or 3 pm, and dinner doesn't start until 9 or 10 pm. As a rule of thumb, restaurants serve lunch from 1PM (earlier in touristic zones) until 3:30PM, then close and re-open for dinner at 8:00PM, serving until 11:00PM. This schedule is usually for restaurants since bars and "mesones" are usually opened all day long offering a wide variety of "tapas" and "bocadillos"(rolls) for a cheap price. If you're really desperate, the standard bunch of fast food chains do stay open throughout the day.
Where to Eat in Madrid
<br />
<br />
In the tapas bars, you should get free food with your drinks.
Nightlife starts later in Madrid, with most people heading to the bars at 10-11PM.
Clubs generally open at about midnight. If you go in any earlier you may find it quite empty. Many clubs don't close until 6AM, and even then everyone is still full of life.
"Locutorios" (Call Shops) are widely spread in Madrid near touristy locations. In Madrid do it's very easy to find one. Making calls from "Locutorios" tend to be much cheaper, especially international calls (usually made through VoIP). They are usually a good pick for calling home.
When travelling in Spain is not easy getting connected, Internet pre-paid cards can be purchased but with few formalities. Wi-Fi points in bars and cafeterias in Madrid are available after ordering, and most Hotels offer Wi-Fi connection in common areas for their guests.
Prepaid portable WiFi Hot spot service is now available in Spain (provided by tripNETer<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.tripneter.com">[167]</a>) which allows the connection to any WiFi device: Smart-phones, Tablets, PCsâ¦
Madrid is a relatively safe city.  The police are visible, and the city is equipped with cameras.  There are always a lot of people in the streets, even at night time, so you can walk across the city generally without fear.  Travelers who remain aware of their surroundings, and keep an eye on their belongings should have little to worry about.
Madrid has a significant amount of nonviolent <a href="/en/Pickpockets" title="Pickpockets">pickpocket</a> crime so always watch any bags you have with you especially on the Metro and in busier public spaces. It is important for your safety to avoid falling asleep in the metro, which can leave you particularly vulnerable to thefts.  It is not unknown for thieves to cut jean trouser pockets in order to steal belongings.
Be careful when carrying luggage, especially if anyone approaches you with an outspread map in hand asking for directions. This may very possibly be a trap to distract you while an accomplice steals your luggage.
When using ATM machines, be aware of your surroundings, just as you would anywhere.  Bring a friend if you need to withdraw cash after dark.  If someone approaches you while using an ATM, simply hit CANCELAR, retrieve your card and move on.
Beware of thieves preying on people leaving night clubs who have had a lot to drink. Do NOT carry valuables on a night out.
Beware of anyone who approaches you and asks you to write down your signature: it is normally for a "sick hospital" unit, and she will point out the "stamp" on the paper. She will then ask for a generous donation of â¬20 or more.  This distraction can often be used to block vision while a pickpocketing or theft attempt is made.
Be aware of young men and boys who are indicating they are deaf/homeless trying to get you to sign a piece of paper.  This also can be a ruse to distract you in order to steal your belongings. These thieves sometimes enter cafes/bars so make sure you do not leave wallets/phones on the table as possessions on show make for easy targets.
