<b>Abu Dhabi</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.abudhabitourism.ae/">[1]</a> is the federal capital and center of government in the <a href="/en/United_Arab_Emirates" title="United Arab Emirates">United Arab Emirates</a>. It is the largest city of the <a href="/en/Abu_Dhabi_(emirate)" title="Abu Dhabi (emirate)">Emirate of Abu Dhabi</a> and one of the most modern cities in the world.
With a population of just under 1.5 million, Abu Dhabi is the headquarters of numerous oil companies and embassies. With only 420,000 citizens in the entire emirate, each has an average net worth of $17 million.  The city features large gardens and parks, green boulevards lining all the streets and roads, sophisticated high-rise buildings, international luxury hotel chains and opulent shopping malls.
Long viewed as a staid bureaucratic outpost entirely lacking in neighboring Dubai's pizazz, things started to change radically in 2004 after long-ruler Sheikh Zayed passed away and his son Sheikh Khalifa took over.  In a bid to attract tourism and investment, land sales to foreigners were allowed and restrictions on alcohol were loosened.
Homosexuality is currently illegal throughout the United Arab Emirates with possible resulting penalties of deportation, fines, prison time, or the death sentence.
Several <i>massive</i> projects are also under way. <a href="/en/Yas_Island" title="Yas Island">Yas Island</a> hosts Abu Dhabi's Formula 1 track and the new Ferrari theme park, while the upcoming $28 billion cultural zone of Saadiyat Island and its centerpieces the Guggenheim (scheduled to open in 2017) and Louvre Museums (scheduled to open in 2015) have been repeatedly plagued by delays. It remains to be seen how well the strategy will work but the city is certainly experiencing a construction boom.
The core of Abu Dhabi is a wedge-shaped island connected to the mainland by the Maqta and Musaffah bridges.  The wide end of the wedge forms the city center, with the <b>Corniche</b> running along the coast and a road variously known as <b>Airport Rd</b> or <b>Sheikh Rasheed bin Saeed al Maktoum St</b> running lengthwise out to the bridges.
Street addresses in Abu Dhabi are simultaneously very logical and hopelessly confusing.  Many roads have traditional names, like "Airport Rd", which may not correspond to the official names, like "Maktoum St", and the city is divided into traditional districts like "Khalidiyya".  However, by recent decree, the city has been split up into numbered "zones" and "sectors", with all roads in each sector numbered, First St, Second St, etc, and the vast majority of street signs only refer to these. The system of main streets is straight forward enough once you realize that the odd numbered streets run across the island and the even numbers run along it.  So First St is in fact the Corniche, and the odd numbers continue out of town to 31st St which is near the new Khalifa Park.  Airport Rd is Second St and the even numbers continue to the east through to 10th St by Abu Dhabi Mall.  On the west side of Airport Rd, the numbers go from 22nd Street to 32nd St by the new Bateem Marina.  Alas, confusion is caused by the local streets, which are on green signs (main streets are on blue signs) and are also called First, Second etc.  Most locals opt to ignore the system entirely, and the best way to give instructions is thus <b>navigating by landmarks</b>, if taking a taxi, odds are you will get to "behind the Hilton Baynunah" much faster than "Fifth Street, Sector 2".
Abu Dhabi International Airport <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.abudhabiairport.ae/">[2]</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IATA" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:IATA">IATA</a>: <b>AUH</b>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICAO" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:ICAO">ICAO</a>: <b>OMAA</b>) is the UAE's second busiest airport (after Dubai) and the home base of Abu Dhabi's flag carrier Etihad <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.etihadairways.com/">[3]</a>.  Launched in 2003, Etihad Airways has been expanding rapidly and now flies everywhere from the United States to Australia, and its services (particularly on long-haul flights) are remarkably good in all classes.
The airport is separated into Terminal 1 (the original terminal) and Terminal 3 (a new terminal dedicated to Etihad Airways).
Terminal 1 provides a slightly dingy appearance and a spectacularly bizarre blue-lime tiled mushroom canopy that awaits you at the gates. The airport itself is quite well-maintained and has duty-free shopping. However, it can get a little overcrowded at peak hours around midnight. The airport is currently undergoing a major expansion which in early 2011 is still underway. Picking up luggage is also quite easy, although, be forewarned that airport personnel may remove a flight's bags from the carousel and stack them in a pile next to it, as the airport has few baggage carousels.
Terminal 3 is much newer and has improved shopping and gate access.  It is noted that Etihad flights to and from the US utilize the older terminal.
A midfield terminal has been planned for many years.
<b>To/from the airport:</b>
A viable alternative is to fly to Dubai International Airport in the neighbouring emirate of <a href="/en/Dubai" title="Dubai">Dubai</a> and continue onward by bus or, if really in a hurry, by taxi.
<b>To/from Dubai airport:</b>
The five-laned E11 highway between <a href="/en/Dubai" title="Dubai">Dubai</a> and Abu Dhabi is the country's heaviest-traveled route, and the 130-km journey can be covered in two hours.  While there is a national speed limit of 120 km/h, it is allowed to speed up to 140km/h, yet this is often wildly exceeded by some drivers. Stay out of the leftmost lane and drive carefully, especially at night.
To travel directly into Abu Dhabi from Dubai on E11,  keep to your left at Al Shahama and follow the E10 highway, which passes the newly-developed Yas Island (exit at the E12 highway) and Al Raha Beach on the way to the new Sheikh Zayed Bridge into Abu Dhabi City.  This bridge connects directly to Salam Street (8th Street), a newly widened megahighway along the northern shore of Abu Dhabi Island.  There is still significant construction along this route entering the central business district so expect delays and detours.  As an alternative to the Zayed Bridge, there are ramps off E10 that connect to the Maqta Bridge, which leads to both 2nd Street (Airport Road) and 4th Street (East Road or Muroor Road).  During off-peak periods,  these routes run fairly quickly into the City.
Parking can be very challenging in the central business district and business areas around the City.  While there are some free parking areas,  much of the surface parking throughout the City is governed by the Department of Transport's Mawaqif program (www.mawaqif.ae), which allows payment both at curbside meters (receipts displayed on windshield) and through a subscription program that allows you to SMS a parking request after you've pulled into a space.
In the central area, there are limited parking garages (some are in malls such as Al Wahda and Khalidiya which are generally free of charge).
You can get into Abu Dhabi from the other Emirates of Dubai, Sharjah, etc, by bus. The <i>Emirates Express</i> between Abu Dhabi and <a href="/en/Dubai" title="Dubai">Dubai</a> is operated jointly by the Abu Dhabi and Dubai municipalities. The 130 km route takes around two hours. The buses operated by Dubai's RTA are luxury buses that charge 25 Dirhams for the onward journey to Abu Dhabi and 15 Dirhams for the return journey. The Abu Dhabi transport buses charge 15 Dirhams each way. The first bus departs from the Abu Dhabi main bus terminal on the corner of Hazza bin Zayed the First (11th) St and East (4th) Rd at 5:30AM and the last leaves at 11:30PM; they leave at 30 minute intervals, or if the bus gets full sooner. From Dubai, the buses leave from 5:30AM, and run until 11:30PM, from the Al Ghubaiba station in Bur Dubai (opposite Carrefour Shopping). For bus times, see the timetable <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.rta.ae/wpsv5/links/buses/timetable/E102Both.pdf">[4]</a> publishd in the Government of Dubai website.
You can flag down any metered taxi on the street in Dubai or any other place in the UAE and ask to go to Abu Dhabi. The cost between Dubai and Abu Dhabi is about Dhs 250. From Abu Dhabi, taxis cost about Dhs 200 to Dubai.
Abu Dhabi is built for cars.  As a result, there are a lot of them and lots of traffic jams in the down town area.
The best way to get around if you did not rent a car is by taxi. Basic metered fares start from AED 3.50, and getting from one end of town to the other (within city limits) is usually not going to cost more that AED 25, with normal trips within the city costing AED 10 - AED 15. Slightly more luxurious silver cabs, have white signs on top and charge a little more with a Dhs. 3.50 starting fare and Dh. 1 per 750 m thereafter, slightly more at night. They are probably the safer bet in the unruly traffic. Taxis like Al Ghazal and National monopolize the hotels and charge roughly twice what the local Silver or white and gold cabs charge. Alternatively, you can book a taxi in Abu Dhabi by calling 600535353.
The local white and gold cabs or silver cabs are not allowed to pick up passengers from the airport as this service is reserved for the Al Ghazal limousine service, who charge around Dhs. 75 for a trip to the city.
The white and gold taxis are no longer legal. They will not use their meters and require haggling over the fare. Rides to the airport will entail bargaining. The previous fare was between Dhs. 35-50, depending on your race and bargaining ability.
You are not expected to tip cab drivers, but gratuity will be extremely appreciated. Many taxi drivers are displaced persons, far from their home countries and families, so often they take out pictures of family members for you to comment on.
The main Bus station in Abu Dhabi is on Hazaa Bin Zayed Road. You can get buses here going to the different points within the city as well as inter city buses. The bus stand also serves as a taxi stand, for inter-emirate taxis.
The fare system is simple: Dhs. 2 for a single ride within Abu Dhabi City, Dhs. 4 for a single ride on a regional bus, or Dhs. 80 for a one-month <i>Ojra</i> pass. Local buses require exact fare, regional buses including the A1 airport bus will give change. The dark bluish green buses are air-conditioned but not wheelchair accessible. Passengers can board and alight at the designated stops along the route. These locations can be identified by the temporary Department of Transport bus stop poles. Beware: bus stops that do not have the DoT bus stop sign may not be served as not all bus stops along the route are used.
The older bus service, operated by the Abu Dhabi Municipality, operates bus routes within city and to the other emirates. The routes within the city are very few. The buses are very modern and air-conditioned. The services are as punctual as possible and operate more or less around the clock and charge Dhs. 1 for travel within the capital. The front few seats are reserved for ladies, so men should avoid occupying them.<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="//www.ojra.ae/en_index.htm">[5]</a>
Unless they are very aggressive drivers or accustomed to reckless road behaviour, most visitors find the style of driving far too dangerous to be willing to get behind the wheel themselves. Rented cars/visitors are not treated differently if they get into a car accident. Tests for alcohol can also be administered, and even the blood-alcohol level rise from a glass of wine will be sufficient grounds for one month's incarceration.
If you do decide to take the plunge, beware that the street numbering system is unusual and it can take 30-45 days to get used to it. U-turns are allowed at almost every intersection. When the left lane signal turns green, you simply have to swing a U-turn and come back. Whatever other flaws drivers here may have, they do <i>not</i> run red lights. There are cameras at many intersections, fines are high (about Dhs. 550 or $150 US), and residents who are not citizens can be deported for running too many red lights. When the light turns yellow, that taxi in front of you <i>will</i> jam on the brakes, and you should, too. When the light turns green, however, expect someone behind you to honk at you immediately to get you moving.
Unfortunately, despite excellent roads, and a traffic signal system, vehicle accidents remains the largest cause of deaths in the UAE.
Navigating Abu Dhabi on foot is difficult due to the spread-out nature of the city and the oppressive summertime heat and humidity. Pedestrian crossings across the massive boulevards are few and far between.
Abu Dhabi offers little in the way of historical or cultural sights but it certainly isnât lacking in attractions and many of them are free.
Abu Dhabi has several large green spaces, many of which include play areas and equipment for children, and the city is studded with lovely fountains, swathes of neon light, and the occasional sculpture.
There are a vast number of projects coming up in Abu Dhabi.
<b>Helicopter Tour</b> Board a luxurious 6-seater Eurocopter EC130 B4 and Discover Abu Dhabi from a birds' eye view with Falcon Aviation Services.Tours operate daily from 9AM to 5PM out of the Marina Mall Terminal. Reservations recommended (tours can be booked on an individual or private basis)
Abu Dhabi is a compulsive shopper's dream. There are several malls, most of which have the same stores as other malls. Besides establishments aimed at locals, malls also include popular foreign chain stores, as well as designer places. Many visitors will be surprised at the female fashion dichotomy - while local custom calls for women to be covered in public, most stores sell short skirts and halter tops alongside the more sedate floor-length skirts and high-necked shirts.
There are also many small, independent stores around the city. On the bottom floor of one building, a person can purchase fancy chocolates, computer parts, antiques, and clothing. It is better to purchase things like carpets, art, native jewelry, and antiques at the independent or souk-like places than at the malls, as the price will be lower and the shopkeepers more willing to haggle.
Bargaining is a big part of shopping in the Emirates, but be prudent. Don't bargain at Marks and Spencer or Hang Ten. Save your discounting skills for independent shops dealing in antiques and the like.
Shopping in most places can be frustrating, as the clerks will follow you around the store. This is partly due to their concept of what constitutes good service, and partly because there is a shoplifting problem. Most will not be intrusive, but some employees can be very pushy and overly obsequious. Smile and thank them often, and you're more likely to be left alone after a bit.
In carpet stores - or anywhere that sells tapestries, Indian antiques, and the like  don't feel too pressured to buy, and don't be shocked if they start unrolling beautiful rug after beautiful rug at your feet. You are under no obligation to buy, no matter how much time they spend with you. However, the pressure will be very steady, and shyer shoppers may want to travel in packs for comfort's sake.
Grocery stores such as Spinney's, Carrefours, and the Abu Dhabi Cooperative Society are inexpensive and usually stocked with Western goods. Be careful to examine all products before purchasing. Visitors wishing to purchase pork products will likely have to enter a separate room to do so, as no nationals are permitted in these sections of the grocery stores.
Prices in Abu Dhabi tend to be very competitive, and there is no tax.
General discount season - end of the year and midyear. These are the time where you can get some branded items with a very low price, maybe last season stock.
<span class='vcard' id = 'Khalidiya_Mall'><span class="fn org">Khalidiya Mall</span>. <span class="description">The Indian restaurant is called Asha's. It's the one franchise in Abu Dhabi, part of a chain based in Dubai. Named after the popular Bollywood singer, who came up with some of the recipes.

Although Abu Dhabi hosts to a wide range of palates and ethnicities, there isn't much variety when it comes to cuisine. Indian food is relatively cheap, and there are a few Chinese chain restaurants with reasonable prices. Hotel restaurants are usually the most expensive. The city is home to all manner of fast food like McDonald's and Hardees, but there is little call for most people to eat at those places.
The fun thing about Abu Dhabi is that everywhere, literally from tiny falafel shacks to the cushy hotel restaurants to Burger King, delivers to anywhere in the city. Delivery is quick and reliable, and usually doesn't cost extra.
Vegetarians will find the city's selection of meals very satisfying. Vegetable and bean-heavy native dishes, the array of splendid pure vegetarian Indian cuisine, and the ready availability of fresh salads make eating in Abu Dhabi a stress-free experience. Strict vegans may have a little difficulty communicating their precise demands, but most places offer vegan dishes and are always willing to accommodate a paying customer. The best choice for pure Vegans would be one of the many Indian veg restaurants like Evergreen, Sangeetha in Tourist Club area.
Visitors should always check the Islamic calendar to determine whether they will be visiting during the month of Ramadan.  Since Muslims fast during daylight hours, restaurants are, by law, closed during the day.  It is also against the law to eat or drink anything, even water, in public and tourists (and non-Muslim residents) have been arrested and given fines.  Large hotels generally have one restaurant open during the day to serve meals to non-Muslims.  During the evening, however, it's quite a different story, as the festive atmosphere of <i>iftar</i> (breaking the fast) begins and residents gather for lavish, Thanksgiving-like meals.  As long as you don't mind tiding yourself over in private, the evening meals are magnificent.
<br />
Some of the cheapest (but not necessarily good) food in the city can be found at its many Indian restaurants. Portions are almost always generous, prices low, and quality excellent. Set meals of rice, fish curry, lentil curry (<i>dhal</i>), peppery soup (<i>rasam</i>), a vegetable side dish and perhaps a small fried fish, served on a large steel tray (<i>thali</i>) with little steel bowls for the accompaniments, can go for as low as Dhs.5.
Only restaurants located in hotels are allowed to serve alcohol. Therefore, all nightlife is associated with hotels. The drinking age is 21, but most places don't care. Unlike some other Middle Eastern nations, the bars in Abu Dhabi will be able to accommodate most drink orders.
Technically, you are supposed to purchase a permit to buy alcohol for private storage, although Spinney's and other liquor stores usually take proof that you aren't a local Muslim (a military ID or driver's license.)
<br />
Hotels in Abu Dhabi used to be half price compared to Dubai but no longer, with many hotels charging above US$150 per night.  However, all are well-tended and host to first class restaurants, pools and other high-end hotel facilities.
Other luxury hotels include:
Abu Dhabi has many job opportunities for those willing to take the plunge and move. Oil companies, construction firms, banks - they all hire Westerners as managerial staff. The lower-skilled jobs are, as always in the UAE, usually worked by people from India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Starting a few years ago, the Abu Dhabi Education Council has been hiring English speaking teachers from Western countries to reform the public school system in Abu Dhabi. Several hundred teachers are needed every year, so any Western teacher looking for an opportunity in Abu Dhabi can contact an <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.teachaway.com/teaching-public-schools-abu-dhabi/">official recruiter</a> and work in the Emirate for a handsome, tax-free salary.
