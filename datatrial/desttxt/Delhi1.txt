<b>Delhi</b> (<a href="/en/Hindi" title="Hindi" class="mw-redirect">Hindi</a>: à¤¦à¤¿à¤²à¥à¤²à¥, <a href="/en/Urdu" title="Urdu" class="mw-redirect">Urdu</a>: Ø¯ÙÙÛ, <a href="/en/Punjabi" title="Punjabi" class="mw-redirect">Punjabi</a>: à¨¦à¨¿à©±à¨²à©) <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://delhigovt.nic.in">[1]</a> is <a href="/en/India" title="India">India</a>'s capital city and the home of executive, legislative, and judiciary branches of the Government of India. Delhi is known as the microcosm of India and is leading worldâs top global cities with strengths in arts, commerce, education, entertainment, fashion, finance, healthcare, media, professional services, research and development, tourism and transport all contributing to its prominence.
Delhi is said to be one of the oldest existing cities in the world, along with <a href="/en/Jerusalem" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> and <a href="/en/Varanasi" title="Varanasi">Varanasi</a>. Legend estimates it to be over 5,000 years old. Over the millennia, Delhi is said to have been built and destroyed 11 times. The oldest alleged incarnation of the city shows up in the Indian mythological epic <i>Mahabharata</i> as <b>Indraprastha</b>.
The population of Delhi is a heterogeneous mix of people originally belonging to different parts of North India and beyond. Among the prominent North Indian communities are the Punjabis.  Delhi also has a prominent South Indian Community, primarily in areas like RK Puram, Mayur Vihar and Munirka. A Bengali Settlement, the Chittaranjan Park in south Delhi is the Mini Calcutta of Delhi.  Quality education also draws students from different states, making up one of the most diverse student populations in the country.
To be noted is the fact that the descendants of the builders of Delhi's many Muslim monuments no longer stay in Delhi. Most of them migrated to Pakistan during the Partition, with only a small, ever-diminishing community in old Delhi keeping old courtly traditions alive.
Like the rest of the Gangetic Plains, Delhi is as flat as a pancake.  The only geographical features of any significance are the river Yamuna, which flows down the eastern side of the city, and the Aravalli Hills which form a wide but low arc across the west.  On the west bank is the crowded and congested Old (Central) Delhi and, to the southwest, the broad, tree-lined avenues of New Delhi, built by the British to rule their empire.  The rest is an endless low-rise sprawl of suburbia and slums, with southwestern Delhi (nearer to New Delhi) generally somewhat wealthier.
Indeed, on a broad scale Delhi is not difficult to navigate. The Outer Ring Road, and Ring Road, offer simple connections between districts. In South Delhi, most of the major districts lie on either the inner or outer ring roads.
Travelling west on the Ring Road from Nizammudin, the following colonies lie in the following order, Friends Colony, Lajpat Nagar, Defence Colony, South Extention, INA, Safdarjung, Bikhaji Kama Place, RK Puram, Chankyapuri, Dhaula Kuan.
And on the outer Ring Road, travelling west from Okhla, the following colonies lie in the following order,Nehru Place, Kalkaji, GK2, GK1, CR Park, Panchsheel Park, Hauz Khas Enclave, Safdarjung Enclave, Munirka, Vasant Vihar.
The only major areas that lie in between the Ring Roads as opposed to adjacent to them are are Anand Niketan, Hauz Khas Village, Green Park. However, these areas are easily accessible from Shanti Path, Aurobindo Marg, and Khel Gaon Marg respectively.
Inside the colonies it is another issue, often akin to mazes, finding your way around the inside of any colony other than Vasant Vihar or Chanakyapuri is not for the faint hearted.
Delhi's climate is, sad to say, infamously bad, combining the scorching aridity of Rajasthan's deserts with the frigid cold of the Himalayas.  From April to June, temperatures are scorchingly hot (over 40&#176;C is common) and, with every air-conditioner running at full blast, the city's creaking power and water infrastructure is strained to the breaking point and beyond.  Monsoon rains deluge the city from July to September, flooding roads on a regular basis and bringing traffic to a standstill.  In winter, especially December and January, temperatures can dip to near-zero which can feel a lot colder because central heating is largely unknown and homes are usually designed with a view to keep cool in the summers rather than warm in the winters. In addition the city is blanketed in thick fog, causing numerous flight cancellations and train delays.  The shoulder seasons (Feb-Mar and Oct-Nov) are comparatively pleasant, with temperatures in the 20-30&#176;C range (68-86&#176;F), but short.
<b>Indira Gandhi International Airport</b>, (IGI, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IATA" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:IATA">IATA</a>: <b>DEL</b>) <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://newdelhiairport.in/">[2]</a>, located in the west of the city, is the arrival point for many visitors into Delhi.  Once notoriously bad, since privatization the airport has been extensively revamped and, with the opening of Terminal 3 in 2010, has been transformed into a thoroughly modern facility equivalent to the best airports in the world.
Delhi Airport has no less than six terminals, but only two are currently operational:
A free shuttle bus operates between the two every 20 min.  While the terminals share the same runways, connecting between the two requires a massive detour via a nearby highway, so allow plenty of time to connect.
The Delhi Airport Metro Express (DAME) is a Delhi Metro train line from New Delhi Metro Station to Dwarka Sector 21, passing through the airport. Its operating timings are from 5AM-11PM every 20 minutes (as of April 2011). In the future, the trains <i>may</i> run 24 hr/day. The one-way fare between the airport and New Delhi Metro Station is Rs 150. The journey time is 20 min. From the railway station, you can transfer to the Metro (it's a bit of hike though), continue by taxi, or simply walk to backpacker ghetto Paharganj.
<br />
There are also public buses to and from the city throughout the day and night. Travel time is approximately 50 minutes. There are two bus companies: Delhi Transport Corporation (green-yellow buses) and EATS (white-blue buses). The EATS (Ex Serviceman's Airlink Transport Service) Buses run to ISBT (Inter State Bus Terminal) near Kashmiri Gate, Connaught Place, Delhi Train Station and many hotels in the city centre, departing from both airport terminals every 60 minutes from 10AM-11:10PM. The Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) (schedule: <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.delhi.gov.in/wps/wcm/connect/DOIT_DTC/dtc/all+services/special+services+of+delhi+ncr+to+igi+airport">[3]</a>) offers 8 bus routes to both the city center and the more outlying areas of Delhi. Tickets can be bought and a fixed seat can be booked at a desk in the Arrivals Hall. One way fare for both companies: Rs 50 per adult, Rs 25 per child below 12 years, Rs 25 for heavy luggage.
If you'd prefer to go directly to your destination and are willing to sit around in traffic, or are arriving on the many long-distance flights that land in the dead of night, take a <b>taxi</b>.  The easiest and safest way is to arrange transport <i>ahead of time</i> through your hotel (some hotels provide this service for free).   Alternatively, you can pay for a taxi at the prepaid taxi booths in the international terminal. Prefer the pre-paid booth run by Delhi Police. Depending on the destination, they will ask you to pay the taxi fare to them, which they later pay to the taxi driver after he shows a receipt from you proving that you were taken to your destination. The pre-paid booths are visible as soon as you exit customs. The one on the left is managed by the Delhi police. You may be approached by touts offering pre-paid taxis; just ignore them and ask someone the direction to the Delhi Police prepaid taxi kiosk or booth managed by the cops. To the right of the exit door are private taxi operators. They are more expensive but the cars are air-conditioned. The number of the taxi assigned to you will be on the receipt. Then, go straight through the airport and turn right immediately outside the front doors and someone will help you find your taxi. There are several options, but the booth operated by the "Delhi Police" is considered the best, with non-A/C taxis to most points in the city for Rs 200-300.
Do <b>not</b> give the receipt to the driver until you get to the destination as this is what they are paid on. Also, ignore the explanation of the driver for additional payment.  There is no practice of tipping taxi drivers anywhere in India. When you reach your destination, take your baggage first, then give the driver the receipt and walk away without further discussion.
There is a minor problem with this system. As there is a checkpoint manned by the traffic police just as your taxi moves away from the airport, you will have to give the receipt to the driver, who will hand it over to the police, who will record the taxi number. Make sure that you get the receipt back from the driver  only after you have safely reached your destination.
When leaving Delhi from the international terminal, you should show up three hours before your flight is scheduled as security is tight. For domestic flights two hours should be enough.  While sometimes time-consuming, the process is smooth, and the new terminal's shops and restaurants are sensibly located at the gate area, not before security. However, if you wish to change Rupees back into foreign currency, you must do this before clearing security.
During the winter (Dec-Jan), Delhi often experiences <b>dense fog</b> and visibility is reduced considerably, making it difficult for flights to land and take off. Both international and domestic flights are often diverted or cancelled, so plan accordingly and allow for <b>one or two days for possible delays</b>.
<b>Buses</b> arrive from <a href="/en/Kathmandu" title="Kathmandu">Kathmandu</a> and <a href="/en/Chitwan" title="Chitwan" class="mw-redirect">Chitwan</a> in <a href="/en/Nepal" title="Nepal">Nepal</a> (36 hr+) and virtually every city in India.  Although not as comfortable as the trains, buses are the only choice for some destinations, mainly those in the mountains.
Delhi has a confusing slew of inter-state bus termini (ISBT), which all have two names.  The Delhi Transport Corporation <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://dtc.nic.in/dt4.htm">[4]</a> is the major operator, but every state also runs its own buses and there are some private operators too.
<b>Trains</b> arrive at one of four main stations: <b>Delhi Junction</b>, also called Old Delhi or <i>Purani Dilli</i>; the second at <b>New Delhi</b> which lies in Central Delhi; <b>Hazrat Nizamuddin</b> a few kilometers to the south; and the upcoming <b>Anand Vihar</b> station to the east (very few trains use Delhi Sarai Rohilla or Delhi Cantt stations).  Delhi Junction and New Delhi Railway Station are now conveniently connected by Metro Line 2, just minutes apart, while Anand Vihar is served by Line 3.  It will take about 40 min-1 hr to travel from the New Delhi Railway Station to the airport by car, depending on traffic.
A <b>ticket office</b> open to all is on the road to Connaught Place with longer hours. It often has waiting times not much longer than at the tourist booking office. You will need to know the number or name of the train you want to take.  Easiest of all, though, is to book online through the Indian Railways booking website <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://indianrail.gov.in/">[5]</a>.  (Note, however, that you are required to have both an e-mail address AND a mobile phone number that is registered within India in order to access the booking area of the site.)
Once you have purchased a ticket either at the ticket office or online prior to the trip, all you need to do is go to the rail car labeled with your class of service purchased.  You can either get on and sit in the first available seat or often times for higher classes of service, they will post a passenger list on the car when it stops.  Look for your name and go to the assigned car, cabin and seat.  There is never a need to get a boarding pass so if anyone comes out of the crowd to tell you that, don't listen to them; it is a scam.  If you're brave, you can simply purchase a general 2nd class ticket and then get on any car where there is availability.  The conductor will come by and check your tickets after the train starts moving.  If you are in a higher fare class than you are ticketed for, all you have to do is simply pay the difference in fare to the conductor.  The only risk here is that the train could be full and you could be stuck in the lowest fare class which can be very crowded with little room to sit.
The main entrance to <b>New Delhi Railway Station</b> (code <i>NDLS</i>) is located just outside of Paharganj, also known as the backpacker ghetto.  The Delhi Metro now connects directly here, but the metro exits are at the Ajmeri Gate (second entrance) side near platform 16.  You can also take prepaid rickshaws and taxis from the  plaza outside the main entrance.
The station is large, crowded, confusing and packed with touts. Allow <i>one hour</i> to find your train the first time you visit.  Don't trust the electronic display boards, which often show incorrect information. Instead listen to the announcements and ask multiple people in uniform (policemen) until you find your train.  However, anyone who approaches you spontaneously should be <b>completely ignored</b>. Use one of the porters (in orange red uniforms with metallic arms badges) to find your train and carry your luggage, in exchange for a tip.
A tourist ticket office called the <b>International Tourist Bureau</b> is open during office hours upstairs of, but still within, the main New Delhi railway station on Platform No.1 (on the side away from the metro). Note that it is only for foreign tourists, so you <i>must</i> have a tourist visa (i.e. student and working visas are not acceptable). Non-resident Indians can also book their tickets through this office. Bring your passport and cash or traveller's cheques in U.S. dollars, British Pounds or Euros. If you wish to pay in Indian Rupees you theoretically <i>must</i> show an official exchange certificate (from India, not valid if you changed in another country) or an ATM receipt. All ticket bookings require exact change, as like everywhere in India the office has little to no change. If you don't have exact change, it's possible after booking to go down to the food stores, buy food to get change, then return and pick up your ticket. To get a ticket, first get a form from the centre of the room and fill it out.  Then go to the information desk near the entrance.  There, have the clerk check the availability of the train(s) you desire, and fill out your form accordingly.  Then line up at one of the two u-shaped lines of chairs for the reservation desks. If you need a bathroom during this lengthy process, there is a relatively clean male and female toilet just outside on the verandah through the side door (the door you didn't enter through).
<b>Do not</b> trust strangers who appear out of the crowd to help you;  <b>ignore</b> them. Always ask for assistance at the enquiry counter or policemen (in uniform).
New Delhi Railway Station also has a pre-paid taxi booth run by Delhi Police. If you are arriving at the station, and want to take a taxi, head to the Delhi Police pre-paid taxi booth. Unfortunately, this booth is at the extreme far north end (about 50 meters from the station main exit) of the taxi parking and you will encounter touts claiming to provide prepaid taxi; just ignore them and find the pre-paid taxi booth run by the Delhi Police which are safe and least expensive. Taxi fare from New Delhi Railway Staion to the Airport should cost you about 400 Rupees.
Formally <b>Delhi Junction</b> (code <i>DLI</i>), but best referred to as "Old" Delhi Station for clarity.  Like New Delhi RS, this station is huge and confusing. The platforms are <i>not</i> in linear order, with some hidden in the west and east wings of the stations.  The railway station is served by Metro Line 2 Chandni Chowk station, with an entrance just outside at the east end of the station and also just over the main road outside (last metro at about 23:30). If taking an Auto Rickshaw from here, the prepaid desk will often try and charge you as much as three times the actual price quoted on the official price guide displayed clearly in their window - bargaining is sadly often cheaper.
<b>Hazrat Nizamuddin</b> (code <i>NZM</i>) is the departure point of many trains heading south.  Practically speaking, the only way to get here is by taxi or car.  The budget alternative is to take a bus to the Sarai Kale Khan Inter State Bus Terminal (ISBT) on the ring road and then walk over to the station (400 m). It's the least chaotic of the <i>Big Three</i>, but still pretty big and poorly signposted; listen to the announcements to figure out your train.  The station has a pretty good food court that sells inexpensive, hygienic takeaway snacks including sandwiches and samosas.
If you have some time to kill, pay a visit to Humayun's Tomb, which is so close to the station that you can hear the announcements from inside â although it's a long, circuitous walk from the station to the entrance.
<b>Anand Vihar Terminal</b> (code <i>ANVT</i>) is Delhi's newest station, located well to the east of the city near <a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Ghaziabad_-_Delhi_Border&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Ghaziabad - Delhi Border (page does not exist)">Ghaziabad - Delhi Border</a>.  Repeatedly delayed, the station finally opened in December 2009 and will gradually take over all east-bound services.  The station can be reached by Delhi Metro Line 3. Anand Vihar Terminal is just opposite to Anand Vihar Interstate Bus Terminal (ISBT).

Getting around Delhi is always an adventure.  Traffic is, by and large, horribly congested and many drivers will think nothing of quoting ten times the going price to a tourist.  Use the prices below as broad guidelines, agree on prices <i>before</i> setting off.  Best way to travel is via metro, where there are separate cabins for women (that prove to be very useful during rush hour).  Metro is clean, efficient, and typically ridden by relatively affluent middle-class students or commuters en route to/from work; there is almost nowhere in the city that you cannot get to by metro.
The fast-growing <b>Delhi Metro</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://delhimetrorail.com/">[6]</a> network provides a cheap, quick, hassle-free and air-conditioned way of zipping around the city.  As of February 2011, the following lines are open:
<br />
<br />
Fares range from Rs 8-30, just buy a token, change lines as necessary, and deposit the token in the slot as you exit. Tokens can be used only from the station they are bought, so you can't buy two and use the second to return home.  If you're planning on sticking around for a while, you can buy a "Smart Card" for Rs 100, which is worth Rs 50 and includes a Rs 50 deposit; using this saves 10% and, more importantly, lets you avoid the queues.  There is also a "Tourist Card" allowing unlimited use for Rs 100 (1 day) or Rs 250 (3 days), but it's highly unlikely that you'll travel enough to make this pay off.  Special fares apply for travel on the <a href="#By_plane">Airport Express</a>.
Line 2, in particular, is useful for getting to the Old Delhi (Chandni Chowk, Jama Masjid) and New Delhi railway stations, the ISBT bus terminal, the backpacker ghetto of Paharganj, Hauz Khas and Qutub Minar.  Line 3 is also handy for visiting Akshardham and accessing the western parts of Paharganj through RK Ashram Marg station.
Beware: Metro stations all use the new, official, Indianized names, so Connaught Place is "Rajiv Chowk", Old Delhi Railway Station is "Chandni Chowk" and ISBT is "Kashmere Gate".
The head of all trains is reserved to women, so, is totally safe and confortable to travel with the metro lines also for a woman by herself.
There are limited commuter services on Delhi's railways, but the facilities are a far cry from the user-friendly Metro and stations. For the most part, train stations are inconveniently located.  There is no passenger service on the Delhi Ring Railroad outside rush hour.
<b>Please note that the Indian Railways website does not accept most foreign credit cards, however American Express cards are accepted.</b>.
All parts of Delhi are well connected by buses and with tickets ranging from Rs 5-15 they are very cheap, but they are also quite crowded most of the time. The red coloured buses are air-conditioned and the green coloured are not. As bus stops do not have bus routes written properly, it can be difficult to find your way. Asking other people at the bus stop is often the best way to find out about bus routes to your destination. However, the buses are pretty frequent, running every 15-20 min or so on most routes. There are two kinds of buses in Delhi:
If you have a choice, please go for a DTC bus. They will stop less frequently and will generally be less crowded too.  Note that many buses, DTC ones too, will stop pretty much anywhere if there are enough people getting on or off.
Board buses at the back and pay the ticket seller sitting right next to the door. Be sure to hang onto your tickets, as ticket checks are fairly frequent.  Some seats on the left side of the bus may be reserved for women and the handicapped.  When it's time to disembark, move to the front of the bus.  As you might expect, all these guidelines are regularly ignored when buses are very crowded.
Delhi Tourism has a "Hop On Hop Off (HOHO)" bus service <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.hohodelhi.com">[8]</a>, (Helpline) â +91 11 4094 0000. A fleet of air conditioned low floored buses follow a pre-defined set of stops around the city and passengers can <i>hop</i> off the bus, see the place at one's own convenience and <i>hop</i> on the next bus.Each bus is staffed with a knowledgeable English speaking guide. The service does not operate on Mondays.  Delhi Tourism's Hop-On-Hop-Off Sightseeing bus takes you to 20+ tourist attractions of Delhi including World Heritage Monuments, Museums and Colorful Shopping markets. The tour offers you Low Floor AC Buses with live commentary delivered by knowledgeable and entertaining guides in both English and Hindi. The Hop-On, Hop-Off facility will enable you to get on and off the bus at many places of your choice. The Tour includes two routes- Red &amp; Green, you can choose to take 1 day or 2 day validity pass. Your sightseeing tour of Delhi offers you a choice of exploring nearby areas around the tourist spots. Like Jama masjid, Chandni Chowk, Spice market situated around Red Fort and many such popular places. Hop On Hop Off Sightseeing Tour is a safe and relaxed way to experience this great city and it is the perfect introduction to Delhi and a fun day out for all.
A <b>taxi</b> or <b>hired car</b> (usually with driver) is required to see many of the far-flung sites within and around Delhi. However, the metro is a far cheaper and equally comfortable option.
Most Delhi taxis are old but reliable CNG-run Ambassadors or <i>Omnis</i> in distinctive <b>black-and-yellow</b> livery and a green stripe. The hired family car of choice is usually a <i>Toyota Innova</i> or <i>Chevrolet Tavera</i>. While all are equipped with meters and <i>should</i> cost Rs 15 for the first km Rs 8.50 per km, the meters are often rigged and it's better to agree on the price in advance.  Most trips around the city should be Rs 200-500, while a trip to the airport would be higher, depending on starting location.  An eight-hour charter should cost around Rs 1,500, and a tip is expected if the driver is helpful. The prices would also depends upon the vehicle size too. Note that black and yellow taxis are not air-conditioned. Even if they do have air conditioning, you will be charged extra (and the rates are up to the driver, so bargain hard).
The death knell of the Ambassador was rung in December 2006, when modern <b>radio taxi</b> services were launched.  At Rs 20/km, they're more the list price of the competition, but they use modern vehicles with air-conditioning and GPS and can be dialed 24 hr/day. The flag fare is Rs 20, and the fare increases by Rs 5 for every 250 m after the first km. If you need an SUV, you need to inform the company in advance, but the fare remains the same. Night charges (25% extra) apply between 11pm to 5am. Book up to a few hours in advance. Many corporates rely on these cabs for their daily commute and they may be booked during office hours. Tipping is not expected. After booking, you will receive an SMS with the car license plate number, and the driver's name and mobile number. Usually the driver will call you and inform you that he's arrived. Most drivers speak English, but at a very basic level, so use short phrases.
Best Tourist Vehicle Are: 
Indica , Indigo, Swift Desire, Toyota Etios, Toyota Corolla and Innova
You shouldn't take non-official taxis, sometimes they take you to a wrong hotel, or to a "tourist information centre", and try to sell you overpriced things. These are generally known to fleece and rip off tourists. It is better to keep a safe distance from these guys.
Some other car rental providers like www.qcabs.com <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.qcabs.com">[9]</a> provides cabs from economy class to high end executive class cars for outstation travel from Delhi, and estimates the price of your travel beforehand.
<b>Taxi booking website:</b>
<b>Auto rickshaws</b> (also called <b>three-wheeled scooters</b>, <b>tuk-tuks</b> or simply <b>autos</b>) are good for shorter trips. Always in a distinctive <b>yellow-and-green</b> livery, auto rickshaws are three-wheeled partially enclosed contraptions (no doors!) that run on CNG and can seat three people in the back.  In general, they are much cheaper than taxis and can be hailed from the street.  Although by law the rickshaw drivers should charge according to the meter in their vehicle (Rs 25 for the first two kms, Rs 8/km after), this rate is unrealistically low and they will almost always try to <a href="/en/Haggle" title="Haggle" class="mw-redirect">haggle</a> for price. In May 2013, base rates increased from 19 to 25 Rs and from 6.5 Rs to 8 Rs/km thereafter. Many drivers have not updated their electronic meters and will use this as a way to haggle for vastly more money - "This is old rate, new rate Rs 80!" If their meter says 19 Rs when you get in, they aren't lying about not having updated, but are likely exaggerating the new rate, which should only be roughly 25% higher than the displayed rate, not double or triple as some will claim. As rules of thumb, expect even the shortest journey to cost Rs 30-40 regardless of the meter, but you should never need to pay over Rs 150 for any trip within the city. If you're overquoted, don't be afraid to walk away. It's usually easy to find another one soon, usually with a driver who won't rip you off.
If you have any trouble with them, go to any of the numerous tourist police stations in the city center and they will give you a complaint slip which will result in a Rs 500 fine for the auto driver.  There should also be a telephone number written on the vehicle to call in case of any complaint.
There are a number of "Pre-paid" Auto stands run by the Police.  Tell them where you want to go and pay them upfront. The charge will include Rs 5 for the service.  You then take the coupon and stand outside where a policeman will direct you to the next available Auto.  When your journey is completed you hand the coupon to the auto driver and that's it.  Nothing more to pay (despite what they may say).
Cycle rickshaws are three-wheeled, pedal-powered rickshaws with seats in the back to seat passengers and a driver in the front. They are good for short distances, or places which are too far to walk but too short for taking a bus/taxi/auto rickshaw. Cycle rickshaws don't use meters, so establish a price before getting on. Rs 20 is reasonable for most journeys of 1-2 km.
Cycle rickshaws are best to use in Old Delhi to visit the intricate <i>galis</i> (walkways) and to enjoy the smells and sounds of the city.
Much of Delhi is quite pedestrian-hostile.  Distances are long, road signage is poor, and in the more tourist oriented areas, you'll be constantly accosted by beggars and touts.  Crossing roads often involves wading across multiple lanes of heavy traffic. Try your best to move in a predictable straight line, so vehicles can weave around you.  (Better yet, latch onto a group of locals and cross in their shadow.) If you really want to walk around, these places would be good:
The native language of the Delhi area is <a href="/en/Hindi_phrasebook" title="Hindi phrasebook">Hindi</a>, which also happens to be the main official language of the Union Government. However, for official purposes, English is more widely used than Hindi. Almost everybody you meet will be able to speak Hindi, quite often with the Bihari and Punjabi accents. However, most educated people will also be fluent in English, and many shopkeepers and taxi drivers will have a functional command of English.  <a href="/en/Punjabi_phrasebook" title="Punjabi phrasebook">Punjabi</a> and <a href="/en/Urdu" title="Urdu" class="mw-redirect">Urdu</a> are also official languages, but they are spoken much less widely. The Hindi spoken in Delhi is quite Persianized, similar to the Hindi spoken in <a href="/en/Uttar_Pradesh" title="Uttar Pradesh">Western UP</a> and much less Sanskritized than the Hindi spoken in <a href="/en/Madhya_Pradesh" title="Madhya Pradesh">MP</a>. Signage is usually bilingual in Hindi and English, but some road signs (especially in South and Central Delhi) are in Hindi, English, Punjabi and Urdu. Announcements on the metro are in Hindi (male voice) and English (female voice).
Delhi is a <a href="/en/Wikitravel:Huge_city_article_template" title="Wikitravel:Huge city article template">huge city</a>, so all individual listings should be moved to the appropriate <b><a href="#Districts">district articles</a></b>, and this section should contain a brief overview.

The staff at the Delhi <b>tourist office</b> is very helpful, and the office has a lot of free information:
<b>The Government of India Tourist Office</b> 88 Janpath, Connaught Place.  â +91 11 2332 0005, +91 11 2332 0008, +91 11  2332 0109, +91 11 2332 0266. The Government of India Tourist Office offers daily tours, covering all of the major Delhi sites. If you should choose to go with the government-sanctioned day tour, be aware that due to the heavy agenda, you will need to have a quick foot, only 20-40 min are given for each sight, which is next to no time. Consider this day tour as a sampler. If there is a sight of particular interest, bookmark it and return at a later date.
<b>Beware</b><br />
There are various private "tourist information" offices around Connaught Place openly claiming to be the official government tourist office. They're actually just travel agents that have nothing to do with The Government of India, and since they prey on tourists, anything you buy from them will be grossly overpriced compared to doing it yourself.
The <b>Red Fort</b> (<i>Lal Qila</i>) is one of Delhi's top tourist sights. A brilliant red sandstone fort built by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan (who also built <a href="/en/Agra" title="Agra">Agra</a>'s Taj Mahal) as his ruling palace.  Completed in 1648, the years since have not treated the buildings kindly: the rooms have long since been stripped of all objects, the marble inlays are long gone and quite a few buildings are off limits.  Still, the scale remains imposing and the gardens are kept lush and green even in midwinter.  Major buildings within include:
The only open entrance is <b>Lahore Gate</b>, on the west side.  Security in and around the Fort is very heavy, as it was the scene of a terrorist attack in 2000 that killed three people. Bags are allowed, but they'll be X-rayed and you'll be patted down.  Tickets cost Rs 10/250 rupees for Indians/foreigners, photography free, video cameras Rs 25 extra.  Open sunrise to sunset daily except Monday.  Allow for 3-4 hr in your schedule in case of long weekends and national holidays as lot of tourists flock around then. The most scenic way of reaching the fort is to take the Metro to Chawri Bazaar and then a cycle-rickshaw through the incredibly packed bazaar to the Fort (price negotiable, aim for Rs 20).
The fort has a <b>light and sound show</b> (Rs 50) in the evenings from 7:30PM-9PM, depending on the season.
Be careful buying tickets at the booth, as the ticket sellers will attempt to shortchange you.  Try to have a small bill. Due to enhanced security the parking can be a bit tricky as the walk from the now distanced away parking at nearby alternative slots is quite a bit. The congested traffic makes crossing the road even trickier.
<b>Humayun's Tomb</b> in south Delhi, near Hazrat Nizamuddin station, is one of Delhi's three <a href="/en/UNESCO_World_Heritage_Site" title="UNESCO World Heritage Site" class="mw-redirect">UNESCO World Heritage Sites</a>.  Open daily from sunrise to sunset, entry is Rs 10/250, Indians/foreigners.
The tomb is in large, immaculately maintained gardens in the Persian <i>Char Bagh</i> (four corners) style that were thoroughly renovated in 2003 with the Aga Khan's help and are consequently probably the best in Delhi.  As you enter the complex, the first major structure on your right is the bulbous, octagonal <b>tomb of Iza Khan</b>, a court noble who built it in his own lifetime, some 20 years before Humayun's tomb.  As you pass through the first gate, you will glimpse the dome of the tomb and enter a floral path leading to the second (West) gate, which now acts as the entrance to the giant central garden.
The centerpiece is the eponymous <b>tomb of Humayun</b>, the second Mughal emperor.  Built starting in 1562, it was the first major Mughal structure in the city and has been described as a predecessor or prototype of <a href="/en/Agra" title="Agra">Agra</a>'s Taj Mahal.  The structures are, indeed, stylistically similar, although Humayun's Tomb is built from red sandstone, not white marble, and was built by a wife grieving for her husband, not the other way around.  You can climb up to the second level (the stairs on the west side are very steep, those on the south side less so), and on the south side you will find the entrance into the main crypt where Humayun is buried.
Before you leave, be sure to visit the South Gate, the original royal entrance, from where you can get picture-postcard views without too many tourists in the way.  In the southeast corner is the <b>Barber's Tomb</b>, also built in the same style. Historians do not know who is buried in this picturesque tomb made of red and grey sandstone.
This complex in Mehrauli, houses structures dating from the Slave Dynasty (1206-1290) and is designated as a <a href="/en/UNESCO_World_Heritage_Site" title="UNESCO World Heritage Site" class="mw-redirect">UNESCO World Heritage Site</a>.  The gardens are kept in excellent shape, making this a popular relaxation and picnic spot.  Open daily from sunrise to sunset, entry is 20/250 rupees Indians/foreigners.  Light-and-sound show held most nights after sunset.  Now easily accessible via Qutub Minar station on the Metro Yellow Line.
Very cool.
Delhi is a key centre of learning in India. The most famous universities in Delhi are JNU, DU, JMI, IGNOU, IIT and NLU, Delhi. The official website of the Delhi Government's Directorate of Education <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://delhi.gov.in/wps/wcm/connect/DOIT_Education/education/home">[39]</a> is a good starting point for learning more about study opportunities in Delhi.
Apart from undergraduate, postgraduate and doctoral courses, there are many training and diploma-level institutes and polytechnics that cater to the growing demand for skill-based and vocational education. Besides conventional educational institutes, more and more foreigners also make the effort to learn Hindustani language (Hindi-Urdu) and Delhi is these languages.
Delhi's economy is expanding rapidly. In analogy many interesting work opportunities emerge. Monster <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.monsterindia.com">[40]</a> and other online job platforms are a good starting point to see what kind of jobs are on offer. Traditionally foreigners often work in the social sector or in teaching. Increasingly, however, expats work for multinational companies and even local Indian companies.
There is a great variety of employment opportunities in Delhi for foreigners, whether they would like to work in business, NGOs, educational institutes, or even government. Still, there is one caveat: the labour market in Delhi is highly competitive and so at many prestigious organisations, the number of applicants far exceeds the number of positions available, which allows employers to receive highly talented applicants for rather meagre salaries (especially when compared to other international destinations).
Delhi is a shopper's heaven, but only if you're not afraid to haggle and bump elbows in bazaars. Western-style malls and shopping emporiums are popping up across the city especially in <a href="/en/Gurgaon" title="Gurgaon">Gurgaon</a>, <a href="/en/Noida" title="Noida">Noida</a> and South Delhi, but don't expect a traditional or uniquely Indian shopping experience.  Until a few years ago, all shops closed on Sunday. While rules have been relaxed, many districts such as Connaught Place are still mostly shuttered.  Saturday is the main shopping day and hence also the most crowded.
Start your shopping tour of Delhi with a visit to <b>Connaught Place</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://connaughtplacemall.com/">[41]</a>, a rather unique cross between a European shopping arcade, an Indian bazaar and an upmarket shopping mall.  At the intersection of the Yellow and Blue Lines of the <b>Delhi Metro</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://delhimetrorail.com/commuters/index.html">[42]</a>, it's easy to get to. With all shops laid out in 2 circles, it's easy to get around and explore.

Delhi is rapidly becoming a 'mall crazy' city with a variety of large and luxury shopping malls:
Adjacent and connected to Emporio are a further two malls;
and
The Indian book industry is huge, producing annually about 15,000 books in English, and obviously far more in Hindi and other native languages. Delhi is hub of this industry, so small, specialist bookstores abound. Locally produced books can be very inexpensive and many popular Western titles are published and available here for a fraction of their original cost.
Delhi is a <a href="/en/Wikitravel:Huge_city_article_template" title="Wikitravel:Huge city article template">huge city</a>, so all individual listings should be moved to the appropriate <b><a href="#Districts">district articles</a></b>, and this section should contain a brief overview.

Delhiites complain about many things in their city, but the <b>food</b> will satisfy even the most demanding gourmet.  Not only can you find some of the best Indian food on the subcontinent, there is also an increasing number of excellent (if often pricey) international restaurants offering cuisine from around the world.  When ordering, do remember that Delhi is about 1,000 km from the nearest ocean, so vegetarian, chicken and mutton dishes are the way to go.
Delhi has arguably the best <b>street food</b> in India.  However, do not eat unhygenic or open food. There are plenty of restaurants offering street food in a potentially more hygenic environment.
You can join local groups of foodies who go out regularly to sample and savor what new and old dishes the city has to offer. One of the most active groups is Food Enthusiasts of Delhi <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.foodenthusiastsofdelhi.com/">[50]</a>. They organize regular food walks, better known as Raids to various parts and joints in the city. Its a non-commercial group, brought together by passion and love for food. If you are looking for professionally run setups, Delhi Food Adventure <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://delhifoodadventure.com">[51]</a> runs commercial food walks exclusively for tourists. If walking around looking for good food is not your thing, have a look at some of the Delhi-centric food and eating out blogs, such as Dilli Daawat <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://dillidaawat.wordpress.com//">[52]</a>.
<b>Chaat</b><br />
If you want to eat <b>chaat</b>, the North Indian street side snack food, Delhi is the place to be. Like Spanish <i>tapas</i> or Greek <i>mezze</i>, chaat can cover a vast variety of things, but Delhi style tends to mean a deep-fried pastry shell, stuffed after cooking with potatoes, lentils or almost anything else. They're then topped with yogurt, chutneys and <i>chaat masala</i> spice mix and eaten fresh.
Some typical chaat items are paapdi chaat (<i>a mix of small round fried crispy things with yogurt and other sauces</i>), paneer tikka (<i>cubes of cottage cheese baked in a tandoor with spices</i>), pani puri or golguppa (<i>small round hollow shells filled with a potato-based filling and a spicy sweet blend of sauces</i>).
The best place to go for chaat is the <b>Bengali Market</b> (near Mandi House Metro Stn) near <b>Connaught Place</b> in the center of town. The restaurants are high quality and the food is great. There are ATMs as well. One of the best known restaurants there is <b>Nathu's</b>.  But for the really good chaat you have to make your way to Old Delhi, and particularly to <b>Ashok's</b> near Chawri Bazaar.  While connoisseurs insist that the best chaat is prepared on the street, most travellers try to find a comfortable middle ground between hygiene and authenticity.
You will find McDonalds, KFC, Subway and Pizza Hut scattered at various locations in malls and throughout the city. The Indian menu without beef and with lots of veggie options can be interesting even if you would otherwise steer clear. Rs 100 for a full serve.
One of Delhi's most popular Japanese restaurants, the fun manga style interiors and great food are a great experience.
Delhiites have eagerly adopted Thai food into their culinary pantheon, although the recipes and ingredients are often rather Indianised.
<b>Tibetan Food</b>, (<i>near Shivaji Stadium-which actually is a bus stand, Connaught Place</i>). Tibetan food, run by Tibetan refugees.
After Indian Cuisine, Chinese is Delhi's second most popular cuisine. For a long time, only Indianised Chinese was available, but high-quality options are available today.

Delhi's nightlife scene has undergone a total transformation in the last decade. There are plenty of modern, cosmopolitan joints out to separate you from your rupees.  In a desperate attempt to keep the sex ratio vaguely equitable, many lounges and clubs have <b>couples only</b> policies (that is, no single men or men-only groups), enforced with varying degrees of strictness.  While everything is theoretically to shut down by 1AM things can keep going much longer.
Indian bar food, hookah and an amazing lounge experience. The crowd that frequents these two places is young, hip and trendy.

As of July 2009, Chapter XVI, Section 377, of the Indian Penal Code, a piece of legislation in India introduced during British rule of India, used to criminalise homosexual activity, has been declared unconstitutional. At this juncture, it remains to be seen how this will impact what the ruling will have on the smattering of late night watering holes, which crop up. Due to the underground and fluid nature of these gathering places, it is not possible to list these places.

Ask your driver to take you to "Mahipalpur" near the international terminal (~200-300 Rs).  This is a street with literally dozens of hotels, side by side, stretching as far as you can see, but not of high standards, so clean and reliable.  If you don't like the first one you walk into, then just keep walking. Though cheap - but be advised that during the winter they can be a little cold and the wifi might be sketchy. At the low end, prices are maybe 1500Rs, and at the high end well the sky is the limit because there are also big luxury hotels there.
Delhi has a large number of hotels, many of them centred around the tourist/backpacker hubs.
Chandni Chowk originally meaning moonlit square or market, is one of the oldest and busiest markets in central north Delhi. Chandni Chowk is the major street in the walled city of Old Delhi, which was originally called Shah Jahanabad. The walled city which includes the Lal Qilla Red Fort of Delhi was established in 1650, by the Mughal Emperor, Shah Jahan.
This street, also referred to as <b>Main Bazaar</b>, is opposite New Delhi railway station and has many cheap hotels.  It's noisy, filthy and full of touts, but it's also cheap and central and thus very popular with budget travellers. A double room with attached bathroom is Rs 200-300.  Note that the Delhi Metro exits are on the Ajmeri Gate  side of the New Delhi Railway station, so you'll need to cross over the railway station (Platform Ticket is not needed for entering the station, see the above article on train station cons) to go to Paharganj. To do this, simply take New Delhi station exit 1, come up above ground and enter the train station. From the security check look to your right and take the stairs at the end to the overpass. This will take you over the top of all the platforms and bring you down right at the intersection of Main Bazaar Rd.
Majnu ka Tilla is a compact Tibetan settlement and the place of departure and arrival for buses to/from <a href="/en/Dharamsala" title="Dharamsala">Dharamsala</a>, the home of the Tibetan Government in Exile and the Dalai Lama. Stay here if you have an interest in Tibetan culture, politics and religion, or if you need something quieter (and just slightly more expensive) than Paharganj.
An auto-rickshaw from New Delhi train station should cost around Rs 50 (use the prepaid stand). The Vidhan Sabha metro station is also nearby and popular. From there cycle-rickshaws charge Rs 15 and take about five minutes.
Delhi's chronic lack of quality hotels has led to a mushrooming of guest houses of widely varying quality and price. The new official 'Delhi Bed and Breakfast scheme' has also contributed a range of private rooms available for bed &amp; breakfast accommodation. These rooms range from cheap dumps to classy rooms in the best neighborhoods of Delhi. These areas are a welcome respite from the dirt and touts of the main tourist areas, and thanks to Delhi's metro system, these are still within an easy reach.
<br />
At the high end of the scale, demand far outstrips supply and it's not unusual to be asked US$400 for a very ordinary room.  Getting a room at any of the hotels listed below for under US$200 will require good luck or timing.  Beware that <i>by law</i> taxes for high-end Delhi hotels are still charged <b>on the rack rate</b>, so 12.5% on a US$400 room discounted to US$200 will still cost US$50 extra.
Delhi is a hot, dusty city and the combination of the two may reduce visibility in the summer. In April through June, temperatures regularly top 40&#176;C, meaning that proper hydration is of the utmost importance. In winter there can be seasonal fog; on particularly foggy days, it can be difficult to see across the street. This is partly because of Delhi's severe air pollution problem; it is advised that travelers keep informed about the daily air quality in Delhi.  If you happen to be travelling in or out of Delhi during the winters, be aware of fog-related flight delays.
Drink only bottled water so you may avoid any water-related illness. Keep yourself covered in summers to avoid a heat stroke. Drink a lot of water, 3 litres a day, particularly in the summer. Sticking to freshly, well-cooked vegetarian food will lessen your chances on acquiring the "Delhi belly."
Many first time travellers to India find themselves falling victim to <a href="/en/Common_scams" title="Common scams">scams and touts</a>, and unfortunately Delhi has a lot of both.  Be on guard for anybody trying to help you by giving you unsolicited directions or travel advice. Do not blindly believe anything on the advice of taxi and auto drivers. They are scumbags, beware. If this is your first time to India, do not openly admit it, as this will make you more vulnerable to touts.
Delhi is also known as the rape capital of India and is an increasingly unsafe place for women.  It is very common to receive lewd remarks or even physical touching and groping.  If you are arriving into Delhi at night either stay in the airport lounge or well lit areas until daybreak. Women should avoid walking around alone in the night or hiring cabs alone. Radio taxis are a safer option. Dress conservatively. Don't be afraid to raise your voice or shout, if harassed.
Carry your cash, passport, and cards in a secure money belt, with only enough cash for a few hours at a time in your wallet or other accessible place.  Some travelers recommend carrying an expendable wallet with a few ten rupee notes in it in an obvious place such as your hip pocket as a decoy to Delhi's ubiquitous pickpockets.
Several tourist agencies have been known to swindle tourists, such as change their travel plans or  charge them extra commissions and fees. The best way to secure train tickets is by navigating through the Indian Railways Website <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://irctc.co.in">[132]</a>. Also, you should book you flight tickets online as all the airlines have online booking system. Otherwise, prepare to spend a good hour sorting through the charges that the tourist agency will charge.
The Delhi Police is a 70,000 strong force serving the capital region. Unfortunately, the quality of police officers varies dramatically throughout the force; some officers may be corrupt and unhelpful, while others are honest and helpful.
<b>For police assistance during an emergency dial 100</b>.
Police vehicles (called PCR vans) are parked on almost every major intersection.
For non-emergencies, or to report a crime, go to the police station.
Cell phone coverage in the city is excellent. There are many service providers offering a wide variety of plans. Among them are Airtel, Vodafone <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://vodafone.in">[133]</a>, Reliance <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://relianceinfo.com/Infocomm/">[134]</a>, and Tata Indicom <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://tataindicom.com/">[135]</a>. It might be a good idea to buy a cell phone and use one of those prepaid plans to get yourself connected while you are in the city.
Phone numbers in Delhi begin with 11, typically followed by eight digits. To call Delhi from outside India you will need to dial the international prefix for your country, followed by Indiaâs country code 91.

<b>Power outages</b> and <b>water shortages</b> are common Delhi, often occurring multiple times a day with summers being particularly bad.  Better accommodations have water tanks and generators to alleviate the inconvenience, but keep a flashlight handy at night and do your part by not wasting too much water.
Delhi is a major international transit hub for trains, planes and buses as well as a great connection point for domestic destinations within India. It's also a great base for exploration of the famous Hill Stations.
