<b>Guangzhou</b> or <b>Canton</b> (å¹¿å·) , the capital of <a href="/en/Guangdong" title="Guangdong">Guangdong Province</a>, is the third biggest city in China after Beijing and Shanghai with a population of more than 12 million. Founded in 214 BC, the city has been a springboard for trading, cultural exchanges, many revolutions and reforms, making it an unavoidable stopover to understand what shapes the modern China.
Mention you are traveling to Guangzhou to most northerners, you will almost expect a remark calling the place 'cultureless'. Fair or not, its isolation from the rest of 'typical China' by mountainous topography and early exposure to the outside world has resulted in its unique way of lifestyle, liberal ideas, distinctive cuisine and tremendous wealth. It is no surprise that Guangzhou is a cradle of many reforms and revolutions that changed the fate of China forever. Today Guangzhou still unveils many republic-era sights that help travelers understand modern Chinese history.
Founded in 214 BC, this capital of the richest province is always a mix of new and old. It not only boasts some of the oldest temples in China, a millenarian-old park, an imperial tomb of a southern kingdom and complete preservation of colonial villas and church on Shamian, but it also serves as a showcase of futuristic architectures and autopilot metro on Zhujiang New Town.
Despite its vibrant sight-seeing resources, travelers usually come to Guangzhou to shop and eat. Guangzhou accommodates countless huge markets specializing in almost any made-in-china products, including Chinese tea, herbs, garments, watches, electronics and toys. You will be appalled to see the real prices of those China-made products and the profit your local shops earn by selling them.
Food is the centerpiece of life and Guangzhou has the country's largest number of restaurants per capita, which is the birthplace of what you call 'Chinese food' (Cantonese food) in the west. Here you can grab the authentic taste of sweet &amp; sour pork, wonton soup and dim-sum. Few travelers can leave the city hungry.
As busy as it sounds, you can easily escape the crowd. Just head to surrounding villages, in which some of them date back to the Song Dynasty (960-1279AD). Bird watching in Nansha Wetland, a 200-hectare stopover for migrant birds from as far as Seriba, can easily make you a peaceful day.
<br />
Guangzhou is divided into ten districts. Among them, Yuexiu and Liwan, the cradle for the Cantonese culture, has been the city center since the imperial era. Tianhe, which was a farming village decades ago, has been constructed into a new business center with some biggest shopping malls and highest skyscrapers in the city.
For travelers, the most useful road is Zhongshan Road, a 9 KM long highway horizontally cutting through the downtown of Guangzhou. The highway is divided into 8 sections. From Zhongshan 6 Road (ä¸­å±±å­è·¯ï¼to Zhongshan 8 Road (ä¸­å±±å«è·¯) it covers around 80% tourist attractions and all famous restaurants. This area is well connected by Metro Line 1 from Changshou Lu (é·å£½è·¯), Chen Clan Academy (éå®¶ç¥ ), Ximenkou(è¥¿é¨å£ï¼ to Gongyuanqian (å¬å­å).

Formerly known as <b>Canton</b> in the West, the city of Guangzhou has a history dating back roughly 2,200 years.
According to historical records, the city was built in 214BC and was known as <b>Panyu</b> (çªç¦º). The name Guangzhou actually referred to the prefecture in which Panyu was located. As the city grew, the name Guangzhou was adopted for the city itself.
As a major sea port, Guangzhou's history is full of color. In 786 the city was sacked by the Persians and in 1711 the British East India Company established a trading post here. In 1757, the government designated the city as the only port allowed business transactions with foreign nations. This continued until 1842, the signing of the Treaty of Nanking, when four other ports were added. Losing the exclusive privilege pushed Guangzhou to become more industrialized later.
Guangzhou was also part of the so called "Maritime Silk Road" that linked southern China with India, South-East Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. As a result of its links with the Middle East, a mosque was established in the city in 627, and a small Muslim community continues to live in Guangzhou to this day. Additionally, the sixth patriarch of Zen Buddhism was born in Guangzhou and taught the famous Platform Sutra in the city. As a result, Guangzhou has retained a strong connection with this school of Buddhism, and the monastery where the sixth patriarch studied is considered a local treasure. The first Protestant missionary in China, Robert Morrison, entered Guangzhou in 1807. This started the spread of Christianity in the country.
In terms of climate, the best time to visit Guangzhou is between October and November. Alternatively, April and May are also good months. Guangzhou has a sub-tropical climate with humidity levels at their highest in the summer. Temperature can reach almost 40 degrees Celsius. Typhoon season is from June to September. Please note that the Canton Fair takes place annually during the Weeks from Mid-April to Early May and Mid-October to Early November, so finding accommodation at those times can be difficult and expensive.

The airport is 28 km (17 mi) north from central Guangzhou. The most convenient way into the city is by Metro Line 3. The lower level of the airport terminal leads to the Airport South Metro station. A journey to the East Railway Station, or to Tiyu Xilu Metro station (both Â¥12) takes about 50 minutes. Trains run every seven minutes, with the first train leaving the airport at 6AM and the last train from and to the airport departing at 11PM.
Taxis are also available and take about the same time as the Metro. A taxi ride to central Guangzhou will cost about Â¥120, inclusive of a Â¥15 toll fee. Taxi stations are available outside Arrival Hall Section A Gate 5 and Arrival Hall Section B Gate 6. If you arrive after midnight when the metro has stopped running, be prepared for a real long wait in line for taxis. Waiting times can start from 45 mins, not because of the lack of taxis, but because of the sheer number of arrivees. Also, do not be surprised that the queue is not really an orderly queue, which is quintessentially chinese. Some parts it's 2 people, some parts it's 4, and towards the front it can spread out to 8 in a row. People will attempt to out squeeze you to the back at every opportunity possible. You may find yourself 10 spaces behind the person who started right behind you.
Do not accept solicitations for rides to the city. Sometimes, people will stand at the arrival area and ask if you need a taxi. These are illegally operated and use unmarked vehicles, or charge you a fee, offer you a phony receipt, and then arrange a taxi that will still charge you. They usually cost a lot more than licensed taxis since many travelers do not know the cost of airport transportation.
Flying to Hong Kong is another option. From the Hong Kong International Airport, you can take cross-boundary coach to Guangzhou and other cities in Guangdong. Service providers include China Travel Service, Trans-Island Chinalink and Eternal East. Fares range from HK$220-250 one way.
Trains cover the 182 kilometers from <a href="/en/Hong_Kong" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a> in about two hours, including a stop at Dongguan. Through Trains to <b>Guangzhou East Railway Station</b> depart from Hong Kong at Hung Hom railway station in Kowloon and arrive in Guangzhou at the East station. Through train services are operated by Hong Kong MTR. <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.it3.mtr.com.hk/b2c/frmIndex.asp?strLang=Eng">[3]</a>. The one-way journey price starts from 190HKD-230HKD.
It is cheaper to take the Guangshen intercity train service (å¹¿æ·±åéåè½¦) from <a href="/en/Shenzhen" title="Shenzhen">Shenzhen</a> to Guangzhou East Railway Station. Some trips also stop at Guangzhou Railway Station. Shenzhen is right across the border from Hong Kong and thousands of people walk over the bridge between the two every day through Luohu (ç½æ¹). Tickets can be bought at the Shenzhen Rail Station in Luohu. The one-way journey price starts from Â¥80.
A project is underway to link the entire Pearl River Delta area with high speed rail network. The Guangzhouâ<a href="/en/Zhuhai" title="Zhuhai">Zhuhai</a> (near Macau), Guangzhouâ<a href="/en/Shenzhen" title="Shenzhen">Shenzhen</a> (a different railway, originated from Shenzhen North Station, than the Guangshen intercity train mentioned above) have opened in 2011, and the journey takes just 57 minutes and 35 minutes respectively. A new long distance line from Guangzhou to Beijing will open on 26 December 2012. It travels through major cities such as <a href="/en/Changsha" title="Changsha">Changsha</a>, <a href="/en/Wuhan" title="Wuhan">Wuhan</a>, <a href="/en/Zhengzhou" title="Zhengzhou">Zhengzhou</a> and <a href="/en/Shijiazhuang" title="Shijiazhuang">Shijiazhuang</a>. It takes 7h59m to 9h38m for a journey to Beijing, over 2,000 km away. One way ticket is Â¥865. Some high-speed train also go to Luoyang and Xi'an. One way trip from Guangzhou South Station to Xi'an North is between 7h40m and 9h09m, price from Â¥816. This is part of a nationwide <a href="/en/High-speed_rail_in_China" title="High-speed rail in China">high-speed</a> network that is under construction.
It is possible to take a direct train from Guangzhou to <a href="/en/Lhasa" title="Lhasa">Lhasa</a> in <a href="/en/Tibet" title="Tibet">Tibet</a>. The 4,980 km journey takes 55 hours and runs every other day from Guangzhou Station (å¹¿å·ç«). A sleeper costs Â¥869 and up. For discussion see <a href="/en/Overland_to_Tibet" title="Overland to Tibet">Overland to Tibet</a>.
Bear in mind there are now three major train stations in Guangzhou. Countless travellers have gone to the wrong station and missed their scheduled trips, so be sure of your departing station, which is specified on the ticket.
Guangzhou also has several other stations such as the North Station and West Station. There are also name variations for each of the stations. Be sure to use official names to avoid confusion.
Although some signs are available in English, staff may not understand English well enough, except at the Guangzhou-Kowloon counter. Bring a phrasebook or a Chinese friend if you're planning on traveling deeper into China.
Coach services are available to bring passengers from Hong Kong International Airport to several locations in Guangzhou. Among the destinations are recognizable landmarks like Jinan University (æ¨åå¤§å­¦) on Huangpu Avenue (é»åå¤§é), Garden Hotel (è±å­éåº) and China Hotel (ä¸­å½å¤§éåº) (see hotel section). The trip takes about 3+ hours and costs 250 HKD. There are also cross border bus terminals throughout <a href="/en/Hong_Kong" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a>. One of the Stations is at Austin Road and Canton Road near Kowloon Park. A one way ticket costs about 100 HKD.
Domestically, it is possible to hop on a bus from any corner of Guangdong province and get to Guangzhou. There are also many options from nearby provinces like <a href="/en/Guangxi" title="Guangxi">Guangxi</a>, <a href="/en/Hubei" title="Hubei">Hubei</a> and <a href="/en/Fujian" title="Fujian">Fujian</a>. Here are some of the main stations in the city:
Please note that English and Chinese names of bus stations vary from one sign to another -- coach terminal, coach station, bus terminal, bus station, passenger terminal or passenger station. Be aware that the different names may be referring to the same station.
There is a frequent ferry and hovercraft service from <a href="/en/Hong_Kong" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a>, <a href="/en/Macau" title="Macau">Macau</a>, and <a href="/en/Haikou" title="Haikou">Haikou</a> (Hainan Island) at the Zhoutouzui Ferry Pier (æ´²å¤´åç å¤´). There are boats from other mainland cities, such as <a href="/en/Xiamen" title="Xiamen">Xiamen</a>, <a href="/en/Shanghai" title="Shanghai">Shanghai</a>, and <a href="/en/Qingdao" title="Qingdao">Qingdao</a> at the Dashatou Pier (å¤§æ²å¤´ç å¤´).
New Nansha Port(åæ²æ¸¯å®¢è¿) is operating 4 lines traveling from Guangzhou to Hong Kong, Macau, and the Hong Kong International Airport. The trip takes 75 minutes to Hong Kong. <b>Note that Nansha is very far from the city center</b>, although there are various bus pickup points from the city center and Panyu. The port is 1.6km south of Humen Bridge in Nansha.
Schedule:
Nansha to Hong Kong: 08:00 - 18:00 (5 separate lines) Â¥155-250
Nansha to Macau (weekend only): Nansha â Macau 9:00 (Sat) 14:30 (Sun); Macau - Nansha 10:45 (Sat) 16:15 (Sun) Â¥180-280
Nansha to Hong Kong Airport: Nansha â HKIA 9:30; HKIA â Nansha 16:00 Â¥265-Â¥350
Guangzhou has an efficient public transportation system.  If you stay in Guangzhou for long time, purchase a multi-purpose <b>Ling Nan Tong - Yang Cheng Tong</b> (å²­åé-ç¾åé) stored value card, which can be used to pay fares in metro, bus and ferries and used for many convenience stores, public phones and vending machines.
However, to return the card at the end of the trip, you need to go Gongyuanqian (Exit J) and Tiyu Xi Exit G, and East Railway Station. (Exit HJ). It may be worth simply keeping the card as a souvenir.
Despite the sheer size of the city, walking is a great way of exploring the traditional Liwan and Yuexiu districts. The easy tour is to walk through Zhongshan 6 Road (ä¸­å±±å­è·¯, Zhongshan Liulu) which covers most tourist attractions including Liurong Temple, Guangxiao Temple, Huaisheng Mosque and many huge markets. It also has the two most popular pedestrian streets , Beijing Lu and Shang-xia-jiu for shopping mania.
To give you some sense of direction whenever you get lost, head back to Zhongshan Road and figure out where the Pearl River (Zhu Jiang) is and you will easily tell every direction. This area is also well connected by Metro Line 1 and Trolleybus 104, 107, 109 and 78(Night Bus) which is the only trackless tram system in South China.
Bicycles are promoted as low-carbon mode of transportation. Over 100 rental outlets are now available along many BRT lines and subway stations. The rental fee is by the hour and up to Â¥30 a day. One popular bike route is along the Pearl River on the Haizhu District side. Other dedicated bike lanes are slowly appearing in the city center, including Tianhe District. Yangchengtong Card is accepted in many public rental outlets.
New bikes are available in major hypermarkets from Â¥500 for a reasonable cheap single-speed to around Â¥2000-3000 for a 21-speed mountain bike. Giant and Merida are the two most common international brands. High-end bicycles are also available to affluent customers in this rich city.
Folding bikes are permitted on the subway (sometimes not on buses) and tax, but non-folders are not permitted on any form of public transport other than the cross-river ferries. Bicycles are not permitted to cross the river via the Zhujiang Tunnel or Zhujiang suspension bridge, but are permitted to go on the public ferries for Â¥1 (see below).
Opened in 1999, the ever-growing Guangzhou <b>Metro system</b><a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.gzmtr.com/en/">[4]</a> covers much of the city center. The fare ranges from Â¥2 to Â¥12. Most of the signs and announcements are in Chinese and English.
If you stay in Guangzhou for extended period, think of getting a  Yang Cheng Tong transportation cards (see details above). Card holders can get 40% off on any rides since the 16th uses in every month.
There are currently 8 lines in operation:-
<b>Line 1</b> is the most useful for tourists, horizontally cutting through the center of Guangzhou. Five major stations Huangsha, Changshuo Lu, Chen Clan's Academy, Ximenkou, Gongyuanqian cover up to 80% tourist sights.
<b>Line 2</b> runs horizontally through Guangzhou South Station and Yuexiu Park.
<b>Line 3</b> is a Y-shaped eastern Guangzhou. The 'main line' runs from Panyu Square to the Tianhe Intercity Coach Station, whilst the 'branch line' splits off at Tiyu Xilu and heads towards Airport South.
<b>Line 5</b> runs east-west from Jiaokou (Liwan District) to Wenchong (Huangpu District) and follows the inner ring road through the city. Useful for reaching Guangzhou Railway Station, the Garden Hotel and Zhujiang New Town.
<b>Line 4</b> serves Guangzhou's eastern outer suburbs and runs from Huangcun in Huangpu District down to Jinzhou in Nansha. This line is most useful for reaching the Olympic Sport Centre and the University Town.
<b>Line 8</b> was formed out of the remnants of Line 2 following it's southward extension and runs east-west through Haizhu District from Fenghuang Xincun to Wanshengwei. Useful for reaching Sun Yat-sen University and Pazhou Exhibition Centre.
<b>Zhujiang New Town APM</b> is an experimental autopilot metro system which takes you to the Canton Tower.  You need a separate 2yuan ticket to get a ride.
<b>Guangfo Line</b> is China's first intercity railway, connecting downtown Foshan with Xilang, where you can transfer to Line 1. Central Foshan can be reached in approximately 45-60 minutes from central Guangzhou. Transfers from GZ metro lines and Yangchengtong cards are accepted.
There is also a comprehensive public bus service that covers Guangzhou from end to end. By far, it is the cheapest way to move around. Bus fares are Â¥1 for the older buses and Â¥2 for the air-conditioned ones, although the older buses have been mostly retired. Information at bus stops is mostly written in Chinese, although the current stop's name is also written in either pinyin or English (not always consistent with the recorded announcement in English) and stops close to subway stations are (usually) marked with the Guangzhou Metro logo, which is handy if you are lost. On-board announcements are made in Mandarin, Cantonese and sometimes English. Exact fare or a Yang Cheng Tong card is needed when boarding. If traveling on a quiet bus, it is advisable to signal to the driver that you wish to get off when approaching your stop by pressing the red buzzer next to the exit door or by saying "xia yi zhan you xia (pinyin:xiÃ  yÄ« zhÃ n yÇu xiÃ )," meaning "I'm getting off at the next stop" or simply "you xia (æä¸, pinyin:yÇu xiÃ )."  In Cantonese "you xia" is "yau lok (æè½)."
Bus stops served by many routes are usually divided into multiple sections, each one with a different number. The stops are usually all on the same side of the road, one after another, but in some cases (such as Haizhu Square), the stops are found all over the place.
Buses are only handy for traveling within one district or for reaching suburban districts that are not served by the subway. Heavy traffic can lead to a slow, uncomfortable journey although they can be handy for a cheap but slow sightseeing tour. Trolley bus lines (Routes 101-109) are handy for exploring Liwan and Yuexiu districts.
Most bus routes run from around 6am to 10 or 11pm, after which there are night buses with the prefix 'Yeâ (å¤, night). The night route numbers are not related to the normal route numbers. The fare is usually Â¥3. Virtually all night buses stop running around 1 or 2am, and some start again around 5am. In most cases, taking a taxi at night is a better idea.
Guangzhou has over 30 commuter express bus lines (é«å³°å¿«çº¿) run mostly during peak hours from major bus and subway interchanges to congested areas and outlying districts. Fares are from Â¥1-4. There are also four special lines for University Town (å¤§å­¦åä¸çº¿). You can find these in most major stations in the city that would take you to University Town. Fares are from Â¥2-4. There are also 2 tourist bus lines (ææ¸¸ä¸çº¿) passing through many scenic spots in the city. Other special lines are: Lines to some commercial districts, shuttle buses for many different residential complexes such as Favourview Palace and Star River, and even complementary shuttle buses for some shopping center. The driver of a shuttle bus may ask for your receipts.
The Bus Rapid Transit system went into service in early 2010. It is essentially a long segregated bus lane (not an elevated busway like in Xiamen) running along the Tianhe Road and Zhongshan Avenue corridor towards the eastern suburbs. Some intersections are traversed by bridges and tunnels, which cuts journey times considerably, but other intersections have traffic lights and therefore traffic jams, and crowds can be as dense as in Metro stations but with fewer doors and a narrower standing area compared to Metro trains.
All buses that use the BRT start with a B prefix (B1, B22 etc.), though some without the "B" stop nearby. When reading a bus route (in Chinese) you can see the BRT logo above each BRT station name, like the GZ Metro logo above bus stops that are near Metro stations. The B1 stops at every BRT station, but other B routes use any number of BRT stations (sometimes just one) and use normal roads the rest of the time.
If boarding a BRT bus at a normal (non BRT) bus stop, the normal fare of Â¥2 applies, however you can transfer to other BRT routes for free, provided you transfer at a BRT stop. If boarding at a BRT stop, insert Â¥2 (coins only) into the entry turnstile to enter the platform area; no payment is required when boarding the bus, and you can board at the rear.
As with normal bus routes, there is almost no English at BRT stations, and only the current station name is in pinyin. Overall it isn't much use to tourists.
This is the most popular way for foreigners to get around, and it is very affordable. The starting charge is Â¥10 for the first 2.6 kilometres, and after that Â¥2.6 for each kilometre. No fuel surcharge is added, but a 50% surcharge is automatically added when the trip reaches 35 kilometres. A few of them also accepts Yang Cheng Tong as payment, but it is not preferred by the drivers. The taxi hotline is 96900. This comes in handy if you forget your valuables in a taxi. <b>Save your receipt because it contains the taxi's identification number.</b>
Most taxi drivers do not speak English or any other foreign languages, so have the name and address of your destination written in Chinese to show the driver. Many are from the poorer northern provinces and do not even speak Cantonese. If your destination is not well known, have a nearby landmark included in the address, e.g. "across from the Garden Hotel."
Whilst the majority of taxis are the regular VWs and Hyundais found in almost all Chinese cities, there are an increasing number of 'London taxis' on the streets of Guangzhou (which comes as no surprise as the latest generation of London black cabs are built by Geely Motors in China). They are wheelchair accessible and can carry up to 6 passengers. Many people recommend using the yellow taxis as that company only employs local Guangzhou drivers who know the city well - other taxi companies usually hire migrant workers from other provinces who may not know where they are going.
Beware of taxi driver as sometimes, in addition to going around the block one too many times, they will also try to pass counterfeit notes. Pay close attention as to what they pay when passing toll booths. Good drivers will show you the toll receipts. Only add the toll amount to what is displayed in the meter. A trip between the airport to the East Railway Station cost around Â¥120-130.
Most people find taxi drivers in Guangzhou to be honest. However, during the Canton Fair near the Pazhou Complex, it is common to see drivers violate rules, such as refusal of service and pre-negotiating a price rather than using the meter. It is also difficult to find a taxi available elsewhere in the city.
Most taxi shift changes take place between 15:00-17:00. During this time, it is hard to find a taxi as many drivers stop working by displaying the "out of service (æåæå¡)" sign before the end of the shift, unless you are going in their direction. Taxi can be also hard to come by during commuter peak hours of 19:30-09:00 and 17:00-19:00. Finding a taxi at night is usually not a problem.
While driving in Guangzhou is an option, drivers unfamiliar with the driving conditions in China's large and densely populated cities should be aware that the experience can be extremely daunting and potentially dangerous. However, it is common in Guangzhou to rent a car that comes with a driver.

Although a convenient way to navigate the city's back alleys and lanes, motorcycles are banned in the city center, and riding a motorcycle into these prohibited areas can lead to fines and possible confiscation of the bike. In addition to the central motorcycle ban, electric bicycles are banned from the city roads.

The ferries are the cheapest way of crossing the Pearl River (Zhujiang). They were very popular in the 1980s and early 90s, carrying tens of thousands of people across the river each day. Nowadays its popularity declines greatly, mostly because of the construction of many bridges along the Pearl River and the availability of other public transportation. The river narrows while going through the city center (a bit wider than the Thames in central London). It is usually faster and more convenient to use the bridges or public transport(metro, bus) to cross the river, rather than wait for the ferries. One ferry route that still remains popular is between the Huangsha Pier by the seafood market next to Shamian Island and the pier on Bai-e-tan Bar Street (Changdi Road) in Fangcun. It departs every 10 minutes from 6AM to 10PM. The fare is Â¥0.5 for a foot passenger or Â¥1 if you bring a bicycle. The fare can be paid in cash (no change given) or by using Yangchengtong Card. There are separate boarding gates for cyclists and pedestrians, and you pay at the boarding gate.
Mandarin is the universal speech but Cantonese is prevalent. Local people take the preservation of their dialect so seriously that they even marched to the government office to protest against a plan to limit the use of Cantonese in TV and radio broadcasting.
English is spoken by more people than in the rest of China (save for Beijing and Shanghai), but still not by the majority, so it is a good idea to carry your hotel's business card with you. To save yourself the hassle and agony when asking for directions, have names of your destinations clearly written down in Chinese by the hotel staff before venturing out. That said, many educated younger people will have a basic knowledge of English and staff at hotels as well as bars and restaurants widely visited by foreigners generally speak an acceptable level of English.
<b>Outskirt</b>
Note that most museums and libraries are closed on Monday.
Despite its reputation for business and busy trading, Guangzhou has many historic parks everywhere, ranging from a 1000-year-old lake garden, green mausoleum for martyrs to a vast wetland dedicating for migrant birds from Serbia and Mongolia.
If time and weather permit, walking is perhaps the best way to see the city as the back alleys, which are littered with antiquities, are not accessible by motorized vehicles. Most trades and goods categories are concentrated in a specific area or along one main street.
<b>Bicycle tours</b>
Go cycling! It may sound dangerous, but it is certainly safe and enjoyable if you stay away from the main roads and know where to go. There is a vast system of small streets and alleys, greenways, boulevards and parks that are great for cycling. You have the opportunity to explore parks, temples, outdoor markets and the quieter residential areas of Guangzhou. There is a specialist bike tour operator that offers daily guided bike tours around Guangzhou:
<b>Ride the public buses.</b> Cheap and safe. The electric trams are even cheaper at flat rate of &#165;2.  Hop on to any one of the public buses. Drivers are generally very friendly and helpful. So long as you have sufficient small change for the journey, tell the driver you are in just for a joyride. (In cantonese Yau Cheh Hor literally meaning just for the ride or just for fun. Where the journey terminates, ask anyone what buses will take you back and request the driver to let you know when to get off. So long as you sit not too far away, he (sometimes she) will tell you. Don't worry, everyone is very helpful on these buses. Being paranoid about scams and perceived crimes takes the joy out of what would otherwise be a marvellous holiday.
<b>*Daytime River "Cruise"</b> As cheap as &#165;5, you get a ride down to the last terminal at ZhongSan University and back. Just tell the ticket seller at the jetty, in front of Riverside Hostel,you just want a joyride. On your way back,you can get off on the other side of the river at the heart of the commercial district. After spending a couple of hours walking around or even dinner, it will cost you only &#165;1 to cross back to the Riverside Hostel
<b>Canton Fair</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.cantonfair.org.cn/en/index.asp">[29]</a> (China Import and Export Commodities Fair) held twice a year in Guangzhou since 1957 and is the largest trade fair in China. It has the largest assortment of products, the largest attendance, and the largest number of business deals made at the fair. Canton Fair is held in the Pazhou Complex at 380 Yuejiang Middle Road (éæ±ä¸­è·¯380å·) (<i>Metro Line 8 Xingangdong or Pazhou station</i>).
If you are going to the fair, book a hotel well in advance. Hotels tend to be booked and expensive during the Fair. Metro is the best transportation option to go to the fair ground, while many hotels provide free shuttle services.
Cantonese cuisine is well-known for its blend of color, fragrance, taste and presentation, and it is ranked among the top four in the country. In particular, <i>dim sum</i>, a delicate pastry, is famous for being simple yet delicious. Local customs, as well as a long history of contact with the West compared to other regions in China, have played a major role in the development and diversity of Cantonese cuisine. Chinese food served in Western countries is usually Cantonese food, albeit slightly adapted to Western tastes, meaning that most Western visitors from large cities will be familiar with Cantonese food to a certain extent. That being said, authentic Cantonese cuisine is also famous throughout China for another reason - Cantonese people eat <b>absolutely anything</b>, and it is often said that Cantonese people eat anything that has four legs other than a table, anything that flies other than an airplane, and anything that swims other than a submarine. In addition to that, various internal organs of animals are regularly eaten, such as the liver, kidneys, heart and even brain. This means that Cantonese cuisine is one of, if not the most adventurous in China due to their expansive use of exotic ingredients, and their extremely broad definition of what is considered edible. This is how Guangzhou earned the distinct name of "Eating in Guangzhou (é£å¨å¹¿å·)."

Tsing Tao and Zhu Jiang are the two major Chinese beer brands that are sold almost everywhere. Both are fairly standard light lagers. Carlsberg is also brewed in Guangzhou, which explains the reasonably large amount of Carlsberg taps in the bars.
The culture of tea drinking, also known as Yum Cha (é¥®è¶), runs deep in Guangzhou. After all, the city was at the center of the massive tea trade that existed between China and Europe during the 19th century.

Guangzhou was notorious for having no good hostels and terrible services for years but the city is becoming more competitive than ever. However, most hostels are usually apartment-converted which is subject to the frequent police crackdown. Better cross check if the places is still open.
Guangzhou is not as well known as Beijing or Shanghai as a hub of foreign commerce and trade - perhaps unfairly, as it's the center of manufacturing in China. Most people on the planet are no further than a few feet away from an object produced in in the Guangzhou metropolitan area at any given time. This includes the components of the screen you're reading this on.
While there may not be as many opportunities for foreigners here compared to Beijing or Shanghai, this massive city and its rapidly growing economy does offer some work for foreigners - management, translation, engineering and teaching English. There are a number of large ESL school chains, owned by foreigners, in the area who hire (mainly) North American teachers. As with any rapidly growing industry, there are many sketchy companies trying to make a buck. If you want to work as an English teacher in Guangzhou - which can be an amazing experience - make sure to verify the credentials of the school. It helps to use a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.teachaway.com">recruiter</a> that pre-screens employers for you.
Guangzhou, one of the first open port in China, is known for its liberalism and general tolerance of cultural differences. Crimes that target foreigners are rarely heard but <a href="/en/Pickpockets" title="Pickpockets">pickpockets</a> could happen in shopping areas and transportation hubs. Teahouse scams, which is a serious problem in Beijing and Shanghai, have not been reported in Guangzhou.
As the wealthiest province of China, it has attracted enormous immigrant workers both from other provinces and overseas. The local police has Arabic- and English-speaking forces to deal with the rising drug trade involved with foreigners, who are not exempted from death penalty for drug trafficking.
Traffic conditions in Guangzhou have drastically improved in recent years and rules are practiced - <i>relatively</i>. However, like everywhere else in China, cars do not yield to pedestrians and zebra crossings are for display only.
Emergency numbers are: Police: 110; Fire: 119; Medical: 120; Traffic accident: 122.
ATMs that accept foreign credit or debit cards are common in shopping malls and tourist areas. Withdrawal is available in Chinese currency only. Most banks in the city center also accept exchanges from your local currencies to &#165;. Your passport is required for this service. Some banks allow you to change back to your local currency with the original exchange memo.
Few lower end hotels and hostels have coin-operated self-service laundry room. Self-service laundromats are not available on the streets, although dry clean and laundry stores are available to clean your clothes. Normally you can drop your clothes off and pick them up the next day. One laundry chain is Tiantian (å¤©å¤©æ´è¡£), which is conveniently located in most Metro stations. There are many stores on Shamian Island that have laundry service. An average load of laundry costs about Â¥100.
In other parts of the city, there are laundry and dry clean shops sprinkled throughout neighborhoods.  An average load should cost no more than Â¥40. If you are doing sheets and blankets, they should charge no more then Â¥10 for a blanket, Â¥30 for a quilt.  Dry-cleaning a sweater is about Â¥8.
