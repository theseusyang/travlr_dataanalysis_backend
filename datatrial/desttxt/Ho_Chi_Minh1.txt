<b>Ho Chi Minh City</b> (Vietnamese: <i>ThÃ nh Phá» Há» ChÃ­ Minh</i>), commonly known as <b>Saigon</b> (Vietnamese: <i>SÃ i GÃ²n</i>) or by the abbreviations <b>HCMC</b> or <b>HCM</b>, is the largest city in <a href="/en/Vietnam" title="Vietnam">Vietnam</a> and the former capital of the Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam).
Following the fall of Saigon in 1975, <b>Saigon</b> was "officially" renamed <b>Ho Chi Minh City</b>. However the old Saigon name is still used by both Vietnamese and foreigners, especially when referring to the most central part of the city to which most tourists flock.
<b>Tan Son Nhat</b> (TÃ¢n SÆ¡n Nháº¥t) (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IATA" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:IATA">IATA</a>: <b>SGN</b> | <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICAO" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:ICAO">ICAO</a>: <b>VVTS</b>) is Vietnam's largest international airport. There are two terminals: the shiny, pleasant international terminal which took over all international flights from 2007, and the old but functional domestic terminal 200 metres away. The airport is conveniently located about eight kilometres from the heart of the city. The international terminal used to offer duty free shopping after you landed, but that ended in early 2010 â purchase such items at the airport from which you are departing to visit Vietnam. Both terminals have limited food offerings at high prices once you pass immigration on your outbound journey.
Immigration protocols at the airport are not very streamlined, and if your flight happens to arrive at the same time as another flight with many non-Vietnamese citizens, be prepared for a long wait at the visa approval desk. Staff members do not speak much English and they process visa requests in random order - many times just taking whichever request form happens to be on the top of the pile. Visa-seekers are advised to stand close to the visa approval desk and ensure that their request form is not continuously being shuffled to the bottom of the pile.
Since August 2012, it is no longer necessary for most passengers to fill in any immigration or customs declaration cards (the latter may be necessary if you are intending to stay in Vietnam for a long period, or carrying unusual goods.)
As of January 2013, you can obtain a visa upon arrival at Ho Chi Minh Airport. Yet, a visa approval letter is often mandatory to board the flight from your country. Some companies can, such as Vietnam Visa Pro, can arrange for and provide you with the approval letter. You only need to connect to their websites and to fill in their forms. They usually charge a service fee of 18 USD. You'll receive the letter upon a couple of days. Once in Ho Chi Minh International Airport, a single entry visa costs US$45, a multiple entry visa costs US$65, and a transfer visa costs US$15. It is not necessary to have exact change nor US currency, but the process is faster if you do and the exchange rate for other currencies is quite bad. Requesting a visa upon arrival is often cheaper than going to the embassy. Yet, be careful that it can take a long time in Ho Chi Minh City to get the visa and you can get your luggages only after you get you visa.
Citizens of Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland, Japan, South Korea and Russia are exempt from visa requirements if they stay in the country for 15 days or less (return/onward ticket is officially required). Citizens of Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and Laos holding valid ordinary passports are allowed to stay for not more than 30 days without visa; those of Philippines will get 21 days.
The baggage carousels are one level down from the immigration booths. You will need to have your checked-in and hand-carry luggage X-rayed before you leave the restricted area. After you clear customs, you will find currency exchange booths to your right. The currency of Vietnam is the Dong (VND). Currency exchange rates at the airport are competitive, and it is preferable to change money here than at the backpackers area in the city which tends to have less favourable touristy rates. Ask first if there's a commission fee, because this will add to the cost of changing money and remove any rate advantage that is offered. There is an ATM machine on the right side near the currency exchange booths, which you can use to withdraw cash if you have an appropriate bank card. The withdrawal fee is 20,000 dong.
The No. 152 non-air-conditioned airport bus is the cheapest and safest way for backpackers heading to Pham Ngu Lao Street from the airport (ignore taxi drivers who tell you that there are no more airport buses.) For 5,000 dong per person (as at January 2013) plus a 5,000 dong fee for bags, the bus will drop you off at the east end of the Pham Ngu Lao area (at the bus terminal on the southwest side of the Ben Thanh Market roundabout). Upon exiting the international airport terminal, turn right and you should see the bus waiting on the road opposite Burger King. There is no sign indicating where the bus stop is, but if you ask a uniformed taxi warden he or she will point it out to you. If not, walk down to the domestic terminal, which is about a three-minute walk away. Try to have exact change or you will be given coins in return. These are legal tender in Vietnam, but many places do not accept them.
Note that the bus is only available until 6:00 pm.
<i><b>Caution</b></i>: some travellers have reported that taxi scams at the airport are rife. To avoid being scammed, read the information here as well as in the "<a href="#Get_around">Get around</a>" section.
There are three options for getting a taxi from the airport to the city centre (District 1):
As of January 2013, the metered taxi fare from the airport to the city centre was about 140,000 dong, plus a toll of 10,000 dong (toll is applicable on trips both to and from the airport). When traffic is lighter (usually only between 10:00 pm and 6:00 am or on a hot Sunday afternoon), the ride to the city centre takes as little as 15 minutes. More typically, however, taxis creep along in near-standstill traffic for up to an hour.
At the domestic terminal, a company called <b>Sasco</b> has the airport taxi concession and is the only company allowed to pick up passengers directly adjacent to the building. Their cars are the first you will see by the kerb as you exit customs. However, less expensive rival taxis can usually be found usually in abundance 100 metres out in the car park. They have uniformed taxi wardens who will try to capture your business as you approach.
Taxi rates are very reasonable in Ho Chi Minh City as long as you use a reputable company and the meter is used. <b>Mai Linh</b> (mostly white with green lettering, though sometimes green or silver) â +84.8.38.38.38.38 (or 08.38.38.38.38 if dialling from a local telephone) and <b>Vinasun</b> (white with green and red lettering) â +84.8.38.27.27.27 have the largest fleets in the city and are generally honest and reliable, with meters that start automatically after the taxis have moved about five metres. At the airport, Mai Linh taxi wardens wear green shirts with green ties, and Vinasun wardens dark green shirts with maroon ties. To find the Vinasun wardens, you need to walk to the end (far left) of the taxi stand. These wardens can help to radio taxis for you and will give you a ticket that has the taxi number in case you have issues. However even the drivers of these companies may try.
Be cautious of taxis from dubious companies with names that resemble the reputable companies mentioned above. Some of these include M<b>e</b>i Linh or Mai <b>Lin</b> instead of Mai Linh, and Vina<b>met</b>, Vinas<b>o</b>n or Vinasu<b>m</b> instead of Vinasun. It has been reported that such companies charge outrageous fares to unsuspecting passengers, sometimes by using meters that run faster or by manually increasing the fare when passengers are not looking. There have also been instances of taxi drivers from such companies driving off with passengers' belongings still in the boot.
Other taxi companies with smaller fleets that have been reported as reliable include <b>Festive Taxi</b>, <b>Happy Taxi</b>, <b>Hoang Long</b> (yellow top and green sides), <b>Petro Vietnam</b> (silver and green), <b>Petrolimex</b> (white, blue and orange), <b>Savico</b> (blue), <b>Taxi Future</b> (silver with orange lettering) and <b>Vinataxi</b> (yellow). Historically, Savico and Vinataxi have been the cheapest by about 10%; while Hoang Long and Taxi Future are perhaps 10% higher than the average.
Taxis that some travellers have suggested avoiding include the following:
Budget car rental offers English-speaking drivers and new model vehicles. One trip to the city costs a fixed price of 140,000 dong.
A pick-up from the airport by a chauffeured car can be arranged online from <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.yourlocalbooking.com/en/cars/tan-son-nhat-airport-to-ho-chi-minh-city-20-18.html">Your Local Booking</a> or <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://saigonairporttransfer.com">Ho Chi Minh Airport Transfer</a>, or at booths in the airport terminal building from companies such as Saigon Tourist, Sasco and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.vietnamairporttransfer.com/localtransfer_g10-d48_saigon-airport-transfer.html">Vietnam Transfer Service</a>.
When going to the airport, specify clearly which terminal you want to go to. International flights leave from the newer international terminal (go straight). Domestic flights (to Danang, Hanoi, Nha Trang, and so on) are from domestic terminal (turn left). If you get dropped off at the wrong terminal, you'll have to dash to the correct terminal <i>via</i> a pedestrian walkway link 600 metres away. This is not recommended, especially if you're already late for boarding.
When entering the airport, taxi drivers will add an airport entry fee of 10,000 dong to your total metered fare. This is not to be confused with the airport departure tax, which should have been included in the price of your airline ticket.
If you take a bus into Ho Chi Minh City, you will end up at one of the following bus stations:
From these stations, public buses in around the city will cost you 5,000 dong per journey.
Most <b>private tour company buses</b> drop passengers off on Pham Ngu Lao just west of De Tham, providing easy access to accommodation options in the backpacker area. Of course, this means that you'll have at least 40 people shopping for the same rooms, which can be daunting as the nearby spots get snapped up. Patience will reward those who dig deeper into the tiny alleys, which have a life of their own. The French and German embassies warn of taking "Open Tour" buses.
As you hop out of the bus, taxi drivers will surround you with questions like "Where you go?". You might be confused about your location in the city and the taxi drivers will probably try to benefit from that. You'll most likely already be in Pham Ngu Lao and when you tell taxi driver to head to the same place, he'll just zigzag around a few blocks, getting easy money from you.
Several companies provide bus travel from <b>Phnom Penh</b>, Cambodia, at approximately US$12 per person. Visas to Vietnam cannot be obtained at the border, so have one organized before you arrive (see "<a href="#Cope">Cope</a>" below). Capital Tours operates a popular bus line from the Capital Guest House in Phnom Penh that takes passengers to the border. After securing visas, passengers board a partner Vietnamese bus to continue their travel to Ho Chi Minh City.
If you are travelling from HCM to Cambodia, avoid Khai nam buses. they will ask for your passport and 25 USD for a VIP visa. Price of visa is 20 USD. If you tell them you will do it yourself, the bus will drive off and you will have to take a motorbike ( obviously paying) to take you to the restaurant where they are stopped about 4 km from the border!
<b>Ga SÃ i GÃ²n</b> (Saigon Train Station; <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.saigonrailway.com.vn">http://www.saigonrailway.com.vn</a>) is on Cach Mang Thang Tam (CMT8) northwest of the city centre, and is a short taxi (50.000 VND to Pham Ngu Lao area, feb/13) or public bus ride away from the main hotel districts. An official train ticket office is located in the backpackers district at 275C Pham Ngu Lao.
There are five daily departures from <a href="/en/Hanoi" title="Hanoi">Hanoi</a> along the "Reunification line". Although several of the trains are called "express", all journeys take about 30 to 35 hours. The fastest train is <b>SE3</b> departing from Hanoi at 11:00 pm and arriving at 5:00 am two nights later. However, <b>SE5</b> departing at 3:45 pm and arriving at 4:40 am has higher-quality tourist carriages run by the private company <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.livitrans.com">Livitrans</a> attached to it. Ticket prices are from 1,008,000 â 1,547,000 dong for standard carriages and double that for the tourist ones. Trains are safe, aircon, confortable, quite fast and quite reliable.

It is an adventure to cycle around in the big city, but not that challenging as it may look like. Expect to inhalate exhaust gases, try to stay ahead or beside the swarm of bikes, be assertive, leave the left lane to the cars. If you do not have a horn, you can still scream or just smile around as you look to your destination, pretending to ignore everything which crosses your way... Not so easy to find bicycles for rent, however.  Ask travel agencies. Lac Hong on Pham Ngu Lao 305 has a few old fashion basket-holding cycles at 40.000 VND/day (feb/13). No big deal but fast enough through the jammed traffic, and a big freedom in a city without pedestrian ways. At Innoviet, 158 Bui Vien, district 1, they rent good mountain bikes at 7 US$/ day (300 US$ deposit! Jan/13)
Taxis are the most comfortable way of getting around, and very modest in price compared to other major cities in the world. Rates fluctuate over time depending on the cost of fuel, but in late 2010 with oil in the US$80s per barrel on world markets, honest Ho Chi Minh City taxis were charging in the range of 12,000 to 13,000 dong per kilometre. Taxis are numerous and it's usually not hard to flag one down anywhere in the city centre from early morning until about 1:00 am, though finding one in the rain or during workday rush hours can be difficult.
<br />
Taxi rates are not regulated by the city government, so each company sets its own fare structure which changes from time to time. You cannot choose a taxi at random and expect a standard fare; it is a <i>caveat emptor</i> market with a fringe of dishonest operators which prey on foreigners in particular. Fortunately, the market is fairly competitive and 80% of taxis are operated by reasonably honest companies with similar rates. The market of these companies is more than 90% local, so their policies are designed to win the trust of Ho Chi Minh City residents. For a list of taxi companies reported to be reliable, see "<a href="#Taxi">Taxi</a>" in the "Getting to the city centre" section above.
Dishonest taxi drivers may start driving without starting their meters, then demand a high fare or try to negotiate for a fixed price at a location where it's difficult for you to hire another cab. Therefore, make sure your taxi driver agrees to use the meter, and turns it on before you get in. (As mentioned above, some taxi companies such as Mai Linh and Vinasun have meters in their taxis that start automatically once the vehicle starts moving.)
Drivers generally speak limited English and do not speak any other foreign languages, so it's wise to write the name and address of your destination, preferably in Vietnamese, to show the taxi driver. Your hotel staff can assist. It also helps to carry one of your hotel's business cards so you can return to the hotel without too much fuss. Carry small change and bills for paying fares, since drivers are often short of change. Taxi models in service are mostly Toyota Vios sedans (up to four passengers) and Toyota Innova minivans (up to six passengers), which are assembled in Vietnam and inexpensive to buy. Fares are almost always the same regardless of car model, though anything larger than an Innova generally costs more. Some older cars might lack working air-conditioners.
Taxi drivers are likely to drive too fast when given the chance. Ho Chi Minh City has a unique traffic pattern in which cars and buses drive in the centre lanes on two-way streets, or the left lanes on one-way streets, while the outside or right lanes are reserved for motorcycles. During weekday rush hours, the car lanes often barely move for blocks on end, while the motorcycle lanes move a bit faster. Taxi drivers vary in their tendency to squeeze into the motorcycle lane and jump ahead of other cars. In theory, they can be fined for doing so. Rush-hour traffic in the city has become so bad that you might consider just planning not to go anywhere between the hours of 7:00 and 8:30 am, and 4:30 to 6:00 pm.
For trips outside of the city or for the convenience of having a private vehicle for the day, hiring a car with a driver for the day is a good option, ( the English driver is required with more fee ). Vietnam Airport Tranfer provide this services. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.vietnamairporttransfer.com/services_q44_ho-chi-minh-car-rental.html">see here</a>
<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.saigonriverexpress.com">Saigon River Express</a> Suite 2105, Me Linh Point Tower, No. 2 Ngo Duc Ke, District 1 (next to the Renaissance Riverside Hotel), â +84 128 592 0018 offers VIP speedboat tours to the Cu Chi Tunnels, the Mekong Delta and jungle canal tours around Saigon. They use new speedboats and provide a 5 star service. A sunset tour around Saigon involves exploring narrow jungle canals with a village made of bamboo and thatch as well as visiting a floating temple.
Vung Tau by Hydrofoil is a good way to see the commercial maritime areas as the boat runs through the Saigon River to the sea.  US$10 adult, US$5 child (age 6-11, under 1.4&#160;m tall), 75 min. Depart Bach Dang pier in Saigon, District 1. (100 m from the Majestic hotel) and arrive in Cáº§u ÄÃ¡ Port, Ben Cau Da, Ha Long Street, Vung Tau.
There are 3 lines (Petro Express, Greenlines, Vina Express) running this route with the same ticket prices.
Motorbike taxis (<i>xe Ã´m</i>, literally hug-vehicle) are plentiful (get used to hearing "you want moto!?" everywhere), cheap, and are generally quite safe.  As of 2007 all riders in Vietnam are now required to wear helmets, a rule that is strongly enforced. Make sure a driver supplies you with a helmet.  If he doesn't - find another one, as you'll be the one stung for the fine.
Absolutely agree on a price before you set off; short hops around town shouldn't be more than 20,000 dong, if you go between districts this increases and all the way to the airport around 70,000 dong. A rule of thumb for the price is to round up of half the cost of taxi ride for the same travel.  Drivers are generally quite friendly and will go slower upon request.  They're also not adverse to a bear hug if you're really struggling to hold on to the motorbike.  Many of the moto drivers, especially in District 1, speak some English and like many Vietnamese will repay you in a flood of smiles (and probably point out all the sights) if you make a little effort to get to know them.
You can rent your own motorbike in many places, especially around the backpacker area (Pham Ngu Lao) in District 1. 110,000 dong should get you a decent 100-110cc bike. Driving in Saigon is best left to experienced drivers. The traffic is intense and has its own rhythms and logic. However, if you're up for an adventure, it's best to keep a few things in mind: drivers with limited experience should consider renting an automatic bike (usually a bit more expensive), as at busy crossroads there is not time for worrying about how to change gears. Beware of thieves: always keep your motorbike in sight or parked with an attendant. Most restaurants have guards/parking attendants out front who will issue you a numbered tag and take care of your motorbike. Independent parking lots are scattered around the sidewalks, alleys, and basements of the city. Look for rows of neatly-parked motorbikes or signs that say <i>giu xe</i>.
If you are here during the rain season, make sure to buy ponchos or raincoats before you start. They are available for as low as 10,000 dong for one. It daily rains for around 1-2 hours between 4-8 PM during July and August in Saigon. However, the traffic doesn't stop, it just becomes more chaotic. If you are hesitant of have not driven in such conditions before, it might be prudent to park in a shade and wait
Prices range from free at some restaurants (though a small tip is common) to 10,000 dong at upscale night clubs. In all possibilities you will need to leave your passport with the guy renting you the motorbike. Even though this is safe, one should try to argue with some other ID card, or advance payment.
Riding in the big cities, especially Ho Chi Minh City, is a very different matter, and not advisable unless you are an experienced rider with a very cool head. Traffic is intense and chaotic, with a long list of unwritten rules that don't resemble traffic laws anywhere else. "Right of way" is a nearly unknown concept. Riding in HCMC is like finding yourself in the middle of a 3-D video game where anything can come at you from any direction, and you only have one life. Expats who brave the traffic at all typically have an apprenticeship of a few weeks or months riding on the back of others' motorbikes to learn the ways of the traffic, before attempting to ride themselves. Extreme caution is advised for short-term visitors.
Riding long distance in the countryside can also be harrowing depending on the route you take. Major roads between cities tend to be narrow despite being major, and full of tour buses hell-bent on speed, passing slow trucks where maybe they shouldn't have tried, and leaving not much room at the edge for motorbikes.
Two main categories of motorbike are available to rent: scooters (automatic transmission); and four-speed motorbikes, the gears of which you shift with your left foot. The ubiquitous Honda Super Cub is a common 4-speed bike that has a semi-automatic gearbox i.e. no clutch so is relatively easy to ride. Other models may be fully manual and therefore you must also operate the clutch using your left hand - this takes a lot of skill and it's all too easy to over-rev and pull a wheelie or stall the engine - if you end up with such a bike then practice releasing the clutch gently before hitting the roads! Dirt bikes are becoming popular for rent in Hanoi, other cities are not yet ready for these beasts. Rental agents tend to steer foreigners toward scooters if available, on the (plausible) assumption that they don't know how to ride motorbikes that require shifting gears. Motorcycles of 175cc and above are only legal to ride if you make a connection with a Vietnamese motorcycle club.
Most places you would want to stop at have parking attendants who will issue you a numbered tag and watch over your bike. Sometimes these parking operations are overseen by the establishment you are visiting, and sometimes they are free-lance operations set up in places where a lot of people go. You will usually see rows of bikes lined up parked. Depending on circumstance, you might park the bike yourself, or just put it in neutral and let the staff position it. In all but rare cases you keep the key. Parking is sometimes free at restaurants and cafes (look for "giu xe mien phi"). Elsewhere, fees range from 2,000 to 5,000 dong.
Traffic police in the cities pull over lots of locals (often for reasons that are hard to discern), but conventional wisdom has it that they rarely bother foreigners due to the language barrier. Obeying the traffic laws is nevertheless advisable, especially if you have failed to obtain a Vietnamese licence. Cities like Ho Chi Minh have several one way streets, and it is too easy to just steer into them unknowingly as there are limited signs warning you. BE SURE that if you break law, the police who are sneaking just at the right spot, will ask you to pull over and will fine you. They will also threaten to confiscate your bike. The quoted price for fines is negotiable, and being apologetic and friendly can get you back on road quickly, with a few dollars less in your pockets. It is less likely that they will bully or harasses you.
Helmets have also been required by law since December 2007, so if you don't have one already ask your rental agent to provide you with one.
A ride on a cyclo, which is sort of akin to a reverse tricycle with the passenger sitting in a front seat, through downtown HCMC is a great way to see the city the way the locals do.  The sights, sounds, and smells are a large part of the excitement of the city, and are best experienced from the relaxed pace of a cyclo.  A word of warning:  be careful with cameras, purses and watches while cyclo riding as these items are easily stolen by motorbike riders.
For many reasons, not least because of government attempts to restrict cyclos on busy urban streets, this form of transportation is  disappearing. At around 36,000 dong/hr and because they are so slow, they can be a good choice for taking in the city.  Be sure to bargain hard with the cyclo rider  beforehand. Some cyclo riders have been known to attempt to change the agreed price after your journey has finished, whilst another trick may include the driver visiting places which benefit his wallet.  To avoid these problems, make sure you are clear on the price and destination upon departing.
Bright green public buses serve 150 routes throughout the city. You can find maps of the bus system at the large Ben Thanh bus station across the street from Ben Thanh Market in District 1 - just go into the waiting room to the desk in the middle. The buses are cheap, safe and not too crowded.  Many are modern and comfortable, with such amenities as air conditioning, music, and even television.  Finding the right line can be a challenge if you don't speak or read Vietnamese. If you cannot find your way, ask the locals nicely, they will try their best to help. A piece of paper and marker pen may help to ease the conversation.
The buses are efficient and fast.  Most are staffed by two employees: the driver and the fare collector.  The driver keeps the bus moving while the fare collector interacts with the passengers.  Locals claim, plausibly, that buses are even faster than taxis.  The reason is that buses have an informal right of way on the streets of Ho Chi Minh City; when another vehicle sees a bus coming, that vehicle gets out of the way.  Taxis know that they are supposed to back down from confrontations with buses.  Buses are also cheaper (4,000-8,000 dong per ride, which is considerably less that $1) and safer than many of the alternatives. The biggest problem is that when you get off the bus, you become a pedestrian (see below).
For those who aren't staying in Ho Chi Minh City very long, or want to save some time the Vietnam transfer service <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.vietnamtransferservice.com">[2]</a> will take you to the famous places in Ho Chi Minh City. Price is from 15,000-75,000 dong, including the tour guide and the information in English.
Traffic is made up of a staggering number of motorbikes and, since import duty was reduced upon Vietnam's joining of the WTO, an increasing number of private cars.  However its exceptionally rare to see a motorbike of more than 150cc, and the traffic rarely gets above 20-30 km/h in central areas.
However crossing the road in Saigon can be a nightmare.  It is always scary, for some they will get used to it quite quickly.  If ever in doubt, Saigon's "Tourist Security" officers (guys in marked green uniforms) will happily help you across. A quicker way of getting across is to simply follow the lead of a local crossing the street.
However the true trick to crossing the road is to stay aware, and walk slowly and confidently.  The motorbike riders are actually exceptionally good and will simply move to avoid you - just don't make any sudden lurches forwards, backwards, or stop for that matter. Just look for a gap or seam in the traffic, and begin a slow but steady movement. If you hear a beep coming your way it's likely a motorbike rider is about to enter your personal space. Be a alert and prepared to stop putting your foot forward until he passes.
Adherence to traffic signals in Saigon is worse, and while they're not always followed, riders/drivers tend to use "best judgment". Just remember though that vehicles can <i>always</i> turn right at any time (regardless of lights). Motorbikes often drive in the wrong direction to make a short cut from point A to point B even if they are against the traffic. Crossing roads therefore maybe a challenge for westerners used to traffic laws and traffic lights.
A typical scenario played here, and in other big cities in Vietnam is motorcycles dash from everywhere. The thumb rule of crossing in the US of look to the left and at the median, look to the right does not follow. Look everywhere as you cross, in all directions - to your left, to the back at your left, to your right, to your right in front, even if you have the right of way, like 5 or 6 kamikaze ninjas against one, they will insist and even if you stare at them in the eye and raise your hand horizontally signalling them to stop. Even in sidewalks, they invade and will just appear next to you before you know. Sidewalks are not the domain of pedestrians, they are used for car and motorcycles for passing if not for parking, then whatever space left is for the pedestrian. That's the hierarchy.
The streets, sidewalks, and outdoor markets are covered by motorbikes, and not yet geared towards pedestrian traffic (although sidewalk clearing campaigns are now underway - a few areas of the centre are easy to negotiate as long as you keep your wits about you for speeding motorbikes). However walking along the edge of the road is easy enough.  Not all motorbikes behind you will generally beep at you to let you know they're there.
The traffic police occupy themselves with random roadside checks and do not bother the motorcyclists that are running red lights or driving on the sidewalks. The police recently announced a crackdown on pedestrians. This does NOT mean that they will hassle you; the most likely meaning of the crackdown is that you will be held responsible if you are involved in an accident.
But there are some open sidewalks to walk safely on and just walking around the city helps you really get a taste of it. Seeing people prepare, cook food and wash dishes, and even shave, manicure and pedicure, not to mention sleep and pee on the side of the street and just standing watching traffic go by in awe is just as entertaining as anything.
You will receive a free 'VN Trip Map - for travel and coupons' by Vietnamese women wearing the traditional <i>ao dai</i> dress as you are leaving Tan Son Nhat International Airport.  Additionally, most hotels will provide a free tourist map of District 1 although these vary in quality and tend to be advertising based.  The Sheraton have one of the best of these and will provide one if you ask at reception.  Within District 1, 'Bookazine' at #28 Dong Khoi (between Ngo Duc Ke and Ho Huan Nghiep) have larger city maps if you plan to venture beyond District 1.  The one published by Du Lich &amp; Giao Thong has a street index on the back.  Fahasa Books also carry a full range of available maps.  They have two large stores in District 1 - 185 Dong Khoi, just down from Le Thanh Ton, and 40 Nguyen Hue, just down from Mac Thi Buoi.  MySherpa Travel have also published tourist maps of central District 1 with all shops and points of interest marked. Outlets in Saigon include Gaya, Dolce Casa, Annam Fine Foods, T&amp;V Tailor, Galley Deli, and a number of two star hotels.

The best way for local route planning is to get a phone that accepts local sim cards and has GPS enabled. Vinaphone is an excellent choice. For 250000 Dong you get free minutes and internet throughout Vietnam. You can choose "navigation" and put in your planned destination and it will outline the shortest distance street by street. All you have to do is follow the little green arrow which indicates your current location. It's also good to use when in A taxi to make sure they are taking a direct route.
As with most other parts of Vietnam, the main language is <a href="/en/Vietnamese_phrasebook" title="Vietnamese phrasebook">Vietnamese</a>. The local dialect of Vietnamese is the southern dialect, which differs somewhat from the northern dialect spoken in <a href="/en/Hanoi" title="Hanoi">Hanoi</a>, though speakers of both dialects are usually able to comprehend each other. English is spoken by most of the younger well-educated upper class. Educated senior citizens are usually able to speak <a href="/en/French_phrasebook" title="French phrasebook">French</a>, though generally speaking, English is far more useful these days.
Ho Chi Minh City is also home to a sizeable ethnic Chinese community, mostly around Chinatown and many of them are bilingual in <a href="/en/Cantonese_phrasebook" title="Cantonese phrasebook">Cantonese</a> and Vietnamese. Many of them also speak Mandarin.
A few useful phrases:
<b>Hello</b>: Seen Chow\ <b>Excuse Me, Sorry</b>: Seen Loy\ <b>What is this/that?</b>: Day La Guy Yee \<b>Thank You</b>: Gam Un \<b>Very Good</b>: Rut Thoat\ <b>Bye</b>: Tham Bee-it
The Bitexco Financial Tower, located in the heart of Ho Chi Minh Cityâs business and entertainment district, is the most exciting commercial property development undertaken in Vietnam to date. It stands 262 meters high consisting of 68 floors, the lowest of which are occupied by retail stores, food outlets and the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.fvhospital.com/">FV medical clinic</a> (3rd floor), above this are offices with restricted access.
World renowned American architect Carlos Zapata, the creative mastermind behind Bitexco Financial Tower, drew inspiration for this skyscraperâs unique shape from Vietnamâs national flower, the Lotus. To the Vietnamese, the lotus is a symbol of purity, commitment and optimism.
Built at a time of unprecedented growth for the Vietnamese economy, the Bitexco Financial Tower is designed to represent the energy and aspirations of the countryâs people and is an iconic embodiment of the new and dynamic Vietnam.
Located on the 49th floor the observation deck offers sweeping 360âdegree panoramic views of the entire city and the nearby Saigon River. Facilities include a gift shop, information touch screens (in English and Vietnamese), free to use binoculars and complimentary bottled water. The 50th floor is also freely accessible via a set of stairs which lead to a cafe that serves a range of refreshments.
Head up to the 54th floor, the one with the helicopter deck (change elevators at the 50th) and ask for the "bar". Happy hour 17:00-20:00 for not too expensive drinks with free music, nuts and olives and a great view of the city.
The show ticket box is opened daily from 9AM - 6PM at the Opera House Saigon, No. 7 Cong Truong Lam Son, District 1.
Vietnamese arts and crafts, or mass-produced resin knock-offs thereof, are sold by dozens of shops around the central tourist district. The best, most expensive items can be mostly found on Dong Khoi or the immediate side streets.  The goods tend to get progressively simpler and cheaper as you move west toward Ben Than Market (though the best wood-carving shop is a stall on the back side of Ben Thanh). A few shops have authentic woven silk textiles from Sapa and the north. Lacquered paintings, plates, bowls, etc. are quite striking and unique to Vietnam. Vietnamese propaganda posters can be very impressive and offer a taste of history.
When buying keep in mind that is very useful to have <b>local currency</b> - bargaining in dollars will likely make it more difficult to get the same price, and paying with dollars instead of dong, while often possible, will leave you minus a few percent from rounding (as of 2013, $1 is widely accepted as 20,000 dong, while in fact the exchange rate for the last few years has fluctuated around 21,000). Be advised that banks and formal exchange businesses will provide you with a decent rate, especially when compared with agencies like Statravel on the main Vui Ban street who will offer much lower rates. Goldsmith shops will also change money at decent rates, though as always it is better to know the going rate than to trust in luck.
For bookshops, you can go to:
but they don't seem to trade books (no second hand).
Visiting the local electronics district is another sight, where anything and everything is repaired, and nothing wasted. Loudspeaker repairs and remakes, transformer and armature winding (by hand). Think of any part, and you may find it, including 1968 helicopter parts. It is about a 15 min ride on the #2 bus from District 1. Part of the area was recently closed for re-development, and moved slightly. Some people bring older transistor component and valve gear here to be economically repaired.
Novelty: 'FUKE' brand multimeter for about 100,000 dong. All things electronic are sourced from here, so they are going to be a lot cheaper than stores anywhere else, and some are even fixed price stores.
There are two good guide books for shoppers in Ho Chi Minh City: the Luxe city guide and the MySherpa guide which also includes a map with shops cross referenced.
You're spoiled for choice in Saigon, which offers the country's largest variety of Vietnamese and international food. Bargains are getting harder to find, however, and restaurant prices have been rising at up to 30% per year due to a combination of higher food prices, rising wages, and soaring real estate costs. Land in the city centre now sells for around US$16,000 per square meter, so even a modest-sized restaurant sits on real estate worth more than US$1 million. Authentic local food at bargain prices is one of the glories of Vietnam, but it's getting harder to find in Saigon as the city becomes ever more upscale and cosmopolitan.
The local food shows influences from French colonial times - bakeries have fresh and excellent baguettes, which they will fill with cheese (typically of the "la vache qui rit" or "laughing cow" brand), potted meat, ham, and onions, or any combination thereof, cheaply. Beef is used in various dishes - whether in any of the many variations of pho, or in a regional specialty such as "bun bo hue" or Hue beef soup. Be sure to try, aside from pho, dishes such as the above-mentioned Hue beef soup, or "banh xeo" aka. Vietnamese omelettes, consisting of a delicious filling of your choice (various options included bamboo shoots and enoki mushrooms, along with meat, prawns, or both) in a crispy outer crepe-like casing.
Local food at bargain prices is very easy  to find in Saigon. Banh Mi Thit (Pork sandwiches) can be had for 13,000-15,000 dong. Com tam, a plate of rice with grilled pork (customisable with different types of meat) and a bit of vegetables is 18,000 dong. (May 2011). If you want a wide variety of street food you need to try another district than SÃ i GÃ²n, district 5 is good or district 3 and up will get better and cheaper. As Hanoi, street food in Saigon becomes a culture cuisine of this city, you can go around by motos, see the local life and enjoy great street food.
Food stalls are scattered all over the city, but there's a fair collection in the Ben Thanh market (see <a href="#Buy">Buy</a>).  For local fast food, try the ubiquitous <i>Pho 24'</i> chain (though it can be more the twice the price of local fare). Additionally, foreign fast food franchises Lotteria and KFC have established presences in the city.
Interestingly, there isn't a single McDonald's in Ho Chi Minh City.
The setback of eating street food or food done on holes-in-the-walls in any town or city in Vietnam is unsure good hygiene. Street hawkers are not only cooks but they are also cashiers. They touch money and often flip over the bills with their fingers moistened with their saliva (added flavor to food). If a bun (baguette) is dropped in the pavement, it is still picked up to be mixed with the rest of the bunch. A hawker (hawkers are about 90% women able to carry loads on poles with their petite body) may cough or sneeze and while preparing food, cover her mouth with her bare hands then resume what she was just doing. Food may have unwanted items like hair particle or even pubic or armpit hair-like strand. Utensils may be washed from the same portable small 1-litter size ice-cream container washing basin, without detergent. Debris on spoons are just wiped off from the water on that small dish. Drinking glasses may just be dunked two or three times and ready for the next user.
On holes-in-the-wall, if there is shortage of counter space, contained food is placed on the floor. Floors are mostly wet and muddy. Utensils are washed on the floor itself. Waiters tossed used chopsticks and other dishes like bowls and if they don't get in the tub, they go right in the floor to be picked up later. Vegetables and meat parts are also cut in the floor and if they fell off, they are picked up again. Big quantities of vegetables are placed in plastic buckets and cleaned in the toilet faucet. The plastic buckets may have been used as bathing or toilet flushing pail. And when they are not used, they may be stacked together and stored in the toilet.
But street food and holes-in-the-wall food are absolutely flavorful, fascinating, exotic, ingeniously contrived, and cheap with all the elements of the nutrition pyramid and all the tastes - sweet, sour, salty, hot - well represented.
Along Pham Ngu Lao there are many budget Westernised options, and venturing a bit further into the side alleys can uncover some better choices than on the main streets, with much lesser noise and escape gases. This traveler, for instance, had an incredibly tasty bowl of pho at a small roadside establishment near Binh Tay Market in Cho Lon for 10,000 dong, much more flavorful than the stuff at Pho 24 or Pho 2000. It is useful to remember that the local Vietnamese do not necessarily have to spend 50,000 dong on a good meal, and explore accordingly.
Vietnam is the worlds second largest exporter of coffee behind Brazil, and cÃ  phÃª is very popular among the Vietnamese. It's a paradise for coffee-loving visitors. The local style is strong and sweet; key words to remember are: <i>sá»¯a</i> (sweetened condensed milk), <i>ÄÃ¡</i> (ice), and <i>nÃ³ng</i> (hot, pronounced "nowm"). CÃ  phÃª ÄÃ¡ is strong, sweet iced coffee; and cÃ  phÃª sá»¯a ÄÃ¡ is the same with condensed milk. CÃ  phÃª (sá»¯a) nÃ³ng is brewed fresh on your table brewed in a little metal apparatus placed over a cup; just lift it off when it has cooled enough to touch (and hence drink). Prices range from 10,000 to 20,000 dong for coffee in the local style.
Since ice might or might not be made with purified water, strictly cautious visitors should avoid it, though long-term residents consume ice from reputable cafes and restaurants all the time.
Espresso, cappuccino, and American-style filter coffee are now also widely available in the tourist district, usually at 2-8 times the price of the local style. You will be able to differentiate the better places if they use fresh UHT milk as opposed to condensed milk.
Saigon has plenty of places to drink, although to a certain degree Vietnamese and foreigners hang out in different places; however this is slowly changing as Westerners become more familiar with the ways of the East (and vice versa). Places with live music usually have no cover charge, but impose somewhat elevated drink prices (typically 55,000-85,000 dong for beer, spirits, and cocktails). Many places close around midnight or 1AM. Some places remain open later (<i>Go2 Bar</i> in Pham Ngu Lao - popular with backpackers/budget crowd; <i>Apocalypse Now</i> on Thi Sach St - packed with people from all walks of life (you can find anything in this place regardless of your preferences (prostitutes straight/gay, drugs or just a place to dance the night away); <i>ZanZBar</i> on Dong Du St - will appeal to the "regular" bar crowd and closing time changes daily depending on the number of people in the bar).  There are other late night clubs which cater almost exclusively to the young Vietnamese crowd.  Anywhere in the city you can find Vietnamese bottle beer places that will stay open until 3-4AM.  Several bars in Phu My Hung will stay open until 2-3AM.
Not to be missed (and surprisingly previously not mentioned on this page) are the pavement bars which get very busy with locals and travellers alike, about halfway down Bui Vien. they sell bottles of Saigon beer for 12,000 dong and draft beer for 7000,(June 2013) sit on the tiny plastic chairs and enjoy the friendly atmosphere. these are perhaps the best places to drink as a backpacker, as they are very cheap and also great places to meet people (and not just other tourists).
There are a handfull of breweries in Saigon, you can easily visit all of them in one day. Lion brewery is the most central and the brewery with three kinds of beer on tap is Hoa vien. The full and updated list can be found at beervn.com. Hoa vien serves one black and one blond beer, but also imported pilsner urquell on tap.
<br />
update: Jeram nowhere to be seen - but an excellent Rock-Combo with a just fabulous lead-singer (lady)! Mixed crowd - also many Vietnamese. Absolutely recommended! [as of 03-2012]
There are plenty of nice and reasonably priced local hotels available for tourists as well as the very expensive international chains like Sheraton and Hyatt.  Do take note (especially lonely male travelers) that most hotels do not allow you to bring back a local female companion to stay overnight. Inquire about their 'guest privileges'.  Many of the non-international chain properties (that are very nice) do allow guests.

The main backpacker hangout is <b>Pham Ngu Lao</b> in District 1, just a short walk (10-15 min) from Ben Thanh Market. The lanes and alleys in the area between Pham Ngu Lao and Bui Vien are jammed with 5-10 room mini-hotels offering prices around US$15 per room (air-con with hot shower and cable TV). They probably offer the quiest places in the city. There is no difference in price between single or double occupancy so if you are travelling alone you might want to try finding a dorm bed for around $6 (but there are not many of them around.) Keep heading southwest away from the backpacker hustle closer Ng Thai Hoc, you'll likely find that as the alleys get smaller the rooms get quieter and owners more friendly. The area swarms with touts and other nuisances - be warned that the area is not the safest, and it'd be wise not to run around carrying something like an expensive DSLR camera, thereby making yourself a potential target for thieves.
<br />
The area around <b>Ben Thanh market</b> along Le Thanh Ton and Ly Tu Trong has many reasonably priced hotels with clean rooms in the US$25-35 bracket; some provide free wifi.
The area around <i>De Tham</i> is close to the <b>Ben Thanh market</b> and is the backpacker area of the city.
Many of Saigon's historical hotels are in the hands of Saigontourist, the former state monopoly. Thanks to recent competition, service and facilities are adequate, although not quite up to modern standards; but if you want to experience a little colonial atmosphere, these remain far and away the best choices at the moment.

Luxury hotels are popping up faster than mushrooms in the monsoon rains. Expect to pay closer to US$200 for any of these unless you marry the owner's daughter.  The Caravelle, Sheraton, and Hyatt are all within site of each other near the Opera House, in the heart of the city-centre tourist district . New high quality boutique hotels are popping up around the city, an example being Villa Thao Dien in the city's most elite neighborhood.
Be aware that scam artists, reminiscent of Nigerian email scams, are operating in the streets of Ho Chi Minh.  A person will strike up a friendly conversation claiming they've either seen you at the airport or some other tourist place where they work.  Usually they'll be with other family members who will join the conversation very naturally and once they find out where you're from they'll mention that another family member is moving to a city in your country.  You will be invited over for food at their house to help console a worried grandmother or to give advise to their family member.  Once you arrive at the house however the family member is not there, or the grandmother has suddenly fallen ill and had to go to the hospital.  You'll be presented with various business opportunities, legal or not, or asked for financial support for the suddenly sick grandmother.
A common scam in Ho Chi Minh City is the so-called "Poker Scam". A well-dressed gentleman may approach you (seems to be of Filipino nationality) and strike up a conversation.  He will make a connection with your home city by telling you his sister is studying there. Eventually he will try to get you back to his house for dinner where he'll try to involve you in a poker game that you will LOSE and be coerced into paying back.  Many people have lost money this way.  Be extremely careful about who you trust.
Taxis will notoriously try to overcharge you. A taxi ride from the Airport to District one backpacker area shouldn't be more than $7 - $10.  After you come from the international terminal outside, go left to the taxi area. Only use Vinasun or Mai Linh.  Always confirm they are using a meter. Keep your luggage next to you.  You can buy a pre-paid taxi voucher to district 1 for $10 which is a bit more than the metered fare but helps you avoid confrontations.
Another common scam, is the one with the Cyclo drivers. They approach you near main tourist spots and offer you a cheap tour around the city (150,000 VDN)with the places to visit and the price shown in a plasticized paper. They show you a small notebook with some comments from other tourists recommending the deal. Once the price is supposedly agreed, they take you only to some of the places initially offered and make excuses for not taking you to the rest of the destinations. At the end of the tour they take you to a small store on a street far from where you started to have a drink with them. In this place, they give you a notebook where you have to write your experience with them recommending their services and ask you where you are staying, since they will take you back to your hotel. Once this is done, they tell you that they need the payment for the tour right there since other places may be dangerous for the handover and hand out a very different paper with ridiculously high new prices. They claim that the 150,000VDN is just the "one way price" for the tour and that for any additional hour you should add around 500,000 VDN making your total balance more than 2,000,000 VND (US$~100). If this happens, just give them the original amount you agreed upon and walk away from them or get a taxi back to your hotel; they will engage in an argument with you telling you they know where you are staying and that they want more money, but once you mention you will call the police or your Embassy the will stop. If you want to be sure that your cyclo driver is not one of these guys, ask him to take a photo with you showing his face, if he refuses, he is also engaged in this scam. They have been doing this for some years, from the dates on their tourist journal and they are mainly around the Ben Thanh Market.
Hotel scams are very common, even in the mid-range price level US$~20-70. The hotel will remind you once that you should place your valuables in the room safe or the hotel safe. Be sure that hotel staff cleaning may steal it faster than you can think since they can get into your room any time, and they will use the chance. Lock up everything that is more or less valuable. Some robberies have been known to happen in the middle of the night, while guests are sleeping. It would be wise to do your research.
Research is key in these matters as many places in HCMC are very pleasant and provide little chance of being affected by such activities.
As Vietnam expands internationally there is a growing list of places to learn the language. Here are some of the schools around HCMC to learn Vietnamese:
Free wifi access is provided at many hotels, guesthouses, restaurants and cafÃ©s. You can find open access points that don't require a password throughout the area around Pham Ngu Lao/Bui Vien and Ben Thanh Market.
If you need to fill a complaint (for example, a stolen object), you can go at a police station. For a stolen thing, you need to report to the station corresponding at the place where the theft is supposed to have happened. It can be tricky as small station will probably not have an officer with very good english. If possible, go with someone speaking vietnamese.
The central post office (next to Notre Dam) isn't just a magnificent building and tourist attraction in itself, you can actually post things there. Don't package up parcels yourself as standardised cardboard boxes must be used. This will be done for you and is included in the price. Price guide- 2kg to UK is 630,000 by air or 280,000 surface mail. 330gm 183,000 air or 105,000 surface.
