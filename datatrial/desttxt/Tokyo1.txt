Discussion on defining district borders for Tokyo is in progress. If you know the city pretty well, please share your opinion on the <a href="/en/Talk:Tokyo" title="Talk:Tokyo">talk page</a>.
<b>TÅkyÅ</b> (æ±äº¬) <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.tcvb.or.jp/en/index_en.htm">[1]</a> is the capital of <a href="/en/Japan" title="Japan">Japan</a>. At over 12 million people in the official metropolitan area alone, Tokyo is the core of the most populated urban area in the world, Greater Tokyo (which has a population of 35 million people). This huge, wealthy and fascinating metropolis brings high-tech visions of the future side by side with glimpses of old Japan, and has something for everyone.
Huge and varied in its geography, with over 2,000 square kilometers to explore, <b><a href="/en/Tokyo_(prefecture)" title="Tokyo (prefecture)">Tokyo Metropolis</a></b> (æ±äº¬é½ <i>TÅkyÅ-to</i>) spans not just the city, but rugged mountains to the west and subtropical islands to the south.  <b>This article concentrates on the 23 central wards (åº <i>ku</i>) near the bay, while the western cities and the islands are covered in a <a href="/en/Tokyo_(prefecture)" title="Tokyo (prefecture)">separate article</a>.</b>
The geography of central Tokyo is defined by the JR Yamanote Line (see <a href="#Get_around">Get around</a>).  The center of Tokyo &#8212; the former area reserved for the Shogun and his samurai &#8212; lies within the loop, while the Edo-era downtown (ä¸çº <i>shitamachi</i>) is to the north and east.  Sprawling around in all directions and blending in seamlessly are <a href="/en/Yokohama" title="Yokohama">Yokohama</a>, <a href="/en/Kawasaki" title="Kawasaki">Kawasaki</a> and <a href="/en/Chiba" title="Chiba">Chiba</a>, Tokyo's suburbs.
Over 500 years old, the city of Tokyo grew from the modest fishing village of <b>Edo</b> (æ±æ¸). The city only truly began to grow when it became the seat of the Tokugawa shogunate in 1603. While the emperor ruled in name from <a href="/en/Kyoto" title="Kyoto">Kyoto</a>, the true power was concentrated in the hands of the Tokugawa shogun in Edo. After the Meiji restoration in 1868, during which the Tokugawa family lost its influence, the emperor and the imperial family moved here from Kyoto, and the city was re-named to its current name, Tokyo. The metropolitan center of the country, Tokyo is the destination for business, education, modern culture, and government. (That's not to say that rivals such as <a href="/en/Osaka" title="Osaka">Osaka</a> won't dispute those claims.)
Tokyo is <b>vast</b>: it's best thought of not as a single city, but a constellation of cities that have grown together.  Tokyo's districts vary wildly by character, from the electronic blare of <a href="/en/Tokyo/Akihabara" title="Tokyo/Akihabara">Akihabara</a> to the Imperial gardens and shrines of <a href="/en/Tokyo/Chiyoda" title="Tokyo/Chiyoda">Chiyoda</a>, from the hyperactive youth culture mecca of <a href="/en/Tokyo/Shibuya" title="Tokyo/Shibuya">Shibuya</a> to the pottery shops and temple markets of <a href="/en/Tokyo/Asakusa" title="Tokyo/Asakusa">Asakusa</a>.  If you don't like what you see, hop on the train and head to the next station, and you will find something entirely different.
The sheer size and frenetic pace of Tokyo can intimidate the first-time visitor.  Much of the city is a jungle of concrete and wires, with a mass of neon and blaring loudspeakers.  At rush hour, crowds jostle in packed trains and masses of humanity sweep through enormous and bewilderingly complex stations.  Don't get too hung up on ticking tourist sights off your list: for most visitors, the biggest part of the Tokyo experience is just wandering around at random and absorbing the vibe, poking your head into shops selling weird and wonderful things, sampling restaurants where you can't recognize a single thing on the menu (or on your plate), and finding unexpected oases of calm in the tranquil grounds of a neighbourhood Shinto shrine. It's all perfectly safe, and the locals will go to sometimes extraordinary lengths to help you if you just ask.
The cost of living in Tokyo is not as astronomical as it once was. Deflation and market pressures have helped to make costs in Tokyo comparable to most other large cities. Visitors from <a href="/en/San_Francisco" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a>, <a href="/en/Los_Angeles" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a>, <a href="/en/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York</a>, <a href="/en/Chicago" title="Chicago">Chicago</a>, <a href="/en/London" title="London">London</a>, <a href="/en/Paris" title="Paris">Paris</a>, <a href="/en/Sydney" title="Sydney">Sydney</a>, <a href="/en/Toronto" title="Toronto">Toronto</a> and <a href="/en/Dublin" title="Dublin">Dublin</a> will not find it any more expensive than back home. Travelers should budget a similar amount of money for their stay in Tokyo as they would for any other great city in <a href="/en/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a>, <a href="/en/North_America" title="North America">North America</a> or <a href="/en/Australia" title="Australia">Australia</a>. Locals will know the bargains, but experienced cheapskates from anywhere in the world can get by with a little ingenuity.  Tokyo is one of the most popular places to live in Japan.  It is also rated the fifth most expensive city to live in, in the world.  Rent for a single's apartment could range from $US500 to $US1,000 a month.  Tokyo is so overwhelmingly crowded that apartments are usually no bigger than 175 square feet (16 square meters).
Tokyo is classified as lying in the humid subtropical climate zone and has four distinct seasons. Summers are usually hot and humid with a temperature range of about 20-30 Â°C, though it can sometimes climb into the high thirties. Winters are usually mild, with temperatures generally ranging from 0-10 Â°C, though occasional cold spells can send temperatures plummeting below zero at night. Snow is rare, but on those rare occasions (once every few years) when Tokyo is hit by a snowstorm, much of the train network grinds to a halt.  The famous cherry blossoms bloom in March-April and parks, most famously <a href="/en/Tokyo/Ueno" title="Tokyo/Ueno">Ueno</a>, fill up with blue tarps and sozzled salarymen.
<b>Luggage delivery</b><br />
Send your bags into town before you arrive&#8212;Tokyo is crowded. Lugging even a moderately sized suitcase through the subways and up stairs can be difficult, particularly during rush hour. Delivery services (<i>takkyuubin</i>) deliver luggage dependably and quickly to nearly any address.   You can send almost any shape or size of luggage, even bicycles, from and to the airport. One exception: if you have bottles of alcohol in your luggage, you'll have to carry those yourself even if the airline allowed them in your in checked baggage.
At airports and major train stations, look for a sign that says "Baggage Delivery" or something similar. The most common company is called <b>Kuroneko-Yamato</b>, which has an easy-to-spot black-on-yellow logo of a mother cat carrying her kitten.  Other companies include <b>Nittsu</b> and <b>Sagawa</b>. <b>Japan Post</b>, the national postal service, also offers luggage delivery called "Yu-Pack". Fees are based upon distance, expect to pay around &#165;2000 within the greater Tokyo area.  Usually, the delivery is performed the following day, in a specified time range.
This works the same way on departure. Most hotels and many convenience stores will take care of the pick-up for you, but you should check delivery times in advance, so that your luggage can arrive in time for your flight. <b>Most services require that you send your luggage to the airport two days prior to your departure.</b> You can pick up your luggage in the airport lobby. This makes getting to the airport a breeze. This service can also be used for intercity travel.
In Japan, all roads, rails, shipping lanes and planes lead to Tokyo.
Tokyo has two large airports: Narita for international flights, and Haneda for (mostly) domestic flights.
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<i>See also: <a href="/en/Narita" title="Narita">Narita</a></i><br />
Tokyo's main international gateway is <b><a href="/en/Narita#By_plane" title="Narita">Narita Airport</a></b> (æç°ç©ºæ¸¯) (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IATA" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:IATA">IATA</a>: <b>NRT</b>) <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.narita-airport.jp/en/">[2]</a>, located in the town of <a href="/en/Narita" title="Narita">Narita</a> nearly 70 kilometers northeast of Tokyo and covered in a <a href="/en/Narita#By_plane" title="Narita">separate article</a>. A <i>brief</i> summary of options for getting there and away:
<b>Haneda Airport</b> (ç¾½ç°ç©ºæ¸¯ <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IATA" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:IATA">IATA</a>: <b>HND</b>) <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.tokyo-airport-bldg.co.jp/english/">[3]</a>, officially known as <i>Tokyo International Airport</i>, in <a href="/en/Tokyo/Ota" title="Tokyo/Ota">Ota</a> is the busiest airport in all Asia despite a majority of flights being domestic.
Domestic Terminal 1 houses the JAL group including Skymark and Skynet, while Domestic Terminal 2 is home to ANA and affiliate Air Do.  On October 21, 2010, Haneda opened a brand new International Terminal Building along with a new runway. International flights operate into Haneda from 18 cities, with a number of these flights landing and departing during the late evening hours.  Free shuttle buses run every 6 minutes between 05:00 (5 AM)and 24:00 (12 AM), connecting the International terminal with both Domestic terminals. Also, if you are flying on American Airlines to/from JFK in New York City, you will arive in Haneda, not Narita International Airport.
The easiest and most scenic way from Haneda to the city is the <b>Tokyo Monorail</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.tokyo-monorail.co.jp/english/index.html">[4]</a> running to <a href="/en/Tokyo/Hamamatsucho" title="Tokyo/Hamamatsucho" class="mw-redirect">Hamamatsucho</a> for &#165;470, from where you can connect to almost anywhere in Tokyo on the JR Yamanote line. The monorail has a station at each of Haneda's three terminals. From the International Terminal, trains reach Hamamatsucho in as little as 14 minutes on the nonstop services; the domestic terminals are about 5 minutes farther down the line. JR East maintains a Travel Service Center for foreigners in the International Terminal (open daily 11:00 to 18:30/6:30 PM) where vouchers can be exchanged for the Japan Rail Pass and JR East Rail Pass. The Tokyo Monorail is <b>fully covered</b> with either pass.
Starting on February 1, 2011, JR East will sell a special <b>Suica</b> fare package, called <b>"Suica &amp; Monorail"</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.jreast.co.jp/e/suica-monorail/index.html">[5]</a>, exclusively to foreign visitors. The cost includes a discounted fare on the Tokyo Monorail (one-way or round-trip), &#165;1500 to use on rail travel in Tokyo or on purchases at locations that accept the Suica card, and a &#165;500 deposit. The "Suica &amp; Monorail" ticket is sold only from the JR East Service Center at the international terminal, and can be purchased using cash or credit card. It can also be recharged with additional funds, but only by paying cash. The one-way ticket is &#165;2400, and the round-trip ticket costs &#165;2700; the return trip to Haneda must be taken within 10 days.
The other alternative is the private <b>Keikyu</b> (äº¬æ¥) line, which has two train stations at Haneda: one for the International Terminal and one serving both Domestic terminals. Keikyu trains run to <a href="/en/Tokyo/Shinagawa" title="Tokyo/Shinagawa">Shinagawa</a> (15 min, &#165;400) and <a href="/en/Yokohama" title="Yokohama">Yokohama</a> (30-35 min via Airport Express [ã¨ã¢ãã¼ãæ¥è¡], &#165;440-470). Some Keikyu trains from Haneda continue on to the Toei Asakusa Line, providing one-seat rides to Nihonbashi (30-35 min, &#165;550-590) and Asakusa (40-45 min, &#165;600-640).
JR Passes are <i>not</i> valid on Keikyu Trains. If your final destination is somewhere along the <b>Tokaido Shinkansen</b> (i.e. <a href="/en/Odawara" title="Odawara">Odawara</a>, <a href="/en/Atami" title="Atami">Atami</a>, <a href="/en/Shizuoka" title="Shizuoka">Shizuoka</a>, <a href="/en/Nagoya" title="Nagoya">Nagoya</a>, <a href="/en/Kyoto" title="Kyoto">Kyoto</a>, <a href="/en/Osaka" title="Osaka">Osaka</a>) then it will be easier to take the Keikyu Line to Shinagawa to pick up the shinkansen, even if you have a Japan Rail Pass. Using the Tokyo Monorail will require you to take an additional train, the Yamanote Line, to either Tokyo station or Shinagawa.
Limousine Buses connect Haneda Airport with Narita Airport (90 minutes, &#165;3,000). Most Airport Rapid Express [ã¨ã¢ãã¼ãå¿«ç¹] trains on the Keikyu Line also run all the way to Narita Airport's terminals; these services are much cheaper than the bus (90 minutes, &#165;1,740), but buses operate more frequently. Note that the "Airport Terminal 2" station that pops up in some route search engines refers to terminal 2 at <b>Narita Airport</b>, not Haneda!
Normal metered taxis to central Tokyo will cost anywhere from &#165;4,000 to &#165;10,000, plus a 20% surcharge between 22:00 (10 
PM) and 05:00 (5 AM).  An alternative is Anzen Taxi's <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://anzentaxi.co.jp/reserve/haneda_fee.html">[6]</a> fixed fare service for &#165;6,000 (&#165;8,000 at night) to most of central Tokyo, including Shinjuku and Shibuya.
If you arrive on a <b>late flight</b> or need to catch an <b>early flight</b>, beware that there are no trains between 00:00 (12 AM) and 05:00 (5 AM) on either the monorail or the Keikyu line.  Some limousine buses do operate after midnight, but such trips incur an additional "night surcharge".
<b>Ibaraki Airport</b> (è¨åç©ºæ¸¯ <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IATA" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:IATA">IATA</a>: <b>IBR</b>) <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.ibaraki-airport.net/">[7]</a> in <a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Omitama&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Omitama (page does not exist)">Omitama</a>, <a href="/en/Ibaraki" title="Ibaraki">Ibaraki</a>, some 85 km north of Tokyo, is an upstart aimed squarely at low-cost carriers.  As of 2010, services are limited to flights from <a href="/en/Kobe" title="Kobe">Kobe</a>, <a href="/en/Seoul" title="Seoul">Seoul</a> and <a href="/en/Shanghai" title="Shanghai">Shanghai</a>, but the 1.5-hour bus ride to/from Tokyo Station is only &#165;500 for flight passengers. (pre-booked)
<b>ChÅfu Airfield</b> (èª¿å¸é£è¡å ´ <i>ChÅfu hikÅjÅ</i>) serves only some turboprop flights to the <a href="/en/Izu_Islands" title="Izu Islands">Izu Islands</a> south of Tokyo.  The nearest railway station is Nishi-ChÅfu on the KeiÅ Line, a 15-minute walk away.  Alternatively, you can take a bus from <a href="/en/Chofu" title="Chofu">Chofu</a> or <a href="/en/Mitaka" title="Mitaka">Mitaka</a> stations.
Tokyo is the nerve centre of railways in Japan, highspeed <i>Shinkansen</i> services arrives at <b>Tokyo Station</b> (æ±äº¬é§ <i>TÅkyÅ-eki</i>) which is located in the <a href="/en/Tokyo/Chiyoda" title="Tokyo/Chiyoda">Chiyoda</a> ward. For all trains on the northern route, you can get off at <a href="/en/Tokyo/Ueno" title="Tokyo/Ueno">Ueno</a>, while trains on the western route calls at <a href="/en/Tokyo/Shinagawa" title="Tokyo/Shinagawa">Shinagawa</a>. Most non-Shinkansen services usually stops at <a href="/en/Tokyo/Shibuya" title="Tokyo/Shibuya">Shibuya</a> and <a href="/en/Tokyo/Shinjuku" title="Tokyo/Shinjuku">Shinjuku</a> stations as well. Ueno and <a href="/en/Tokyo/Ikebukuro" title="Tokyo/Ikebukuro">Ikebukuro</a> stations connect you to the northern suburbs and neighboring prefectures.
On the western route there are departures every 10-15 minutes from <a href="/en/Kyoto" title="Kyoto">Kyoto</a> and <a href="/en/Osaka" title="Osaka">Osaka</a> with two types of shinkansen trains, <i>Nozomi</i> is the fastest cutting the journey time down to 2:20 hours while the slightly slower <i>Hikari</i> trains adds an extra twenty minutes.
The northen route connects with <a href="/en/Aomori" title="Aomori">Aomori</a>, <a href="/en/Fukushima" title="Fukushima">Fukushima</a> and <a href="/en/Sendai" title="Sendai">Sendai</a>, the fastest services are with the <i>Hayabusa</i> and <i>Hayate</i> trains.
Altough Japan is dominated by fast shinkansen trains there are still a few sleeper trains left. <i>Sunrise Izumo</i> (ãµã³ã©ã¤ãºåºé²) runs daily to Tokyo from <a href="/en/Izumo" title="Izumo">Izumo</a> while <i>Sunrise Seto</i> (ãµã³ã©ã¤ãºç¬æ¸) connects with <a href="/en/Takamatsu" title="Takamatsu">Takamatsu</a>, the largest city on the <a href="/en/Shikoku" title="Shikoku">Shikoku</a> island. Also, the luxurious <i>Cassiopeia</i> (ã«ã·ãªãã¢) overnight train offers an direct route from the northen city of <a href="/en/Sapporo" title="Sapporo">Sapporo</a> three times a week. Fares starts at Â¥27,000 with a journey time of 16Â½ hours. For those on a smaller budget, the <i>Hokutosei</i> (åææ) leaves daily and has a more reasonable price of just over Â¥9,000. Notice that the both trains from Sapporo arrives in Ueno.
While you can drive into the city, it's really not recommended as the city can be congested, signs may be confusing and parking fees are astronomical.
Hitchhiking into Tokyo is pretty easy, but hitchhiking out is considerably more difficult.  It's definitely possible for determined cheapskates though, see <a href="/en/Hitchhiking_in_Japan" title="Hitchhiking in Japan">Hitchhiking in Japan</a> for a detailed list of tested escape routes from the city.
Highway bus services link Tokyo to other cities, resort areas and the surrounding prefectures. There are JR and private bus companies. Bus service may be cheaper, but the train is probably more convenient. If you have a JR pass, then you should generally stick with the trains.
Long-distance buses use a number of terminals scattered throughout the city, but the main JR depot is at Tokyo Station's <b>Yaesu-minamiguchi</b> (å«éæ´²åå£) exit, while Keio and some other private companies use the <b>Shinjuku Highway Bus Terminal</b> (æ°å®¿é«éãã¹ã¿ã¼ããã«), opposite Yodobashi Camera near the West Exit.
One of the great ports of the world, Tokyo also has domestic ferry services to other points in Japan. However, none of the regular international ferries to Japan call at Tokyo.
The main long-distance ferry terminal is <b>Ariake Ferry Terminal</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.tptc.or.jp/eng/ferry.htm">[11]</a>, located on an artificial island adjacent to <a href="/en/Tokyo/Odaiba" title="Tokyo/Odaiba">Odaiba</a> in Tokyo Bay.  The nearest station is Kokusai-Tenjijo-Seimon on the Yurikamome line, but it's still a bit of a hike.  You can also take a direct bus from Shin-Kiba station on the Metro Yurakucho line. The main services from this terminal are:
Ferries to the <a href="/en/Izu_Islands" title="Izu Islands">Izu</a> and <a href="/en/Ogasawara_Islands" title="Ogasawara Islands">Ogasawara Islands</a> leave from <b>Takeshiba Terminal</b> (ç«¹èå®¢è¹ã¿ã¼ããã«), adjacent to Takeshiba station on the Yurikamome line.  Cruise liners tend to use the <b>Harumi Terminal</b> (æ´æµ·å®¢è¹ã¿ã¼ããã«), best accessible on bus é½05 (To-05) from Tokyo station Marunouchi South Exit or æ±12(Tou-12) from Tokyo station Yaesu exit.  International ferries and cargo ferries that also take passengers can leave from other terminals too, enquire with your shipping company.
Tokyo has one of the most extensive mass transit systems in the world. It is clean, safe and efficient - and confusing. The confusion arises from the fact that several distinct railway systems operate within Tokyo - the JR East network, the two subway networks, and various private lines - and different route maps show different systems. Avoid rush hours if possible; trains get overcrowded very easily.
The defining rail line in Tokyo is the JR <b>Yamanote Line</b> (å±±æç·), which runs in a loop around central Tokyo; being inside the Yamanote loop is synonymous with being in the core of Tokyo. Almost all inter-regional JR lines and private lines start at a station on the Yamanote.  JR's lines are color-coded, and the Yamanote is green.  The <b>JR Chuo</b> (ä¸­å¤®ç·, orange) and <b>Sobu</b> (ç·æ­¦ç·, yellow) lines run side-by-side, bisecting the Yamanote loop from <a href="/en/Tokyo/Shinjuku" title="Tokyo/Shinjuku"> Shinjuku</a> on the west to <a href="/en/Tokyo_(station)" title="Tokyo (station)" class="mw-redirect"> Tokyo</a> on the east.  JR's other commuter lines, the Saikyo and Keihin-Tohoku, run off the rim of the Yamanote loop to the north and south.  JR East has a good English information line, 050-2016-1603 or 03-3423-0111.
Tokyo has an extensive <b>subway</b> network with frequent trains, and these are primarily useful for getting around within the Yamanote loop. The <b>Tokyo Metro</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.tokyometro.jp/e/index.html">[12]</a> runs nine lines: Ginza, Marunouchi, Hibiya, Tozai, Chiyoda, Yurakucho, Hanzomon, Namboku and Fukutoshin lines.  <b>Toei</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.kotsu.metro.tokyo.jp/english/index.html">[13]</a> operates the Asakusa, Mita, Shinjuku, and Oedo lines. While the JR Yamanote Line is not a subway line, due to its importance as a major transportation artery in downtown Tokyo, it is usually featured on subway maps. In addition, there is a largely underground  Rinkai Line, a private line which is operated by Tokyo Waterfront Area Rapid Transit <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.twr.co.jp">[14]</a> (web-site only in Japanese) or <b>TWR</b>, that passes through the island of <a href="/en/Odaiba" title="Odaiba" class="mw-redirect">Odaiba</a>.
Announcements and signs are usually bilingual in Japanese and English, though in some areas frequented by tourists, signs in Korean and Chinese can also be seen.
A number of <b>private commuter lines</b> radiate from the Yamanote loop out into the outlying wards and suburbs, and almost all connect through directly to subway lines within the loop. The private lines are useful for day trips outside the city, and are slightly cheaper than JR. Among these, the most important to visitors is arguably the <b>Yurikamome</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.yurikamome.co.jp/en/">[15]</a> which offers great views on the way to the island of <a href="/en/Odaiba" title="Odaiba" class="mw-redirect">Odaiba</a>.
Most tickets and passes are sold from automated vending machines. Almost all vending machines now have an "English" mode. Keep in mind that <b>JR trains are free with a Japan Rail Pass</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.japanrailpass.net/">[16]</a>.
<b>Prepaid fare cards</b> are convenient and highly recommended because they allow you to ride trains without having to read the sometimes Japanese-only fare maps to determine your fare. There are two brands of prepaid fare cards, JR East's <b>Suica</b>, and <b>PASMO</b>, offered by private (non-JR) lines. Functionally they are completely interchangeable and can be used on just about every subway, train and bus line in Tokyo (with the noted exception of JR's Shinkansen and limited express trains).
The fare cards are rechargeable "smart cards": you simply tap your card on the touch pad next to the turnstile as you go in, and do the same when going through to exit. There is an initial &#165;500 deposit that you must pay when purchasing a fare card, but up to &#165;20,000 in value can be stored on each card.
The older <b>Passnet</b> cards are not accepted anymore. If you still own some of these, you can exchange them for a <b>PASMO</b> or <b>Suica</b> card.
There are also some special tickets that allow unlimited travel, but most are unlikely to be useful to tourists unless you're planning to spend half your day on the train.
<b>Who is making announcements in English?</b><br />
In Tokyo, whichever train you take--namely, JR East, Tokyo Metro, Toei Subway, Tobu Railway, Seibu Railway, Odakyu Electric Railway, and Keisei Electric Railway--you will hear English announcements in a similar voice.
Actually, they are all announced by the same voice actor, Christelle Ciari.<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www3.plala.or.jp/christelle/">[17]</a>
In a Japanese interview she said, "Most railway companies I worked for did not give me any instruction on how to pronounce the station names in English. So I decided to read them in the original Japanese accent because I personally thought it was more natural and easier to comprehend for non-native speakers of English. The only exception was JR East, which instructed me to announce the station names in an American accent."
Therefore, you will hear "Shibuya" on Tokyo Metro while you will hear "Sheebooyah" on JR trains.
If you're paying <i>a la carte</i>, subway and train fares are based on distance, ranging from &#165;110 to &#165;310 for hops within central Tokyo. As a general rule of thumb, Tokyo Metro lines are cheapest, Toei lines are most expensive, and JR lines fall somewhere in the middle (but are usually cheaper than Metro for short trips, i.e. no more than 4 stations). Many of the private lines interoperate with the subways, which can occasionally make a single ride seem unreasonably expensive as you are in essence transferring to another line and fare system, even though you're still on the same train.  E.g. changing between Metro subway line and Tokyu private line amounts to paying the sum of each fare: minimum fare Metro &#165;160 + minimum fare Tokyu &#165;120 = &#165;280.  In addition, several patterns of transfer are listed as "Transfer Discount", and the most famous one is &#165;70 discount, that applies to a transfer between Tokyo Metro and Toei subway lines. When using Suica or PASMO, you can get all transfer discounts automatically. At some transfer stations, you may need to pass through a special transfer gate (both for paper tickets and PASMO/Suica) which is coloured orange - passing through the regular blue gate will not get you your transfer discount and if you have a paper ticket, you won't get it back. At some transfer points (e.g. Asakusa station) you may actually need to transfer on street level as the two stations (Metro Ginza Line and Toei Asakusa Line) are not physically connected and are about one block apart.
It pays to check your route beforehand. The <b>Tokyo Transfer Guide</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.tokyo-subway.net/english/">[18]</a> by the Tokyo Metro and Toei subway companies, is an online service that allows you to plan subway and train travel from point A to point B, based on time, cost, and transfers.  This guide provides information for Tokyo only, and there are other sites which additionally cover the whole country, see the <a href="/en/Japan#Get_around" title="Japan"> Japan</a> page.  Some major stations have terminals providing information similar to the Tokyo Transfer Guide.
If you can't figure out how much it is to the destination, you can buy the cheapest ticket and pay the difference at the Fare Adjustment Machine (<i>norikoshi</i>) at the end. Most vending machines will let you buy a single ticket that covers a transfer between JR, subway and private lines, all the way to your destination, but working out how to do this may be a challenge if you are not familiar with the system.  When transferring between systems, whether paying with tickets or smart cards, use the <b>orange transfer gates</b> to exit.  Otherwise, you'll be charged full fare for both separate parts of your trip, instead of the cheaper transfer fare.
Most train lines in Tokyo run from around 05:00 to 01:00. During peak hours they run about once every three minutes; even during off-peak hours it's less than ten minutes between trains. The only night when regular passenger services run overnight is for the New Year's Holiday on select lines.

Taxis are very pricey, but may be a value for groups of three or more. Also, if you miss your last train, you may not have another choice.
Fares generally start at &#165;710 for the first two kilometers and can add up rapidly. A 20% night surcharge is tacked on from 22:00-05:00. As a rule of thumb, a daytime trip across the city from Tokyo station to Shinjuku station will cost approximately &#165;3000, while a daytime trip from Tokyo station to Haneda Airport costs around &#165;6200. These examples are based on standard routing and traffic conditions, so your actual fare may vary in relation to the estimated fare.
Do not count on your taxi driver speaking English--or knowing more than the best-known locations, though most taxis have GPS "car navi" systems installed.  The best and easiest thing to do is to prepare a map marked with where you want to go, and point it out on the map to the taxi driver. If you are staying at a hotel, they will provide a map. If possible, get a business card, or print out the address in Japanese of any specific places you wish to go.  However, because in Japan streets are often unmarked, if the taxi driver does not have GPS he may not be able to do more than take you to the general vicinity of where you want to go. Also, note that taxis can get caught in traffic jams.   No tips are expected or given.
Taxi rear left passenger doors are operated by the driver and open and close automatically. Don't open or close them yourself.
Tokyo is a gigantic warren of narrow streets with no names, with sometimes slow-moving traffic and relatively limited and expensive parking. In this city with such an excellent mass transit system, you would need a good reason to want to drive around instead, unless you already have some familiarity with the city and its surroundings.  While renting a car does make sense in Japan in some contexts (e.g. travelling between cities, visiting smaller towns or a rural onsen resort), in general it is neither convenient nor economical to rent a car to get around metro Tokyo.  Taxis are much more convenient if your budget allows it; walking or public transportation is much less expensive and given the difficulties of navigation and finding parking in popular areas, probably easier too.
If you do decide to plunge in and drive around by car, the main expressway serving Tokyo is the Shuto Expressway, abbreviated to <b>Shutoko</b> (é¦é½é«) <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.shutoko.jp/english/">[19]</a>. The C1 Loop Line forms a circle around central Tokyo, similar in fashion to how the Yamanote Line does it by rail. But whereas the Yamanote Line charges &#165;130-250 for a single trip, driving a car onto the Shutoko in Tokyo entitles you to pay either in cash a flat entry fee of <b>&#165;900</b> every time you enter the system, or, if your car is equipped with the electronic toll system (ETC), a flexible toll between  (&#165;500 and &#165;900) depending on the distance travelled. When driving around, both on Shuto and on the regular streets, try to avoid the rush hour (with traffic moving into the centre in the morning, and out towards suburbs in the evening). Check with the car rental agency whether English-language navigation system is available, as it will make a huge difference, and you will be able to use your car to outperform the public transportation on many occasions.
Driving on the Tokyo Expressway at night can be a pleasant and beautiful experience as you whiz through and around the Tokyo nightlife. When driving at night you should <b>exercise caution</b> and obey speed limits: <b>Street racing</b> over the Shutoko at night became popular in the 80's and 90's and still happens today, albeit on a less frequent basis. Street racers often concentrate their driving on the C1 Loop Line and the Bayshore (more popularly known as the Wangan) Line. "Competitors" sometimes hang out at parking and service areas on the Shutoko, especially the large Daikoku Parking Area at the intersection of the Bayshore Line and the K5 Daikoku Line in <a href="/en/Yokohama" title="Yokohama">Yokohama</a>.
The few areas within Tokyo that aren't easily accessible by train are served by various bus companies. Buses operating within 23 wards of Tokyo have a fixed fare regardless of distance (&#165;200 on Toei buses <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.kotsu.metro.tokyo.jp/english/bus_op.html">[20]</a> and &#165;210 on other private bus companies), which is paid upon boarding from the front door. The fares are not transferable; however most buses do accept <b>Suica</b> or <b>PASMO</b> fare cards (see above). If you use a "Suica" or "PASMO" card to board a Toei Bus, you will receive a &#165;100 discount on your next Toei Bus ride as long as it is within 90 minutes of the previous ride. The fare can also be payed in hard currency of practically any denomination, which can also be used to charge your electronic fare card if you tell the driver you wish to do so. Compared to the trains, the buses run much less frequently, carry fewer passengers, and are much slower. This makes them amenable to the elderly residents of Tokyo, but rather inconvenient for travelers, who will also have to deal with lack of information in English and sometimes very well hidden bus stops.
The bus routes are named by a kanji based on a destination they serve and a number, e.g. "æ¸64" for the route between Shibuya (æ¸è°·) and Nakano. The routes can be fairly complicated and are often not listed in detail at the bus stops; signs on the buses themselves often list only two or three main stops in addition to the origin and destination. Finding a bus going towards a main terminal like Shibuya or Shinjuku is therefore pretty easy, the other way around may be more difficult. You may find several different stops by different companies within a few meters, all sharing the same name; sometimes those are full-fledged waiting areas and sometimes only a signpost at a street corner. Inside the bus the next stop is usually announced several times, sometimes by a taped voice and sometimes by a mumbling driver; recently taped announcements in English are used on some lines, but are still rare. In addition the stop is displayed on an electronic display, but rarely in latin writing. Some stops may have similar names, you should make sure you know the exact name of the stop you want to get off at. Drivers are usually very helpful, though aren't typically used to tourists and may be rather busy dealing with fares, passengers and traffic. Nevertheless, north-south routes are useful in the western side of the city since train lines (Odakyu, Keio, Chuo, and Seibu) tend to run east-west. Google Maps <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.google.com/maps?ie=UTF8&amp;ll=36.664739,136.71386&amp;spn=20.943012,19.6875&amp;dirflg=r">[21]</a> has begun adding bus transit information and is possibly the easiest way of planning a trip by bus.
The Tokyo Cruise Ship Company operates a series of <b>Water Bus</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.suijobus.co.jp/english/">[22]</a> ferries along the Sumida River and in Tokyo Bay, connecting <a href="/en/Tokyo/Asakusa" title="Tokyo/Asakusa">Asakusa</a>, <a href="/en/Tokyo/Hinode" title="Tokyo/Hinode" class="mw-redirect">Hinode</a>, <a href="/en/Tokyo/Harumi" title="Tokyo/Harumi" class="mw-redirect">Harumi</a> and <a href="/en/Tokyo/Odaiba" title="Tokyo/Odaiba">Odaiba</a>. The ferries feature a recorded tour announced in English as well as Japanese and a trip on one makes for a relaxing, leisurely way to see the waterfront areas of Tokyo. Of particular note is the super-futuristic Himiko ferry <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.suijobus.co.jp/english/cruise_e/index_asa_line.html">[23]</a> designed by anime and manga creator Leiji Matsumoto , which runs on the Asakusa-Odaiba Direct Line. You might want to arrive well before the departure time just in case tickets on the Himiko sell out!
Bicycles are very commonly used for local transport, but amenities like bicycle lanes are rare, drivers pay little heed to bikes and traffic can be very heavy on weekdays, so if you use a bicycle, do not be afraid to cycle on the sidewalk (everyone does). Keep in mind, however, that parts of Tokyo are surprisingly hilly, and it's a sweaty job pedaling around in the summer heat.  Central Tokyo can still be covered fairly comfortably by bike on the weekends.  Tokyo Great Cycling Tour <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.tokyocycling.jp">[24]</a> offers a one day guided tour for biking around major tourist spots in Tokyo, like Marunouchi, Nihonbashi, Tsukiji, Odaiba, Tokyo tower, Imperial palace and so on.
Renting a bike is possible from some youth hostels, particularly around Asakusa, although it's not common. However, buying a simple single-speed roadster is fairly cheap, and comes complete with a built-in bicyle wheel lock system (this is what most Tokyoites use). An imported multiple-geared bike will be much more expensive so get a good lock, as bike theft is a common threat, although the problem is nowhere near as serious as in other countries.
In this large city with such an efficient public transportation system, walking to get from point A to point B would seem a bit stupid at first glance. However, as the city is extremely safe even at night, walking in Tokyo can be a very pleasant experience. In some areas, walking can be much shorter than taking the subway and walking the transit (the whole Akasaka/Nagatacho/Roppongi area in the center is for instance very easily covered on foot). If you have the time, Shinjuku to Shibuya via Omotesando takes roughly one hour, Tokyo Station to Shinjuku would be a  half a day walk, and the whole Yamanote line Grand Tour takes a long day.
It's possible for English speakers to navigate their way around Tokyo without speaking any Japanese. Signs at subway and train stations include the station names in <i>romaji</i> (Romanized characters), and larger stations often have signs in Chinese and Korean as well. Though most people under the age of 40 have learned English in school, proficiency is generally poor, and most locals would not know more than a few basic words and phrases. Some restaurants may have English menus, but it does not necessarily mean that the staff will speak much English. Reading and writing comes much better though, and many people can understand a great deal of written English without actually knowing how to speak it. That being said, staff at the main hotels and tourist attractions generally speak an acceptable level of English. While it is possible to get by with only English, it will nevertheless make your trip much smoother if you can learn some basic <a href="/en/Japanese_phrasebook" title="Japanese phrasebook">Japanese</a>.  It should also be noted that the Japanese are much more willing to speak English if you make some attempt to speak Japanese.  At the very least learn to say common greetings and "which train to...".
Overpronouncing the Y in names like Tokyo make it difficult for the native Japanese speaker to understand.  It's not silent, but it's not a separate syllable either. "Toh-qyo"
Tokyo has a vast array of sights, but the first items on the agenda of most visitors are the temples of <a href="/en/Tokyo/Asakusa" title="Tokyo/Asakusa"> Asakusa</a>, the gardens of the <b>Imperial Palace</b> (in <a href="/en/Tokyo/Chiyoda" title="Tokyo/Chiyoda">Chiyoda</a>) and the <b>Meiji Shrine</b> (ææ²»ç¥å®®, in <a href="/en/Tokyo/Harajuku" title="Tokyo/Harajuku">Harajuku</a>).
Tokyo has many commercial centres for shopping, eating and simply wandering around for experiencing the modern Japanese urban phenomenon.  Each of these areas have unique characteristics, such as dazzling <a href="/en/Shinjuku" title="Shinjuku" class="mw-redirect">Shinjuku</a>, youthful <a href="/en/Shibuya" title="Shibuya" class="mw-redirect">Shibuya</a> and upmarket <a href="/en/Ginza" title="Ginza" class="mw-redirect">Ginza</a>. These areas are bustling throughout the day, but they really come into life in the evenings.
If you're looking for a viewing platform, the <b>Tokyo Tower</b> is the best known and offers an impressive view, even if it's rather overpriced. The highest spot in Tokyo is the <b>Tokyo Metropolitan Government</b>  building (in effect, Tokyo's City Hall) in <a href="/en/Tokyo/Shinjuku" title="Tokyo/Shinjuku">Shinjuku</a>. Its twin towers have viewing platforms that are absolutely free, and offer a great view over Tokyo and beyond. However, the best option would probably be from the <b>World Trade Center Building</b> (10:00-20:00, or 21:00 in July and August, Â¥620) at JR Hamamatsucho station which, although not as high, offers stunning views of Tokyo Tower and the waterfront due to its excellent location, especially at dusk. A recent addition to the viewing platforms around Tokyo is Tokyo City View in <b>Roppongi Hills</b>, <a href="/en/Tokyo/Roppongi" title="Tokyo/Roppongi"> Roppongi</a> -- admission is a steep Â¥1500, but includes admission to the <b>Mori Art Museum</b>.  Another good option, if you don't mind traffic noise and smell, is the <b>Rainbow Bridge</b> at <a href="/en/Tokyo/Odaiba" title="Tokyo/Odaiba">Odaiba</a>, whose pedestrian walkways are free. The night-time view across Tokyo Bay is impressive but the walkways close at 20:00. Also, on a clear day, the Bunkyo Civic Center (next to the Tokyo Dome) offers an iconic view of Shinjuku against Mt. Fuji (especially great at sunset), also free.
The city is dotted with museums, large and small, which center on every possible interest from pens to antique clocks to traditional and modern arts.  Many of the largest museums are clustered around <a href="/en/Tokyo/Ueno" title="Tokyo/Ueno"> Ueno</a>.  At Â¥500 to Â¥1,000 or more, entrance fees can add up quickly.
Riding <b><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://skybus.jp/explains/index/00033">Sky Bus Tokyo</a></b>, an open-top double-decker operated by Hinomaru Limousine (every hour between 10:00 and 18:00), is a good option to take a quick tour around the city center. The 45 minutes bus ride on the "T-01 course" will take you around the Imperial Palace via Ginza and Marunouchi district, showing the highlight of Tokyo's shopping and business center. The fare is Â¥1,500 for adults of 12 years old and over, and Â¥700 for children between 4 and 11 years old. You can borrow a multi-language voice guide system free of charge upon purchasing a ticket, subject to stock availability. Four other bus courses are offered, including a night trip to Odaiba, but those trips are conducted in Japanese with no foreign language guidance.
The curious can study traditional culture such as <b>tea ceremony</b>, <b>calligraphy</b>, or <b>martial arts</b> such as Karate, Judo, Aikido and Kendo. There are also many language schools to help you work on your Japanese. Several universities in Tokyo cater to international students at the undergraduate or graduate level.
<a href="/en/Teaching_English" title="Teaching English">Teaching English</a> (or to a lesser extent, other foreign languages) is still the easiest way to work in Tokyo, but the city also offers more work options than other areas of the country: everything from restaurant work to IT. Certain nationalities are eligible for working holiday visas: for others, work permits can be very hard to come by without a job offer from a Japanese company. Consult your local Japanese consulate/embassy as far in advance as possible.
If it is for sale anywhere in the world, you can probably buy it in Tokyo. Tokyo is one of the fashion and cosmetic centers in the Eastern world. Items to look for include electronics, funky fashions, antique furniture and kimono, as well as specialty items like Hello Kitty and Pokemon goods, anime and comics and their associated paraphernalia. Tokyo has some of the largest electronic industries in the world, such as Sony, Panasonic, and Toshiba etc.
Cash payment is the norm. Most Japanese ATMs do <i>not</i> accept foreign cards, but post office, 7-Eleven and Citibank ones do and usually have English menus as well (more recently, Mitsubishi-UFJ has opened its ATMs to UnionPay and Discover card users, while Mitsui-Sumitomo allows the use of UnionPay cards for a Â¥75 surcharge regardless of time of day). *NOTE* As of June 2013, Family Mart and 7-Eleven ATMs would not accept a UK registered Mastercard. Post Office (Japan Post) ATMs worked no problem.
Although <b>credit cards</b> are more and more widely accepted, they are far less widespread than in most other developed countries.  The crime rate is very low, so don't be afraid of carrying around wads of cash as the Japanese do. The average Japanese citizen will carry a month's worth of expenses on them (around Â¥40,000 give or take). See <i>Buy</i> under <a href="/en/Japan#Buy" title="Japan">Japan</a>. for general caveats regarding electronics and media compatibility.
There are numerous convenience stores throughout Tokyo, which are open around the clock and sell not only food and magazines, but also daily necessities such as underwear and toiletries. Supermarkets are usually open until 22:00, while drugstores and department stores usually close at 21:00.
<a href="/en/Tokyo/Akihabara" title="Tokyo/Akihabara">Akihabara</a>, Tokyo's Electric Town, is now also the unquestioned center of its <i>otaku</i> community, and the stores along Chuo-dori are packed to the rafters with <i>anime</i> (animation) and <i>manga</i> (comics).
Another popular district for all things manga/anime is the <a href="/en/Tokyo/Nakano" title="Tokyo/Nakano">Nakano</a> ward and its Broadway Shopping arcade. Check out the mandarake shop for loads of used and rare mangas.
In recent years there has been an "otaku boom" in Akihabara.  A lot of attention in particular was paid to the town thanks to the popular Japanese drama "Densha Otoko", a love story about an otaku who saves a woman on a train and their subsequent courtship.
Akihabara was previously known for its many live performances and <i>cosplayers</i>, some of which had drawn negative attention due to extremist performers. These have become increasingly scarce following the <i>Akihabara massacre</i> in 2008, although girls in various maid costumes can still be seen standing along the streets handing out advertisement fliers to passers by for <i>Maid Cafes</i>.
Serious collectors should head for the <b>Antique Mall</b> in <a href="/en/Tokyo/Ginza" title="Tokyo/Ginza">Ginza</a> or the <b>Antique Market</b> in <a href="/en/Tokyo/Omotesando" title="Tokyo/Omotesando" class="mw-redirect">Omotesando</a>, which despite the rustic names are collections of small very specialist shops (samurai armor, <i>ukiyo-e</i> prints, etc) with head-spinning prices.  Mere mortals can venture over to <a href="/en/Tokyo/Suginami" title="Tokyo/Suginami">Nishi-Ogikubo</a>, where you can pick up scrolls of calligraphy and such for a few thousand yen.
The <b>Antique Festival</b> (å¨å½å¤æ°å·éª¨è£ç¥­ã) <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.kottouichi.jp/heiwajima.htm">[33]</a> is held over the weekend about 5-6 times a year at the Tokyo Ryutsu Center, on the Tokyo Monorail line, and is well worth a visit.
Jinbocho is to used books what Akihabara is to electronics. It's clustered around the Jinbocho subway stop.
The Blue Parrot is another shop located at Takadanobaba on the Yamanote line, just two stops north of Shinjuku.
Ever since Sony and Nikon became synonymous with high-tech quality, Tokyo has been a favored place for buying electronics and cameras. Though the lines have blurred since the PC revolution, each has its traditional territory and stores: <a href="/en/Tokyo/Akihabara#Buy" title="Tokyo/Akihabara"> Akihabara</a> has the electronics stores, including a large number of duty-free shops specializing in export models, and <a href="/en/Tokyo/Shinjuku#Buy" title="Tokyo/Shinjuku"> Shinjuku</a> has the camera stores. Unfortunately, local model electronics are not cheap, but the export models are similar to what you'll pay back home. you can sometimes find  cheap local models if you avoid big shops and check smaller retailers. It's also surprisingly difficult to find certain things e.g. games machines.
<a href="/en/Tokyo/Shibuya" title="Tokyo/Shibuya">Shibuya</a> and neighboring <a href="/en/Tokyo/Harajuku" title="Tokyo/Harajuku">Harajuku</a> are the best-known shopping areas for funky, youthful clothes and accessories.  Note that, almost without exception, clothes are sized for the petite Japanese frame.
Department stores and exclusive boutiques stock every fashion label imaginable, but for global labels prices in Tokyo are typically higher than anywhere else in the world.  The famous <a href="/en/Tokyo/Ginza" title="Tokyo/Ginza">Ginza</a> and <a href="/en/Tokyo/Ikebukuro" title="Tokyo/Ikebukuro">Ikebukuro</a>'s giant <b>Seibu</b> and <b>Tobu</b> department stores (the largest in the world) are good hunting grounds.  Recently, <a href="/en/Tokyo/Roppongi" title="Tokyo/Roppongi">Roppongi Hills</a> has emerged as a popular area for high-end shopping, with many major global brands. Other department stores in Tokyo are <b>Mitsukoshi</b>, <b>Sogo</b>, <b>Marui</b> (OIOI), and <b>Takashimaya</b>. Mitsukoshi is Japan's biggest department store chain. Its anchor store is in Nihonbashi. <b>Marui Men</b> store in <a href="/en/Shinjuku" title="Shinjuku" class="mw-redirect">Shinjuku</a> has eight floors of high-end fashion for men only.
The district for this is <b>Kappabashi Street</b> near <a href="/en/Tokyo/Asakusa#Buy" title="Tokyo/Asakusa">Asakusa</a>, also known as âKitchen Town.â The street is lined with stores selling all kinds of kitchen wares â this is where the restaurants of Tokyo get their supplies.  It's also a great place to find <b>cheap Japanese ceramics</b>, not to mention plastic food!
Ochanomizu is to the guitar what Jinbocho is to used books. There, youâll find what must be the worldâs densest collection of guitar shops. Plenty of other musical instruments (though not traditional Japanese ones) are also available.
For touristy Japanese knickknacks, the best places to shop are <b>Nakamise</b> in <a href="/en/Tokyo/Asakusa" title="Tokyo/Asakusa">Asakusa</a> and the <b>Oriental Bazaar</b> in <a href="/en/Tokyo/Omotesando" title="Tokyo/Omotesando" class="mw-redirect">Omotesando</a>, which stock all the kitschy things like <i>kanji</i>-emblazoned T-shirts, foreigner-sized kimonos, ninja outfits for kids and ersatz samurai swords that can be surprisingly difficult to find elsewhere.  Both also have a selection of serious antiques for the connoisseur, but see also <a href="#Antiques">Antiques</a> above.
Bustling open-air bazaars in the Asian style are rare in Tokyo, except for <a href="/en/Tokyo/Ueno" title="Tokyo/Ueno">Ueno</a>'s <b>Ameyoko</b>, a legacy of the postwar occupation.  <b>Yanaka Ginza</b> in the Shitamachi <a href="/en/Tokyo/Taito" title="Tokyo/Taito">Taito</a> district, a very nice example of a neighborhood shopping street, makes for an interesting afternoon browse.
There are often small flea and antique markets in operation on the weekend at major (and minor) shrines in and around Tokyo.
The sheer quantity and variety of food in Tokyo will amaze you. Department stores have food halls, typically in the basement, with food which surpasses top delicatessans in other world cities. Some basements of train stations have supermarkets with free taste testers. It's a great way to sample some of the strange dishes they have for free. 
Tokyo has a large number of restaurants, so see the main <a href="/en/Japan#Eat" title="Japan">Japan</a> guide for the types of food you will encounter and some popular chains. Menus are often posted outside, so you can check the prices. Some shops have the famous plastic food in their front windows. Don't hesitate to drag the waiting staff out to the front to point at what you want.  Always carry cash. Many restaurants will not accept credit cards.
Tokyo has literally tens of thousands of restaurants representing more or less every cuisine in the world, but it also offers a few unique local specialties. <i>Nigirizushi</i> (fish pressed onto rice), known around the world around simply as "sushi," in fact originates from Tokyo.  Another is <i>monjayaki</i> (ããããç¼ã), a gooey, cabbage-filled version of <i>okonomiyaki</i> that uses a very thin batter to achieve a sticky, caramelized consistency. It is originally from the Tsukishima area of <a href="/en/Tokyo/Chuo" title="Tokyo/Chuo">Chuo</a> and today there are many restaurants near Asakusa offering monjayaki.
Go to a <b>convenience store</b> (<i>konbini</i>), there is one on every second corner. Really, the options may surprise you. You can get rice balls (<i>onigiri</i>), bread-rolls, salads, prepared foods (like <i>nikuman</i> and <i>oden</i>), and drinks (both hot and cold) for &#165;100-150, <i>bento</i> lunch boxes for around &#165;500 and sandwiches for &#165;250-350.  At most convenience stores, microwaves are available to heat up your food for no additional cost. <b>Supermarkets</b> (<i>suupaa</i>) are usually cheaper and offer a wider choice, but more difficult to find.  (Try Asakusa and the sidestreets of Ueno's Ameyoko market for local--not big chain--supermarkets.) Also, the <b>100 yen shop</b> (hyaku en), have become very common, and most have a selection convenient, ready to eat, items. There are 100 yen shops near most minor train stations, and usually tucked away somewhere within two or three blocks of the big stations. In particular, look for the "99" and "Lawson 100" signs these chains are esentially small grocery stores.
Also, look for <i>bentÅ</i> shops like Hokka-Hokka-Tei which sell take-out lunch boxes. They range in quality and cost, but most offer good, basic food at a reasonable price. This is what students and office workers often eat.
Noodle shops, curry shops, and bakeries are often the best option for people eating on the cheap. They are everywhere. The <b>noodle bars</b> on every corner are great for filling up and are very cheap at &#165;200-1000.  You buy your meal ticket from a vending machine at the door with pictures of the dishes and hand it to the serving staff.  The one question you will typically have to answer for the counterman is whether you want <b>soba</b> (thin brown buckwheat) or <b>udon</b> (thick white wheat) noodles.  
Some offer standing room only with a counter to place your bowl, while others have limited counter seating.  During peak times, you need to be quick as others will be waiting.
Fast food is available just about everywhere, including many American chains like McDonald's and KFC. But if you are visiting Japan from overseas, and wish to sample Japanese fast food, why not try MOS Burger, Freshness Burger, Lotteria, or First Kitchen? If you're looking for something more Japanese, try one of the local fast food giants, <b>Matsuya</b>, <b>Yoshinoya</b> or <b>Ootoya</b>. For under Â¥500, you can get a giant bowl of meat, rice, and vegetables, sometimes with egg thrown in for good measure.  Drinking water or hot <b>ocha</b> (Japanese green tea) is usually available at no extra cost.
Raw fish enthusiasts are urged to try <i>kaitenzushi</i> (conveyor belt sushi), where the prices are very reasonable. Prices are depending on the color of the plate, so be sure to check before they start to pile up.
Many of the larger train and subway stations have fast, cheap eateries.  Around most stations, there will be ample choices of places to eat, including chain coffeeshops (which often serve sandwiches, baked goods, and pasta dishes), yakitori places, and even Italian restaurants.
By tradition the basement of almost any department store, including Mitsukoshi, Matsuzakaya, or Isetan, is devoted to the <i>depachika</i> (ããå°ä¸), a huge array of small shops selling all kinds of prepared take-out food.  You can assemble a delicious if slightly pricey picnic here &#8212; or, if you're feeling really cheap, just go around eating free samples!  The very largest department stores are Tobu and Seibu in <a href="/en/Tokyo/Ikebukuro" title="Tokyo/Ikebukuro">Ikebukuro</a>, but <a href="/en/Tokyo/Shibuya" title="Tokyo/Shibuya">Shibuya</a>, <a href="/en/Tokyo/Ginza" title="Tokyo/Ginza">Ginza</a> and in fact any major Tokyo district will have their fair share. <a href="/en/Tokyo/Shinjuku" title="Tokyo/Shinjuku">Shinjuku</a> Station is home to several famous department stores, such as the Keio and Odakyu department stores. Many stores begin discounting their selections at about 19:00 each night.  Look for signs and stickers indicating specific yen value or percentage discounts. You will often see half-price stickers which read åå¤ã(<i>hanne</i>). This discounting is also common at supermarkets located at the smaller stations, although the quality may be a notch or two down from the department stores, it's still perfectly edible.
The ubiquitous <i>izakaya</i>, a cross between a pub and a casual restaurant, invariably serve a good range of Japanese dishes and can be good places to fill up without breaking the bank: in most, an evening of eating and drinking won't cost more than around &#165;3000 per person.  See <a href="#Drink">Drink</a> for details.
Tokyo has the world's highest number of Michelin-starred restaurants priced to match, but one splurge is worthwhile even if you're on a limited budget: the <b>best sushi</b> in town, if not the world, can be found in <a href="/en/Tokyo/Tsukiji" title="Tokyo/Tsukiji" class="mw-redirect">Tsukiji</a>, fresh from the famous fish market.  Figure on &#165;3000 for a set meal, which is a bargain compared to how much sushi of similar caliber would cost elsewhere, even in Tokyo. A sushi breakfast in Tsukiji, after exploring the fish market, is a great option for the jet-lagged traveler's first morning in Tokyo. Arrive on or before the first train to avoid waiting up to two hours for a place at the sushi bar.
For upmarket Japanese eats, <a href="/en/Tokyo/Ginza" title="Tokyo/Ginza">Ginza</a> is guaranteed to burn a hole in your wallet, with <a href="/en/Tokyo/Akasaka" title="Tokyo/Akasaka">Akasaka</a> and <a href="/en/Tokyo/Roppongi" title="Tokyo/Roppongi">Roppongi Hills</a> close behind.  You can limit the damage considerably by eating fixed lunch sets instead of dinner, as this is when restaurants cater to people paying their own meals instead of using the company expense account.
The party never stops in Tokyo (at least in the karaoke bars), and you will find good little bars and restaurants everywhere.
The most Japanese way to spend a night out would be at Japanese-style watering holes called <i>izakaya</i> (å±éå±), which offer food and drink in a convivial, pub-like atmosphere (see <a href="/en/Japan#Drink" title="Japan">Japan</a> for details). Cheaper chain <i>izakaya</i> like <b>Tsubohachi</b> (ã¤ã¼å«) and <b>Shirokiya</b> (ç½æ¨å±) usually have picture menus, so ordering is simple, even if you don't know Japanese - but don't be surprised if some places have Japanese only touchscreen ordering systems.
Visiting clubs and western-style night spots can get expensive, with clubs and live houses enforcing weekend cover charges in the Â¥2000-5000 bracket (usually including a drink coupon or two). For a splurge on a beverage or two, Western Shinjuku's Park Hyatt Tokyo houses the New York Bar on level 52. Providing stunning views day and night across Tokyo, it was also the setting for the movie <i>Lost in Translation</i>. Cocktails here start around Â¥1400 - single malt whiskies are upwards of Â¥2000.
If you're new in town, <a href="/en/Tokyo/Roppongi" title="Tokyo/Roppongi">Roppongi</a> is home to a number of vibrant clubs and establishments which specialize in serving non-Japanese - but it's also overflowing with hostesses and 'patrons' who will occasionally hassle you to visit their gentlemen's clubs, where drinks cost Â¥5000 and up. Nonetheless, the party scene thrives in Roppongi, in which case it might be a good idea to check out one of the many independently produced events such as the <a href="#Do">Tokyo Pub Crawl</a>. As an alternative, some Japanese and foreign nationals instead prefer the clubs and bars in <a href="/en/Tokyo/Shibuya" title="Tokyo/Shibuya">Shibuya</a>, or trendy <a href="/en/Tokyo/Ginza" title="Tokyo/Ginza">Ginza</a>, <a href="/en/Tokyo/Ebisu" title="Tokyo/Ebisu">Ebisu</a>, or <a href="/en/Tokyo/Shinjuku" title="Tokyo/Shinjuku">Shinjuku</a>.
<b>The Hub</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://pub-hub.com/">[34]</a>, a chain of British-style pubs, has branches in <a href="/en/Tokyo/Shinjuku" title="Tokyo/Shinjuku">Shinjuku</a>, <a href="/en/Tokyo/Shibuya" title="Tokyo/Shibuya">Shibuya</a>, and <a href="/en/Tokyo/Roppongi" title="Tokyo/Roppongi">Roppongi</a> (as well as near most major stations) and is reasonably priced, but is often used by foreigners and Japanese who want a bit of "action".  Other British/Irish pubs can be found in Roppongi, Shinjuku and Shibuya.  Expect to pay around Â¥1000 a pint, although happy hours can reduce this by a few hundred yen.
In <a href="/en/Tokyo/Shibuya" title="Tokyo/Shibuya">Shibuya</a>, the bar area behind 109 (not 109-2) and next to Dogenzaka ("Love Hotel Hill") has a large number of clubs.  Unlike those in Roppongi and Shibuya's Gas Panic, these clubs have entrance fees, but clubs without entrance fees often hassle you all night to buy drinks which ends up just as expensive and without people who are actually there to enjoy the music. <a href="/en/Tokyo/Shinjuku" title="Tokyo/Shinjuku">Shinjuku</a> is home to Kabukicho, Japan's largest red-light district.  Also in Shinjuku is the gay bar district of Shinjuku-nichome.  A little further from the city center are <a href="/en/Tokyo/Shimokitazawa" title="Tokyo/Shimokitazawa" class="mw-redirect">Shimokitazawa</a>, <a href="/en/Tokyo/Koenji" title="Tokyo/Koenji" class="mw-redirect">Koenji</a> and <a href="/en/Tokyo/Nakano" title="Tokyo/Nakano">Nakano</a>, full of good bars, restaurants and "live houses" offering underground/indie music popular with students and 20/30-somethings.
There are thousands of hotels in the Tokyo area, ranging from cheap to very expensive. They are distributed throughout the city, with some of the high end and the low end almost everywhere. Many Western-style hotels, especially those affiliated with American hotel chains, have English-speaking staff.
<br />
Much of Tokyo's budget accommodation can be found in the <a href="/en/Tokyo/Taito" title="Tokyo/Taito">Taito</a> area, especially <a href="/en/Tokyo/Asakusa" title="Tokyo/Asakusa">Asakusa</a> and <a href="/en/Tokyo/Ueno" title="Tokyo/Ueno">Ueno</a>.  But if you are not afraid of being a little bit off-center, you may have a look to the surroundings: <a href="/en/Yokohama" title="Yokohama">Yokohama</a>, etc.
Do note that most of the cheap accommodations in the Taito area (near JR Minami-senjuu) have curfew times around 22:00 to 23:00, so be sure to check that in advance if it bothers you. One hotel that does not have a curfew is Kangaroo Hotel <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.kangaroohotel.jp/">[35]</a>, rooms starting at &#165;3200. There's also Economy Hotel Hoteiya <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.e-conomyhotels.jp/hotels/hoteiya.html">[36]</a>, rooms starting at &#165;2500. You can also find a bed in a dormitory at TokyoBackpackers Hotel in Minami-Senju, from 2100Â¥ a night, with weekly or monthly discounts <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://tokyo-backpackers.com/en/">[37]</a>. A list of economy hotels in Tokyo is <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.e-conomyhotels.jp/list.html">[38]</a>.
Capsule hotels are generally the cheapest option. They may be reluctant to play host to foreigners as there are quite a few rules of behavior which may be difficult to explain; see the <a href="/en/Japan#Sleep" title="Japan">Japan</a> article for the full scoop.  Most capsule hotels are men-only. <b>Asakusa Riverside</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.asakusa-capsule.jp/english/">[39]</a> and <b>Akihabara Capsule Inn</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.capsuleinn.com/index.html">[40]</a> are among the very few to have women-only floors.
24-hour comic book library/internet cafes known as manga kisa, have become common around Tokyo. This is one of the cheapest ways to crash if you miss your last train and need to wait for the early morning transit service to get started. No bed, but you have a comfy chair and a PC and/or DVDs if you can't sleep. Later in the evening, karaoke boxes often offer discounted prices for the whole night, they usually have a couch you can sleep on. Most of these cyber cafes charge &#165;1500â2500 for 8 hours.
One of the cheapest ways to stay can be also a youth hostel, prices start at &#165;1200, e.g. in the <a href="/en/Tokyo/Shinjuku" title="Tokyo/Shinjuku">Shinjuku</a> area.
If you are <i>truly</i> on a budget, it is possible to go homeless and <a href="/en/Urban_camping_in_Japan" title="Urban camping in Japan">camp</a> in public parks, for free. You can do this with a tent, if you want to carry one, and you can also sleep on benches, as exhausted salarymen and students do. It is also possible to do this all over Japan&#160;; by doing <i>nojuku</i> (as the Japanese call it) and eating in convenience stores or making your own sandwiches from the food you buy in supermarkets, you can stay in Tokyo for around the same price as it would cost you in Kathmandu, Nepal&#160;!
There is a wide range of choices in hotels while at Tokyo, most of the hotels are rated 3 stars or more. Tokyo is among most of the other cities when it comes to hotels because their services and hotel locations are the best of the best.
Keep an eye out for what is called a <b>business hotel</b>.  The rooms are usually tiny, but they are conveniently located near stations and rates start from around &#165;6000.  Staff may speak minimal English, but it's not too hard to figure out. These are the best options for solo travelers.  Affordable chains found throughout Tokyo include <b>Tokyu Stay</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.tokyuhotels.co.jp/en/index.html">[41]</a>, which offers free internet access and breakfast, <b>Chisun</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.solarehotels.com/english/chisun/">[42]</a> and <b>Sunroute</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.sunroute.jp/SunrouteTopHLE.html">[43]</a>.
Tokyo has some self-proclaimed <i>ryokan</i> (Japanese inns) that cater largely to foreign tourists, mostly concentrated around <a href="/en/Tokyo/Ueno" title="Tokyo/Ueno">Ueno</a> and <a href="/en/Tokyo/Asakusa" title="Tokyo/Asakusa">Asakusa</a>.  While not as opulent as the real thing, they offer a sample of Japanese home life at affordable rates.
Japan's infamous <b>love hotels</b> can be a reasonable (and interesting) option in Tokyo.  Shibuya's <a href="/en/Tokyo/Shibuya#Sleep" title="Tokyo/Shibuya">Dogenzaka</a> ("Love Hotel Hill") offers the widest selection in the city. If you're really going to spend the night, be sure to check in for a "stay" rather than a "rest". Be warned that some love hotels (at least around Shinjuku) have a 'No Japanese, no stay' policy, presumably to avoid confusion over billing; others lock you into your room until you pay into a slot by the door to leave.
If you plan to stay more than one week, you can try Weekly-Mansion Tokyo <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.wmt.co.jp/en/">[44]</a>. These are flats you can rent for short periods of time for affordable prices. Rates are around &#165;5000 per day for one person or a little more for two people. Sometimes you can find deals for as low as &#165;4000 per day (Various promotional deals are available for online reservations). You can also make  online reservations in English.
You can spend a fortune on accommodation in Tokyo. Most of the high-end international chains are well represented.  Particular concentrations of luxury hotels can be found in western <a href="/en/Tokyo/Shinjuku" title="Tokyo/Shinjuku">Shinjuku</a> (including the Park Hyatt Tokyo, featured in <i>Lost in Translation</i>), around Tokyo station (best here are <b>Shangri-La Hotel, Tokyo</b>,<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.shangri-la.com/tokyo/shangrila">[45]</a>. Mandarin Oriental, Tokyo, Seiyo Ginza and Four Seasons Marunouchi), and in <a href="/en/Tokyo/Akasaka" title="Tokyo/Akasaka">Akasaka</a>.
Beware of hotels marketing themselves as being located at "Tokyo Bay".  At best, this means you'll be in or near the <a href="/en/Tokyo/Odaiba" title="Tokyo/Odaiba">Odaiba</a> district, built on reclaimed land half an hour away from the city center; at worst, you'll end up somewhere on the coast of the adjacent prefecture of <a href="/en/Chiba" title="Chiba">Chiba</a>, which is handy for visiting <a href="/en/Tokyo_Disneyland" title="Tokyo Disneyland" class="mw-redirect">Tokyo Disneyland</a> but quite inconvenient for touring Tokyo itself.
Good connections are available at Internet cafes everywhere. Expect to pay &#165;400-&#165;500 per hour. "Gera Gera" is a popular chain. Paid WiFi service is also taking off in Tokyo with reasonable coverage - at a price. WiFi services are probably not convenient for those just visiting.
If you bring your own computer with a WLAN card, it is possible to find wireless connections in fast food outlets like McDonald's or Mos Burger.  You also have a good chance to find a connection in one of the numerous coffee shops.  Just look for a wireless connection sign in the front window or computers within the shop.  Note that free wireless is not nearly as prevalent in Japan as it is in the West.
Tokyo is probably one of the safest big cities you will ever visit, and Japan in general is one of the safest places to visit in the world. Most people, including single female travellers, would not encounter any problems walking along the streets alone at night. Street crime is extremely rare, even late at night, and continues to decrease. However, <b>"little crime" does not mean "no crime"</b>, and common sense should still be applied as anywhere in the world.  Often the biggest risk is travellers taking Japan's visibly apparent lack of crime too close to heart and doing things they would never do back home. 
The most common crime is sexual harassment on crowded trains -- when people are pressed up against each other, hands wander. This is more of a local problem as westerners are considered more aggressive and more likely to stick up for themselves. The best way to deal with any wandering hands is to yell "chikaan" which is a widely publicized Japanese term for sexual harassment, specifically groping on trains.
Small police stations, or <b>Koban</b>, can be found every few blocks.  If you get lost or need assistance, by all means go to them; it's their job to help you!  They may, however, have difficulties with English, so some knowledge of the Japanese language helps.
Take the usual precautions against pickpockets in crowded areas and trains. Also be aware that theft is more likely to occur in hangouts and bars popular with travellers and non-residents.
The red-light and nightlife districts can be a bit seedy, but are rarely dangerous. Note some small, back-street drinking establishments in red-light districts have been known to charge extortionate prices. Similar problems exist in the seedier upscale clubs in Roppongi, where it may be wise to check cover charges and drink prices in advance.

If you make it as far out as the <a href="/en/Izu_Islands" title="Izu Islands">Izu Islands</a>, note that visitors to <a href="/en/Miyakejima" title="Miyakejima">Miyakejima Island</a> have in the past been required to carry a gas mask, due to volcanic gases. Those in poor health are advised against travelling to the island.
Being the national capital, Tokyo hosts a large number of embassies.  A number of them are located in Minato-ku (the financial district), Shinjuku-ku, Shibuya-ku, &amp; Chiyoda-ku (seat of government) in the central part of town.  Several embassies are also located within the same building at No.38 Kowa Building  4-12-24 Nishi-Azabu, Minato-ku. They can be elsewhere too, see below:
