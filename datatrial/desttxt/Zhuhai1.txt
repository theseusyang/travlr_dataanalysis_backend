<b>Zhuhai</b> (ç æµ·; <i>ZhÅ«hÇi</i>) <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.zhuhai.gov.cn">[1]</a> is the name of a city, and <a href="/en/List_of_Chinese_provinces_and_regions#Development_zones" title="List of Chinese provinces and regions">Special Economic Zone</a> (SEZ), in <a href="/en/Guangdong" title="Guangdong">Guangdong</a> Province, <a href="/en/China" title="China">China</a>. The name means <i>Pearl Sea</i>; Zhuhai is where the Pearl River (ç æ±; <i>ZhÅ«jiÄng</i>) flows into the South Sea (åæµ· <i>NÃ¡nhÇi</i>).
Zhuhai is known for its beautiful long coastline, waving palm trees, open spaces, low population density, and its many islands; Zhuhai's nicknames are <i>the city for lovers</i> and <i>the city of a hundred islands</i>. Zhuhai serves as the gateway to Macau, as a tourist destination for Chinese, and as a playground for hedonistic Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan visitors who come for Zhuhai's very colorful nightlife and available <i>female companionship</i> at mainland prices.
Located in the <a href="/en/Pearl_River_Delta" title="Pearl River Delta">Pearl River Delta</a>, Zhuhai borders <a href="/en/Jiangmen" title="Jiangmen">Jiangmen</a> to the northwest, <a href="/en/Zhongshan" title="Zhongshan">Zhongshan</a> to the north, and former Portuguese colony <a href="/en/Macau" title="Macau">Macau</a> to the south. By sea, former British colony <a href="/en/Hong_Kong" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a> and <a href="/en/Shenzhen" title="Shenzhen">Shenzhen</a> are just across the bay to the east. The provincial capital <a href="/en/Guangzhou" title="Guangzhou">Guangzhou</a> is about 150 km to the north.
The Zhuhai area has been inhabited for thousands of years. Until the 1970s, Zhuhai was a group of fishing villages with a population of around 100,000. Since 1980, when it was designated a Special Economic Zone by the central government, Zhuhai has expanded to include nearby areas and is now a fast-growing modern city with well over a million inhabitants.  However, it is still not as large and developed as neighboring cities like <a href="/en/Shenzhen" title="Shenzhen">Shenzhen</a> and <a href="/en/Guangzhou" title="Guangzhou">Guangzhou</a>. Zhuhai's northern districts of Jinding and Tangjia, as well as the western district of Doumen, are less developed factory-driven areas that retain a deeper working-man, salt-of-the-earth quality.
Zhuhai is one of China's cleanest and prettiest cities, and received numerous accolades for its excellent ecological development efforts. In 1998, it was awarded the <i>International Award for Best Practices in Improving Living Environment</i> by the United Nations Center for Human Settlements. It is also commonly agreed to be one of the best cities in China to retire in. With a low population density compared to other larger cities in China, Zhuhai is unsurprisingly greener. Parks and open spaces dot the cityscape, and waving palm trees line the extensive coastline and many of the major streets.
The weather in Zhuhai is sub-tropical. Temperature varies between 10C/50F degrees in winter (Dec to Feb) to a hot and humid 35C/95F degrees in summer (Jun to Sep). Typhoons are also a possibility in summer. The best times to visit are during spring and fall.
The city of Zhuhai itself is composed of <b>Gongbei</b>, <b>Jida</b> and <b>Xiangzhou</b>. The other areas mentioned are districts within the Zhuhai Special Economic Zone.
North to South along the coast, the main districts are:
Going West from Gongbei are other districts:

One of Zhuhai's nicknames is <i>the city of a hundred islands</i> (146 to be exact), and it has a number of islands that are accessible from ports by ferries. An often overlooked aspect is the fact that each of the islands has a unique character. Some have decent beaches, and some are eerily quiet fishing islands. Each trip is a noticeable escape from the hustle and bustle of living in Chinese cities. A trip to the islands is arguably comparable to leaving the country. High-quality seafood abounds. Information about where to go or what to do can be difficult to come by because most locals do not visit due to cost of transportation. As a result, most tourists do not get a chance to explore these beautiful places at all, and most of the information available on the internet regarding Zhuhai focuses on the urban areas. Nonetheless, the curious expat or adventurous traveler will be generously rewarded. From the <b>Xiangzhou Northern Wharf</b> (é¦æ´²åå ¤ç å¤´; <i>XiÄngzhÅu BÄidÄ«mÇtÃ³u</i>), you can get to the <b>Wanshan Islands</b> (ä¸å±±ç¾¤å²; <i>WÃ nshÄnqÃºndÇo</i>):
While not as distant and not part of the Wanshan Islands, <b>Henquin Island</b>, <b>Qi'ao Island</b>, and <b>Gaolan Island</b> can all be reached by bus via a bridge.
Remember to take plenty of cash with you on these island excursions because some islands do not have ATMs.

Most visitors to China will require an advance visa, which can be obtained in Hong Kong or Macau. See <a href="/en/China#Visas" title="China">Visas</a> for details.
If you are only visiting the Zhuhai area, three-day visas upon arrival are available at the border. Upon entering the Gongbei immigration building, after passing all the duty free shops, the visa office is behind a green door on the right hand side of the hall. Follow the stairs and you will find the office on the left. You need to complete a small white form, pay the fee and have your photograph taken with a webcam. The visa is then processed within minutes. This costs Â¥160 for most nationalities, but Americans cannot use the service and Brits have to fork out Â¥450 (December 2008). Hong Kong dollars are not accepted. Currency can be converted at the China Tourist Services office back downstairs in the main immigration hall, but usually at an awful rate. Once the visa has been issued, proceed to the immigration hall to complete the immigration process.
(january 2011: I applied for a SEZ visa. The price list did have USA as a nationality, the price being about &#165;950)
<b>Zhuhai Airport</b> (IATA: ZUH) <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.zhairport.com">[3]</a>. This is a moderately sized, modern airport that connects the area with many Chinese cities, but not many international destinations. It is located west of downtown in Doumen District. Budget carrier Spring Airlines <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://tour.china-sss.com/">[4]</a> flies here daily from <a href="/en/Shanghai" title="Shanghai">Shanghai</a>.
The Airport Express Bus departs from the airport to Xiangzhen and Gongbei districts for Â¥30 (November 2010) per passenger, and follows the schedule of arriving flights. The first bus departs around 11:00 AM and the last bus departs about 21:30. A taxi from the airport to Gongbei or Jiuzhou in downtown Zhuhai is around Â¥130 (October 2011) when traffic is free flowing. You may also take public bus number 207, which goes right to the Gongbei border crossing, and costs Â¥6. However the journey time is between 1 hour 45 mins and 2 hours. Note that this bus does not have a luggage storage area on board.
Zhuhai can also be easily reached by bus from the Guangzhou airport (see below).
To reach Zhuhai from outside China, one would usually fly to <a href="/en/Hong_Kong" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a>, <a href="/en/Macau" title="Macau">Macau</a> or <a href="/en/Guangzhou" title="Guangzhou">Guangzhou</a>. All three cities have large, modern airports with many international connections and all are within an hour or two of Zhuhai; Macau is closest. <a href="/en/Shenzhen" title="Shenzhen">Shenzhen</a> is another large modern airport nearby, but it has fewer international connections.
From the <b>Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport</b> (IATA: CAN) <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.baiyunairport.com">[5]</a>, a frequent express bus service that goes to Zhuhai is available. It costs Â¥80 and takes approximately 2.5 hours with one stop in the northern part of Zhuhai before going on to the Gongbei border gate to Macau. There is a check in for the airport at Gongbei bus station, located near the KFC.
From the <b>Macau International Airport</b> (IATA: MFM) <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.macau-airport.gov.mo">[6]</a>, the best way to get to Zhuhai is via the <i>Express Link</i> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.macau-airport.com/en/v01/01_express.php">[7]</a> service, skipping the Macau immigration and customs altogether. Once you deboard the plane, instead of going through immigration, look for the Express Link (China) sign and follow it. This will lead you past a transit security scan station where you must pick up an Express Link card, and upstairs into the departure hall. Go to the ticket counter at Gate 8, present your card and buy a ticket for the coach that goes to the Gongbei border (past Macau, before Zhuhai). The coach fare is Â¥52 and the ride takes only 15 minutes. Coach departure times are 11AM, 11:30AM, 12PM, 12:30PM, 1PM, 2:45PM, 5PM, 5:30PM, 6PM and 6PM.  If you need to check in any bags for your flight, remember to have them <i>blue tagged</i> during your flight check-in procedure for this Express Link service. The blue tag is not a necessity, merely a convenience. Present your luggage tags at the above-mentioned coach ticket counter and pick up your bags at the bus bay later.
The option to skip the Macau immigration is not available on the return. Allow <i>at least</i> three hours to get from Gongbei to the Macau airport. Immigration formalities can be very time-consuming, particularly on the Chinese side during the weekends. Once out of the Chinese customs (before entering Macau), there is a little ticket booth to the left where you can get a shuttle bus ticket to the airport for Â¥35. The buses will be waiting on the left once you leave the Macau immigration hall. They run at 10 minutes intervals.
Should you decide to go through the Macau immigration at the airport and use the Taxi service to get to Zhuhai, the ride takes only about 15 minutes. It costs about Â¥60-80 for the short ride. But it is reasonable priced for those (&gt;2 persons) who wish to share the taxi cab fees. The charges are inclusive of surcharge of Â¥5 at the airport, Â¥5 per piece of luggage. Taxi payment can be in Macau, HongKong or Chinese currencies. They are all treated equally in value. (ie. dollar for dollar, even though Macau dollar has the lowest value of the three currencies). Taxi cabs queue at the curve outside of the airport. Beware of fake note at this point. You may switch on your China mobile phone once you reaches the mid span of the Friendship bridge. The reception is rather good from this point onwards.
Crossing into Zhuhai, China through the Gongbei port takes about 20-30 minutes. The Gongbei immigration office open for border crossing starting from 7:00am. For foreigner entering China, you will need to produce a valid visa.  Follow the immigration line that say "Foreigner". Once you clear immigration, you are now entering the duty free zone. Chocolate, Western liquor and cigarette are popular gifts to the Chinese. These foreign goods are extremely rare and expensive in mainland China. So they serve as very attractive gifts to the Chinese. As a foreigner, you are also required to fill up an entry form, indicating your place of stay in China and your departure detail. Please ensure you fill up this slip before queuing at the Chinese Immigration line.
When you exit the Gongbei immigration building, you have reached the Zhuhai border. If you need to purchase a pre-paid cellphone card, please proceed to exit the immigration building, then walk downstair to the underground mall. There are many telephone services stalls here. You may purchase a pre-paid sim-card here for &#165;100. It comes with a loaded value of &#165;50. You will need a GSM phone to get it to work. Always keep your belonging zipped inside your pocket here as pick-pocket is very common at the border check point.
From <b>Hong Kong International Airport</b> (IATA: HKG) <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.hongkongairport.com">[8]</a>, one option is to take the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.mtr.com.hk/eng/train/ae_intro.htm">Airport Express</a> to Kowloon Station (at the cost of HK$90), then hop on the free Airport Express transit bus K2 to the China-Hong Kong Ferry Terminal (ä¸­æ¸¯åç å¤´; <i>ZhÅnggÇngchÃ©ngmÇtÃ³u</i>) to take a ferry to Zhuhai. See below for ferry timetable.
Another option from Hong Kong is to catch a ferry from the HKIA Skypier to Macau and then cross into Zhuhai via the Gongbei border gate. Immigration and custom procedures can be skipped at the Hong Kong end. Full instructions can be found here <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.hongkongairport.com/eng/aguide/skypier.html#airflow">[9]</a>. The ferry journey takes about 50 minutes and runs hourly (usually).
A third option from HKIA is now available in the form of long-distance buses that go overland to Gongbei. The journey takes 3.5 hours and costs HK$200. Departure times are 7AM, 8AM, 4PM, 5PM and 7PM.
A new ferry service is just introduced (twice daily for now) that brings travelers directly from HKIA to the Jiuzhou Port in Zhuhai. The ferry leaves at 12:15PM, 2:04PM, 5PM and 8PM. The one from Zhuhai to HKIA leaves at 9:30AM, 12:40PM, 3:30PM and 18:30PM. The trip takes approximately 50 minutes.
<b>From Hong Kong</b>: There are several ferries per day from <b>Hong Kong International Airport</b>, <b>HK-Macau Ferry Terminal</b> (æ¸¯æ¾³ç å¤´; <i>GÇngÃ omÇtÃ³u</i>; <a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Hong_Kong/Hong_Kong_Island&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Hong Kong/Hong Kong Island (page does not exist)">Hong Kong/Hong Kong Island</a>), <b>China Ferry Terminal</b> (ä¸­æ¸¯åç å¤´; <i>ZhÅng GÇngchÃ©ngmÇ tÃ³u</i>; <a href="/en/Hong_Kong/Kowloon" title="Hong Kong/Kowloon">Kowloon</a>) and <b>Shekou Ferry Terminal</b> (èå£æ¸¯; <i>ShÃ©kÇugÇng</i>; <a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Shekou&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Shekou (page does not exist)">Shekou</a>) arriving at the <b>Zhuhai Jiuzhou Ferry Terminal</b> (ä¹æ´²æ¸¯; <i>JiÇzhÅugÇng</i>).

Visas can be purchased here for most nationalities (not American citizens).  Payment is in RMB only and the ATMs are through immigration so plan ahead.
The HKIA-Zhuhai ferry is operated by <b>Chu Kong</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.cksp.com.hk/eng/skypier/timetable/main.html">[10]</a>, who charge HK$260/&#165;280 one-way to/from Zhuhai.

Only vehicles with dual plates are allowed to drive across the border.
Hundreds of buses come from <a href="/en/Guangzhou" title="Guangzhou">Guangzhou</a> every day, usually via the Jingzhu (Beijing-Zhuhai) Highway (äº¬ç é«é; JÄ«ngzhÅ«gÄosÃ¹). You can catch one at:

Zhuhai has several bus stations:
You can walk across the border from <a href="/en/Macau" title="Macau">Macau</a> at Gongbei. The border is open from 7am to midnight. It typically takes 20 minutes of walking time, but be prepared for long queues, which can easily add over an hour to your total border crossing time.
An alternative crossing is via the Lotus Bridge in Macau's Cotai area to the island of Hengqin. This border crossing point is open 8AM-8PM. After crossing the Macau side, take a shuttle bus across the bridge to the China side (fare Â¥3, no change given so carry the exact amount).

On the return trip from China to Macau, here are the border crossing tips from Zhuhai China to Macau via Gongbei port. The Gongbei immigration building opens at 7:00am. If you arrived at the Zhuhai Gongbei port via Taxi cab, you either arrive in front of the Gongbei immigration building or via the underground tunnel, linked to the underground mall below the Gongbei immigration building. Proceed to queue up at the entrance of building. It is rather cold in the morning so bring enough warm clothing with you if you decided to queue up in the morning before 7:00am.
When the building opens, proceed inside the building. Look for the line that says "Foreigner" (usually line# 15). If you are already late for your connecting flight, go to the express line (no queuing required) and show them your air ticket for immediate attention. Once you clear the Chinese immigration, you enter the duty-free zone. Proceed to the immigration hall. Foreigner is required to fill up a blue-color slip in this hall, declaring your place of stay in Macau and your departure details. Proceed to queue at the line that says "Foreigner". Once you clear the Macau immigration, proceed to exit the building. If you carry any luggage with you, the immigration officer may request that your luggage be scanned by the X-ray machine before you are allowed to exit the immigration building. The whole border crossing process takes about 20-25 minutes, excluding waiting time in the long queues.
You may choose Taxi cab or bus to get to the airport. The ride to the Macau International Airport takes only 15 minutes from Gongbei port. There will be surcharge of Macau$5 to the airport and $6 per item of luggage. It costs about Macau $70 to get to the airport by Taxi cab (inclusive of surcharges). Taxi cabs accepts Macau Patacas, Hong Kong Dollars or Chinese RMB for payment. These currencies are treated equally (With RMB being the most expensive) during payment. You may still use your Chinese pre-paid telephone card up to the mid-span of the Friendship Bridge in Macau. After that, the signal drops off.
The Guangzhou-Zhuhai Intercity Mass Rapid Transit (Guangzhu MRT) opened on 7 January 2011. Currently (Jan 6, 2013) line connect Guanzhou South railway station (Guangzhounan) and Zhuhai (near Gongbei (border cross point to Macao)). Price is dramatically changed (70 CNY for 2nd class in one way). Not in all information resource information about it updated. So take bus K1 (3 CNY) for reaching Zhuhai North Railway Station (ç æµ·åç«; <i>ZhÅ«hÃ¡i BÄi ZhÃ n</i>) (about 50 min) is not good idea, because it a little cheaper (55 CNY) but it same line and not every train Guangzhou - Zhuhai is stopped now on Zhuhai North Railway Station. Also price information is not updated too from Zhuhai North Railway Station' now 2nd class is 55 CNY, not 36 and full price from GZ to ZH cost 70 CNY. Trip time for full path about 1:20 from Zhuhai North Railway Station about 1 hour.
Bus routes 3A (to Jiuzhou ferry port) and 65 (to Zhulinpu in Tangjiawan) connect the station to the rest of Zhuhai, while there is also a minivan service to Beijing Normal University.  Reaching downtown Zhuhai from Zhuhai North station takes around 40-50 minutes by bus.  There is also a taxi queue immediately outside the station.
If your interesting in making your way straight to the Macau border, you can take the k1 bus directly from the station (ç æµ·åç«) to the Gongbei (æ±å) border crossing. The cost is 3 yuan, and it takes about 30 minutes.
Until the rail line extension comes into play, the direct downtown-to-downtown busses are likely to be faster and more convenient.
Zhuhai is quite spread out. The terrain is coastal plain broken up by mountains or, seen from the sea, a series of bays and headlands. There are many clumps of development separated by hills, often parkland.

Two universities are located along the main coastal road North of central Zhuhai, between Xiangzhou and Tangjia, accessible by bus 3, 10, 69 or the sightseeing bus:
Several more are further North, on a side road just before Jinding. Take bus 69 from town, bus 70 from Jinding, or bus 10A from Gongbei. The Zhuhai North train station is also in this area.
Always inspect the product before paying for it and leaving the shop. Also, note down where you bought the item. You will never get a refund, but Gongbei shop owners are surprisingly diligent about protecting their reputation, so they will more than likely exchange defective merchandise.

Zhuhai is known for its nightlife due to its status as a tourist destination for Chinese nationals, and as a playground for Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan businessmen looking for female company. Whether it's enjoying Chinese street life, mixing it up with all walks of life on Walking Street, sipping cocktails on Bar Street, or hitting the wild electronic discos, Zhuhai has what you're looking for!
For a truly unique experience, have a beer or coffee at one of the couple dozen open-air bar booths along Linhua Road (è²è±è·¯; <i>LiÃ¡nhuÄlÃ¹</i>; lit. Lotus Road; also known as Walking Street (æ­¥è¡è¡; <i>BÃ¹xÃ­ngjiÄ</i>)). It is parallel to Yingbin Road and a block east of it, starting on the western side of Gongbei Bus Station, opposite the northeast exit from the underground shopping complex at the Macau border. By day, it is a busy shopping street with numerous shops. It transforms into a spectacular must-see atmosphere at night. This area is filled with individual proprietary outdoor stalls for drinking and playing dice with the bar girls.  The bar girls earn commission on the drinks so their goal is to get you to buy as much beer as possible. Casual approaches by <i>working girls</i> are common, as are beggars who offer to sing or shine your shoes, or present their pet monkey or simply point to their baby sadly. There are two groups of outdoor bars with the one further south nearer the border emphasizing food (nothing special) and the one a little further north emphasizing drinks. There is a stretch of shops in between the two areas. Drinks are cheap (Â¥18 for a bottle of beer, fresh fruit juice or cup of coffee), and you get to meet all sorts of travelers, expats, Hong Kong and Macau residents coming over for shopping or cheaper entertainment, local wannabes, and working girls. Hanging out here is by far one of the most interesting things to do in Zhuhai. Use common sense late at night, as things can get pretty wild. Most stalls are open till 3AM, a few stay open later for enthusiastic customers.
Bar Street (éå§è¡; JiÇbÄjiÄ), at around 300 meters long, is a well-established, modern strip of more upscale bars, some featuring live music. It is easily the first place newcomers to Zhuhai go to experience the energy and liveliness of life in Zhuhai after dark. This strip primarily caters to Chinese businessmen, Chinese yuppies, and moneyed or uninformed tourists. It is one block in-land and a 20 minute walk from the Gongbei border. Follow the street with the clock tower until it becomes Bar Street.
Your best bet is to hit your bar of choice first and then inquire and explore. The discos tend to be large, intense, and heavy into generic Chinese imitation euro-trance music, and popular with the young and rebellious. Cover charges may or may not apply, drinks are expensive by Chinese standards (generally Â¥30 or more). Be careful with your possessions as these places are notorious for pickpockets.
There are numerous discos in <b>Zhuhai</b> that will allow you to continue your night into the morning. There are several in Gongbei within a short cab ride of either Bar Street or Walking Street:
There are several slightly smaller, dance type clubs located right on <b>Bar Street</b>.
The <b>Xiangzhou</b> and <b>Jida</b> areas also have popular discos.
For singing/drinking in private rooms with your friends, the following places charge per hour for the room and drinks are bought separately in the mini-supermarket within the facilities.
<b>GongBei</b>
<b>Jida</b>
There are a handful of karaoke establishments across the street from the McDonald's as well.

Come to Jinding Barbeque for a unique dining experience and beers aplenty (see Eat Section) and then go to <b>Jinding Karaoke Bar Street</b>, an off-the-beaten-path strip of about 10 truly hole-in-the-wall karaoke bars located northeast of the main street in Jinding. Come here if you want to experience where real salt-of-the-earth working class Chinese people go to get their drinks and howl at high decibel levels into a microphone. It is not easily reached by walking if you do not know where you are going, but it is easy to flag down any of the locals and get a ride on their motorcycle (takes about 3 minutes and costs Â¥5) or take any of the taxi vans parked all around the middle of the main street. Just motion that you want to drink and sing and point in a eastward direction from the center of the main street to convey the message. You will be popular here and may be encouraged to join someone's table and drink gratis as most locals will be surprised a foreigner would come here. Drink plenty of beer or bring earplugs or both to dull the volume of the howling.

<b>The Blarney Stone</b> in the <b>Holiday Inn</b> has quite a number of beers on tap. It is located in Jida. It features live western music performed by Filipino groups, among others, on some nights (usually weekends). The German beers on tap are rather expensive at Y58 (+15%) but Y23 (+15%) for a pint of draught Filipino San Miguel is rather a good deal, especially during happy hour (6-8pm everyday) when it is buy one get one free.  Although the Irish decor is pretty average, it is a large and comfortable venue for those who are looking for a tamer night out. One of the cheaper hotel bars that I have been in and enjoys a reasonable mix of clientÃ¨le for a bar in a western hotel.
<b>Dragon Union Opera House</b>, also in Tangjia, is a large entertainment venue, occasionally featuring live, perhaps tacky, variety shows with acrobats, jugglers, rope climbers and singers, etc. Beer is expensive during shows. There is also a floor dedicated to massages. There are quite a few karaoke rooms available, complete with furniture, beds, food, drink, choice of girls, and optional adult entertainment options to fulfill your every need no matter how unusual. Known even in Hong Kong as a destination for those seeking an 'all inclusive' karaoke experience, it can be as tame or as involved as you want it to be.
Hotels in Zhuhai are reasonably priced. Travelers on tight budgets can opt for budget or midrange hotels. Most people choose to stay in <b>Gongbei</b> due to its proximity to attractions, nightlife, the Macau border, and its variety of conveniently located and reasonable hotels. <b>Jida</b> has primarily upscale hotels that business travelers sometimes opt for, which are usually conveniently located. Some are further away and require taking taxis or the bus. Further out, <b>Xiangzhou</b> also has a variety of options at different price ranges. The Northern districts of <b>Tangjia</b> and <b>Jinding</b> are further removed from the action of Zhuhai and offer very cheap hotels.

Most budget travelers opt for low end hotels, and there are a number of legitimate cheaper hotels in <b>Gongbei</b> with low prices between Â¥160 and Â¥230. Talking your way into <i>Chinese only</i> hotels may land you prices in the Â¥120 to Â¥150 range. Some hotels in <b>Xiangzhou</b> can be had for as little as Â¥100 to Â¥120, and in the Northern districts of <b>Tangjia</b> or <b>Jinding</b> hotels can be had for as low as Â¥80 if you look around. However, for those who truly want rock bottom prices somewhere other than a hotel, there is budget lodging in the form of hostels, and private rooms offered by individuals or families.
On the Walking Street in Gongbei there are at least three massage parlours. If you arrive after 9pm you may pay Â¥60 to Â¥88 (depending on the room type) for two hours traditional Chinese massage and they will let you sleep until mid-day without additional payment. In one establishment you may have the room to yourself. It has television and air-conditioning. In the others you share a room with four other guests.
Touts outside the Xiangzhou bus station offer accommodation, often in private apartments with the family on bunk beds in the living room so the bedrooms can earn money. Â¥50 a night is usual. These are usually clean and have a TV in every room, but up several flights of stairs and with a squat toilet.
There are at least a dozen hotels within short walking distance of the Gongbei border, mostly either cheap or mid-range (Â¥150-400) ones. You can bargain the prices down and normally they have <i>special prices</i>, around half the listed price. On the other hand, it is not uncommon to see a low price on the sign, but find when you go in that only more expensive rooms are available, sometimes this is true, sometimes it is an effort to coax you into a more expensive room. Adventurous single male travelers can scout around for rock bottom prices, and may be able to find a room for as little as Â¥120-130 if they can talk these <i>Chinese only hotels</i> into accepting them, which is not always possible. Single female travelers, those with young families, or those fearing excessive street noise or noise from other guests should have no trouble landing a room for Â¥175-275 (with an elevator, bellhop, restaurant etc), whic anyone would feel more than comfortable staying in. Most of the hotels located around the border fall into this category. The available options are plentiful so looking around for a hotel that suits you may be the best plan.
Most higher end hotels are located in Jida or Gongbei. Gongbei situated hotels are more convenient for accessing the Macau border crossing, colorful nightlife and walking around and exploring. Jida locations vary, depending on the address of the hotel as some are essentially in Gongbei, while others are well north of that and are a taxi ride from the heart of the action.
