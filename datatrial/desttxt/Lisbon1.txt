The capital of Portugal, <b>Lisbon</b> (<a href="/en/Portuguese" title="Portuguese" class="mw-redirect">Portuguese</a>: <i>Lisboa</i>) has experienced a renaissance in recent years, with a contemporary culture that is alive and thriving and making its mark in today's Europe. Perched on the edge of the Atlantic Ocean, Lisbon is one of the rare Western European cities that face the ocean and uses water as an element that defines the city. Lisbon enchants travelers with its white bleached limestone buildings, intimate alleyways, and an easy going charm that makes it a popular year round destination.
Like <a href="/en/%C4%B0stanbul" title="Ä°stanbul" class="mw-redirect">Ä°stanbul</a>, <a href="/en/Amman" title="Amman">Amman</a>, <a href="/en/Rome" title="Rome">Rome</a>, <a href="/en/San_Francisco" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a> and <a href="/en/Bergen" title="Bergen">Bergen</a>, Lisbon is built on seven hills.
The sparkling new <b>Lisboa Ask Me Centre</b> (PÃ§. do ComÃ©rcio, Tel. +351 (21) 031-2815, open 9AM - 8PM daily) will help you find accommodation and the staff are happy to dispense advice, maps and brochures. Smaller <b>Ask Me Lisboa kiosks</b> are dotted about the Rossio district and airport and their multilingual staff also have maps and brochures.
The <b>Lisboa Card</b>, which can be purchased from tourist information outlets, offers free use of all public transport in the city and free or reduced price tickets to many museums, galleries and tourist attractions. They can be purchased in 24 hour adult â¬17, 48 hour â¬27 and 72 hour â¬33  denominations.  They are not very good value unless you plan to visit a lot of museums. Especially so if you are a holder of a student identification card (international or national) since the student discounts to these attractions are often the same as for the <b>Lisboa Card</b>.
<br />
Lisbon enjoys a warm climate, with mild winters and very warm summers.  Strongly influenced by the Gulf Stream it is one of the mildest climates in Europe. Among all the metropolises in Europe, here are the warmest winters on the continent, with average temperatures above 15.2 Â°C (59.4 Â°F) during the day and 8.9 Â°C (48.0 Â°F) at night in the period from December to February. Snow and frost are very rare. The typical summer's season lasts about 6 months, from May to October, with an average temperature of 25 Â°C (77 Â°F) during the day and 16.2 Â°C (61.2 Â°F) at night, although also in November, March and April sometimes there are temperature above 20 Â°C (68.0 Â°F) with an average temperature of 18.5 Â°C (65 Â°F) during the day and 11.2 Â°C (52.2 Â°F) at night. Rain occurs mainly in winter, the summer is very dry.
Lisbon is very close to the ocean and that brings windy and fast-changing weather, so you'd better bring a an extra pair of underwear or an umbrella with you, at least in winter, spring and autumn.
The city stretches along the northern bank of the river Tejo as it flows into the Atlantic Ocean. As the terrain rises north away from the water, steep streets and stairways form the old tangled neighborhoods or give way to green parks in the western suburbs.
On downtown, the vast PraÃ§a do ComÃ©rcio, facing the river at the base of the pedestrianized grid of Baixa (lower town), occupies a central position. Further northwest from Baixa stretches Lisbon's "Main Street", Avenida da Liberdade, a broad boulevard resplendent in leafy trees, chic hotels and upscale shops, terminating at the circular PraÃ§a de Marques de Pombal. To the east are old neighborhoods of Mouraria and Alfama, both relatively spared during the Great Earthquake (as they are on a firmer rock) and therefore both retaining the charm of the winding alleys and <i>azulejo</i>-covered crumbling walls (further north lie relatively boring residential quarters). To the west the hill rises steeply into Bairro Alto (upper town; prepare to trek up, or take one of the <i>elevadores</i>, or funiculars); still further west are rapidly gentrifying former docks of Alcantara, dominated on the western end by the supports of the gigantic new bridge over the river, and the suburbs of Santo Amaro and BelÃ©m.
Portugal's largest international airport is the <b>Aeroporto da Portela</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.lisbon-airport.com">[1]</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IATA" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:IATA">IATA</a>: <b>LIS</b>). It is located between Loures and Lisboa. <i>Alameda das Comunidades Portuguesas</i>, Tel: +350 (21) 841-3000, Fax: +351 (21) 841-3675, <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.ana-aeroportos.pt">[2]</a>
It is the main air hub for TAP Portugal <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.flytap.com">[3]</a>, a Star Alliance <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.staralliance.com">[4]</a> member airline that covers an extensive network throughout Europe, Africa (Morroco, Algeria, Senegal, Guine Bissau, Malawi, Mozambique, South Africa, Angola, Cape Verde, S. Tome e Principe) and the Americas (US, Venezuela and Brazil). SATA (Air A&#231;ores) <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.sata.pt">[5]</a> provides regular service to eastern North America (Boston, Montreal and Toronto).
There are also several other airlines flying into Lisbon, such as United Airlines, US Airways, Emirates, Easyjet, British Airways, Brussels Airlines, Aigle Azur, Air Berlin, Air France, Air Transat, German Wings, TAAG Angolan Airways, STP Airways, Swiss, Transavia, Turkish Airlines, Lufthansa, Finnair, Iberia, Vueling and KLM, amongst others.
In general, if you are arriving by plane in Lisbon and it is still day time, it is almost always better to use public transport - buses or the metro system - to your hotel or final destination. The airport information desk at Lisbon airport can provide you with all the required information. Taxi drivers at the taxi stand at Lisbon are infamous for their dishonesty and unreliability and if they can rip you off, they will. If you do not speak Portuguese or if you don't know the shortest way to your destination, avoid using a taxi unless there is no other option. If your final destination is less than 1 mile from the airport, taxi drivers will refuse to take you although they are not allowed to refuse destinations. If you insist on taking the taxi, the driver will most likely abuse you verbally and try to rip you off. If you are not carrying too much luggage and it is not late in the night, you are better off simply getting a bus or the metro to city center.
There are two main stations, <b>Santa ApolÃ³nia</b> in the city centre and the <b>Gare do Oriente</b>, a bit further out and used by the high-speed trains. However, if you are entering Lisbon from the south, you may want to get off at the smaller stations of Entrecampos or Sete Rios. Their metro stations are a few stops closer to the central and old town. Also, local trains connecting with the resort <a href="/en/Cascais" title="Cascais">Cascais</a> on the Estoril coast use Cais do SodrÃ© station. Train tickets may be booked directly with the train company, <b>Comboios de Portugal</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.cp.pt">[7]</a>.
Two international services are avalible, the overnight <i>Sud Express</i> leaves <a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Irun&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Irun (page does not exist)">Irun</a> on the border between Spain and France every day at 18:20 hours.  There is no physical connection with the TGV train from <a href="/en/Paris" title="Paris">Paris</a> which only goes to Hendaya at the French border. The train calls at  Oriente station 07:22AM the next morning before arriving in ApolÃ³nia just ten minutes later. There is also a daily sleeper train from <a href="/en/Madrid" title="Madrid">Madrid</a> named <i>Lusitania</i> leaving Chamartin station at 10:25PM, arriving early next morning 7:30AM in Oriente and a few minutes later at ApolÃ³nia. Prices starts at â¬90 for a single-journey in Turista-class.
The domestic high-speed line <b>Alfa Pendular</b> connects <a href="/en/Braga" title="Braga">Braga</a>, <a href="/en/Porto" title="Porto">Porto</a> and <a href="/en/Coimbra" title="Coimbra">Coimbra</a> with Lisbon from the north and <a href="/en/Faro" title="Faro">Faro</a> from the south. Prices between the major cities starts at â¬40 in second class. All trains call at Oriente, only some in Apolonia.
Lisbon can be accessed from six main highways. Coming from the south (A2) or east (A6 - the main route from Madrid), there are the two bridges:
<b>From/to south:</b> The A2 goes all the way to the <i>25 de Abril</i> bridge, which usually has lots of traffic getting into Lisbon, especially on weekday mornings. This is the best option if you want to go to the center of Lisbon or to the west (A5 - <a href="/en/Estoril" title="Estoril">Estoril</a>, <a href="/en/Cascais" title="Cascais">Cascais</a>, <a href="/en/Sintra" title="Sintra">Sintra</a>).
<b>To north / to east:</b> If you branch from the A2 into the A12, you'll get to the <i>Vasco da Gama</i> bridge, the longest bridge in Europe, it usually has less traffic than the older 25 de Abril bridge (but a more expensive toll). This is the best option to go to the eastern/northern section of Lisbon (to the airport and to the Parque das NaÃ§Ãµes - the former Expo 98 site), and also to take the A1 or A8 going north.
<b>From/to north and the airport:</b> Coming from the north, there is the A1, that connects Lisbon to <a href="/en/Santar%C3%A9m" title="SantarÃ©m">SantarÃ©m</a>, <a href="/en/F%C3%A1tima" title="FÃ¡tima">FÃ¡tima</a>, <a href="/en/Leiria" title="Leiria">Leiria</a>, <a href="/en/Coimbra" title="Coimbra">Coimbra</a>, <a href="/en/Aveiro" title="Aveiro">Aveiro</a>, <a href="/en/Porto" title="Porto">Porto</a>.  The A1 ends near the airport. There's also the A8, which goes to Torres Vedras, Caldas da Rainha, AlcobaÃ§a, Leiria.
<b>From the west</b>, there is the A5, which connects to <a href="/en/Estoril" title="Estoril">Estoril</a>, <a href="/en/Cascais" title="Cascais">Cascais</a>, and the IC19 that crosses all the suburbs and ends near Sintra.
Lisbon has three ring roads: The 2Âª circular, which connects the A1 to the IC19; the CRIL IC17 (still incomplete), which connects the Vasco da Gama bridge with the A1 and A8; and the CREL A9, which connects the A1 with the A8, IC19, A5, and goes all the way to the Estoril coast.
All nearby cities and most major cities in Portugal have direct buses to Lisbon. The main bus terminal is at Sete Rios (metro: Jardim ZoolÃ³gico).
The main operator for long-course buses is Rede Nacional de Expressos (<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.rede-expressos.pt/default.aspx">http://www.rede-expressos.pt/default.aspx</a>)
You can get a boat to Lisbon from the following stations: Barreiro; Trafaria; Montijo; and Cacilhas. It's an excellent sightseeing opportunity crossing the river Tagus to Lisbon.
Many cruise ships dock at several places along the river on the Lisbon side, with variably good access to public transport throughout the city.  Many lines offer shuttles to key points nearby.
<b>From airport:</b> Due to the relative proximity of Lisbon's airport to the city center, it is quite easy to cycle from the airport to the center, and could be recommended if you arrive for a cycling trip.
After leaving the airport and negotiating a roundabout, merge onto the long and straight dual-carriageway Av. Almirante Gago Coutinho (you should be able just to follow the "Centro" ("Downtown") signs.) After merging, the route to Baixa is simple and straight. This street later turns into Av. Almirante Reis, and then Rua de Palma, at the end of which you will be right in Baixa.
Cycling <b>outside Lisbon</b> can be a challenge, as Lisbon offers far easier cycling than what you may find outside of the city. The further you get from Lisbon however, the easier the cycling gets. You may wish to take advantage of certain regional trains that take bicycles in a separate luggage carriage, allowing you to start your cycling some 50 or 100 kilometers outside of the city.

Lisbon has a very efficient public transport network that covers the entire city in addition to the surrounding areas.
Lisbon's recently refurbished <b>metro</b> system <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.metrolisboa.pt/eng/">[8]</a> is clean, quick, and efficient. While metro announcements are made only in Portuguese, signs and ticketing machines are generally bilingual in Portuguese and English.
The extensive <b>bus</b> and <i>electrico</i> (<b>tram</b>) network is run by Carris <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.carris.pt">[9]</a>.
The best and, in many cases, the sole way to pay for city transport is buying a rechargeable green-colored card <i>7 Colinas</i> (<i>Viva Viagem</i>) <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.metrolisboa.pt/eng/customer-info/viva-viagem-card/">[10]</a>. It is valid for metro, trams (electrico), urban trains, most buses and ferries. The exception is buses run not by Carris&#8212;other bus companies have their own tickets. The card itself can be purchased for â¬0.50 (this price doesn't include any trips&#8212;add as many trips as you want), and remains valid for a year.
The Viva Viagem card can be charged in <i>three different modes</i>:
There are ticketing machines located at the train or metro stations, which also provide instructions in English. You can also buy the ticket from the driver or machines on board (the latter only available in some new trams). Tickets purchased from a driver will not include a Viva Viagem card, and will cost more (â¬1.80 for bus and â¬2.85 for trams instead of â¬1.25 if you use the rechargeable card), so it makes more sense to buy the ticket before starting the trip.
When using suburban trains, your tickets are charged onto the same kind of <i>Viva Viagem</i> cards.  You cannot have more than one kind of ticket on one card, however, so you will probably need at least two of them, one for <i>zapping</i> (regular bus and metro use), one for suburban travel. The TransTejo (TT) ferries can make you buy yet another "Via Viagem" card with white stripe in the bottom, claiming that CP or Carris "Via Viagem" cards are not valid for them.
If you plan to be in Lisbon for an extended time (1 week and more), you can purchase an <b>unlimited pass</b> that covers buses, metro, and funiculars at the Carris station in Santo Amaro, or at the Metro stations Alameda, Marques do Pombal and Campo Grande. It's â¬12 for the Lisboa Viva card, plus â¬29 for a one-month unlimited pass. Bring a photo ID (passport) and cash.

Cycling <b>within the city</b> is now much easier because of the work the municipality has been putting in with bike lanes, slowing car traffic, changing car traffic patterns and adding speed bumps etc but of course parts of the town will always be part of the surprisingly hilly outlet of Lisbon. If you plan to cycle these note that some of these streets do have tram lines, potholes and absent of designated bicycle lanes, so <b>visitors wishing to venture into city traffic by bicycle should be used to urban riding</b>.  Riding on the sidewalk is not recommended. It is advisable to get advice at local bikeshops.
Although better than in recent years there are still bike lanes in town the newest, nice and safe stretches from Baixa to Belem along the beautiful river Tejo water front aptly known as the <b>Poetry Bike Lane</b>
These days car drivers are often weekend cyclists and way more careful with cyclists, more than ever before. 
Good spots for anyone to cycle safe are along the flat riverfront area streching from Parque das Nacoes, to the central area of Cais Sodre, where you can rent bikes look below for bike iberia, and particularly from here to Belem. 
<b>Must do for all travelers or cycling enthusiasts:</b> A scenic and safe bike ride on bike lane from Baixa along waterfront to the historical area of Descobertas-Belem-JerÃ³nimos.
Just outside of Lisbon - you can travel with a bike on trains or ferries - along the coast from Estoril towards the beautiful beach of Guincho, reach <a href="/en/Sintra" title="Sintra">Sintra</a>, <a href="/en/Cascais" title="Cascais">Cascais</a> or <a href="/en/Costa_da_Caparica" title="Costa da Caparica">Costa da Caparica</a>. Although there are some bikes for fre use in Cascais they often in poor condition and are limited offer. If traveling from Lisbon (and back) you should consider renting a bike before going as there are no restrictions, nor additional charges, on traveling with bicycles on commuting trains.
If you take a bicycle in public transportation beware of the following:
<b>Bike shops</b> in Lisbon town center are rare. You can find a SportZone near Rossio or in major shopping malls. Ask there for specialist shops, shop assistants are usually very helpful.
For guided bike the sights in Lisbon, Sintra, Arrabida or Cascais, and bike rentals, you can always check out <b>Bike Iberia</b> (Phone: +351 96 963 0369, <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://bikeiberia.com/">[11]</a>) located in Baixa-downtown, next to Cais Sodre and the Praca Comercio square; they are professional, friendly and very helpful on providing Lisbon Bike Tours, bike rentals with delivery to your hotel doorstep, touring equipment, mountain biking gear, very family friendly and native insider's knowledge.
Riding a Scooter bike is always a great and affordable way to get around Lisbon, one of the "must do" things. you may also venture into beaches, riding around Caparica, Cascais, Sintra or Cabo da Roca. Also the only way to cross over the bridges in Lisbon on two wheels.
Quality Scooters are available for renting at affordable prices (you need to be at least 18, have your Passport and Valid Driving License). Riding around is generally safe, relaxed and lots of fun!
Companies operating in Lisbon include Scooter Lisbon (Phone: +351 96 963 0369), <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://scooterlisbon.com/">[12]</a>) located in Lisbon Downtown right off the train station of Cais Sodre (end of the line from Cascais train station) on Largo Corpo Santo, 5. They are open Monday to Sunday from 9:30am offering quality 125CC vehicles with automatic transmission. Check with them for Scooter Guided Tours or Rentals from only a few hours to multi day rentals.
<br />
Think twice before using a car in the city unless you are prepared to spend hours in traffic jams and looking for parking space. The busy traffic and narrow streets with blind corners can be overwhelming to tourists. Also, due to lack of space and overcrowding, parking is difficult and annoying, as well as potentially dangerous - check the "Stay Safe" section below, regarding potential problems with criminals and homeless people who stand near parking spaces to "help" you park your car and then attempt to extort money from you.
If your accommodation is in the center of the city, <b>walking</b> is a great alternative. Many of the attractions of the city, such as the Castelo and the Alfama and Bairro Alto districts, are within easy walking distance of the Baixa.
If you become lost or cannot find the location you are looking for, try to locate the nearest Carris bus or tram stop. Most of these stops (not all) have a very good map of the city with your current location clearly marked on the map. All the prominent tourist sites in Lisbon are also shown along with an index at the bottom of the map. A quick consultation with one of these Carris maps should point you back in the right direction.
You may also use the <a href="#Specialty_transport"><b>funiculars</b> and <b>elevadores</b> (Santa Justa's)</a>. Day passes for public transportation are also valid for those.
Ferries connect Lisbon to the suburbs across the Tejo river in the south.  Taking a ferry to Cacilhas is a good opportunity to see Lisbon from the water.  A ferry is paid for just like a metro trip; you can even use your <i>zapping</i> (using this system will give you a 0.05â¬ to 0.10â¬ discount on the single ticket) Viva viagem card.
The ferry boat takes you to <a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Cacilhas&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Cacilhas (page does not exist)">Cacilhas</a> (the journey takes 10 minutes) or <a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Trafaria&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Trafaria (page does not exist)">Trafaria</a> (<a href="/en/Almada" title="Almada">Almada</a>) (1.15â¬), <a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Seixal&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Seixal (page does not exist)">Seixal</a> (2.30â¬), <a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Montijo&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Montijo (page does not exist)">Montijo</a> (2.6â¬) or <a href="/en/Barreiro" title="Barreiro">Barreiro</a> (this journey takes half an hour) (2.25â¬).

As with the rest of Portugal, <a href="/en/Portuguese_phrasebook" title="Portuguese phrasebook">Portuguese</a> is the main language in Lisbon. However, most younger people know enough English for basic communication, and it is possible to get by speaking only English. <a href="/en/Spanish_phrasebook" title="Spanish phrasebook">Spanish</a> is widely understood, though few are fluent in it, and many locals will respond more readily to English than to Spanish. Nevertheless, any attempt to speak Portuguese is always appreciated, and even simple things like basic greetings will often draw smiles and encouragement from locals.
<b>Funiculars</b>
<br />
<br />
This monument-packed neighborhood is a must-see place.
Take bus 28 to the west (Restelo direction), which follows the coast line and provides an express service with few stops.
Train Cascais suburban train (line "Cascais todos" or "Oeiras"; the express trains don't stop in BelÃ©m) to BelÃ©m and walk to the attractions.
Tram 15 to the west (AlgÃ©s direction), which follows the Junqueira residencial line. Check the route map inside the tram: it helps to find a right station for most famous of BelÃ©m attractions.  
The extensive bus network also serves BelÃ©m from various departure points around the city and can be less busy than the tram.
The main monuments are well separated from each other and there is a road/rail highway between them that can only be crossed at a couple of places. In addition it is mostly open and unshaded, so be prepared for a lot of walking in the hot sun.
The neighbourhood features:
A stroll around its many gardens enjoying the river's bright blue is also a must.
There is a splendid view of the city from the castle.
Members of the EU can work in Lisbon (and the whole of Portugal) without a work visa. Citizens of non-EU countries <b>must obtain a work visa</b>.
Shops are open a little later than other places in Europe, usually around 9:30AM-10PM, and the lunch breaks can be quite long, usually from 1PM to 3PM.
You can buy a <b>Lisbon Shopping Card</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.askmelisboa.com/en/content/lisboa-shopping-card-0">[56]</a>, which gives you 5% to 20% discounts at about 200 major stores in Baixa, Chiado and Av. Liberdade for a period of 24 hours (card costs EUR3.70) or 72 hours (card costs EUR5.70).
While most stores are closed on Sundays, many malls are open 7 days a week. They usually open around 9:30AM and close by 11PM or midnight, although the film theaters within them usually run a late session starting after midnight.
<br />
<br />
Portuguese dining rituals tend to follow the Mediterranean siesta body clock.
Most restaurants are very small, family run and generally cheap. Some of them have a sheet on the door with the "pratos do dia" (dishes of the day) written on it. These dishes are usually cheaper and fresher than the rest of menu there, and unless you're looking for something specific, they're the right choice.
During the dinner the waiter will probably bring you some unrequested starter dishes (called <i>couvert</i>): as those are not free, feel free not to touch them and they will not be charged on your bill (but check it!).
Never ask a taxi driver about what restaurant you should go, they will take you to an expensive tourist-oriented restaurant, where they will receive a comission.
For Portuguese traditional cuisine at its finest, head to the area of <b>Chiado</b>.
Tourist traps with laminated menus and meal deals are mostly concentrated in the <b>Baixa</b> area.
It has an exception, however: <b>Rua das Portas de Santo AntÃ£o</b> (north-east from Praca dos Restauradores, parallel to it)--it's the seafood strip, and home to the best greasy spit-roasted chicken this side of Louisiana at the <i>Bonjardim</i> restaurant (Santo AntÃ£o, 11), appropriately nicknamed <i>Rei dos Frangos</i>.
For a familiar taste at one of the many chain eateries, head to <b>Doca de Santo Amaro</b> (train/tram 15 station Alcantara-Mar) and <b>Parque das NaÃ§Ãµes</b> (metro Oriental).
All the culinary and clubbing kudos is  right now concentrated in <b>Doca de Jardim de Tabaco</b> (piece of river waterfront right under Castelo de Sao Jorge).
Quality dishes for a high price are in well-to-do <b>Lapa</b>.
Tour groups primarily feel at home in <b>Alfama</b>.
Traditional Portugese restaurants are in <b>Bairro Alto</b>, scattered abundantly through its quirky narrow streets.
<br />
Make sure that you dine at a restaurant that plays traditional <i>fado</i> music. Beware that you'll pay more than in normal restaurants, and the food and drink quality may not be up to the price, you're paying for the music experience.
Try the magnificent <b>pastÃ©is de nata</b> at any <i>pastelaria</i>; or better yet, visit the <b>Antiga Confeitaria de BelÃ©m</b> (Casa Pasteis De Belem) <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.pasteisdebelem.pt/">[65]</a> (Rua de belem 84; +351 21 363 74 23; take <i>elÃ©ctrico</i> #15 from PraÃ§a do ComÃ©rcio, or the Cascais suburban train line from Cais do SodrÃ© station, to BelÃ©m stop). They are served right out of the oven there, with the side of confectioner's sugar and cinnamon; as you navigate through the <i>azulejo</i>-decorated labyrinthine passages of the expansive shop, stop to look at the workers behind glass panels turning the endless stream of these delicacies, just baked, each in its own little ramekin, over onto the waiting trays. These are absolutely a must eat and you can't possibly regret it.
You will find traditional meals served in small coffeeshops/restaurants, especially in the old parts of town. Some will be better than others, just check if there are a lot of locals eating there! They will be very cheap (as low as â¬5 for a full meal) and home-style cooking. The owners probably wont speak english and the menu will probably be in portuguese only!
Grocery stores are closed on Sundays after 1PM, except (a) those smaller than 2000m2 or (b) from November 1st to December 31st.

<br />
Lisbon is known for its lively nightlife. For going out, stroll around the old neighborhood of <b>Bairro Alto</b> ('high neighborhood') for an after-dinner <i>caipirinha</i> or <i>ginjinha</i> and people-watching. Its small streets, full of people, are packed with a high variety of bars. On weeknights bars close at 2 am, weekends at 3 am. The party continues in a night-club after that. Just follow the hordes of people down the hill.
AlcÃ¢ntara, Santos, Parque das NaÃ§Ãµes, and the castle area are all neighborhoods with a thriving nightlife. The whole area near the river/Atlantic, known as the <i>docas</i>, is a huge hub for nightlife, as Lisbon has never lost its ties to the sea.
<b>Choosing location:</b> If you are in Lisbon for sightseeing (especially for your first visit), the best location is along the route of tram #28 (see official map of the route <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.carris.pt/en/interactive-map/e028_all">[87]</a>). This especially works if you are with a baby stroller, as it will save from huge part of hill-climbing.
<b>Finding accommodation when you arrive:</b> Finding a decent sleeping place in the centre should not be a big problem. There is a tourist service centre in the airport, where the nice ladies will book a room for you. Expect to pay between â¬45 and â¬60 for a double room.

Lisbon is generally safe but use common sense precautions, especially at train stations and on public transport.
Some areas are best avoided late at night because of the risk of mugging: Bairro Alto, the alleys, Intendente, Cais do Sodre. Some night clubs in Lisboa have a poor reputation.
According to Eurostat <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page?_pageid=1073,46587259&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL&amp;p_product_code=KS-SF-08-019">[122]</a>, the overall crime rate and in particular <b>robberies</b> are on the rise in Portugal, a possible effect of the current (since 2011) economic crisis and unemployment rate. 
Some areas on the outskirts of Lisbon are becoming more dangerous, but it is unlikely the average tourist will visit these areas. The most common crime against tourists is <b>pickpocketing and theft from rental cars or on public transport</b>. The metro carriages can become crowded and opportune for pickpockets but simple precautions are enough to maintain your safety while travelling on them.
Violent and/or drug related crimes are known to take place in areas such as <i>Bairro Alto</i> and <i>Santos</i>, especially at night. Chances are you'll be approached at least a few times by certain types offering 'hash' or 'chocolate', especially in the downtown area on and around Rua Augusta, or near the Chiado Plaza. If you are of fair complexion or obviously a tourist you are more likely to be approached (young tourists out for drinks are also very likely be approached). These approaches are usually done by drug dealers and scammers and may degenerate into <i>mugging</i>.
Due to soaring house prices, the "Baixa" area (encompassing Rua Augusta, Terreiro do PaÃ§o, etc.) has become depopulated - as soon as the shops and offices close at night, the area becomes fair ground for muggers, caution is needed in back streets, and walking alone is not advised unless you know the area well. The Intendente area is well known for prostitution and drug trafficking. Martim Moniz is also notorious: at night time, the area occupied by shifty crowds that more often than not will cause some trouble. During the day, however, the Martim Moniz plaza is quite safe and pleasant.
<b>ATM / bank machine muggings</b> are commonplace in the city center. Groups of adolescents occasionally stay close to the ATM / "multibanco" and wait until you have entered your PIN. They then force you away from the machine and withdraw the maximum amount (â¬200 maximum per withdrawal; however, two withdrawals of â¬200 per day per bank card are allowed). Try to withdraw money earlier in the day and try to avoid withdrawing money in some of the train stations late at night, especially Cais do SodrÃ©.
<b>Car jacking</b> is also on the rise, usually targeting luxury/top brand vehicles or unescorted female drivers. Always make sure your car doors are locked even during daytime.
Criminals in Lisbon are witty and continuously come up with new <b>scams</b>. Examples include: 
- someone approaches you for no apparent reason and distracts you with conversation or begging, while someone else pickpockets you; 
- someone pretending they need to "borrow" money from you, promising to pay you back in a few hours; 
- another well known scam involves one person offering you drugs, while a second person will suddenly approach you pretending to be a police officer, and asking you to pay a "fine" if you want to avoid "jail".
A firm 'no thank-you' or "nÃ£o, obrigado", if you're a male; "nÃ£o, obrigada", if you're female should be enough to deter them. Another possible option is simply walking away and avoiding any interaction from the first moment.
Finally, when driving, be on the lookout for one of Lisbon's greatest plagues: <b>"arrumadores"</b> - "ushers" or <b>illegal parking "assistants"</b>. These are drug addicts, petty thieves or simply homeless people who stand near vacant car parking spaces and "help" you to park your car even though no help is obviously needed. As soon as you step out of the vehicle, the "arrumador" will try to extort money from you as payment for the so-called "service", through begging at best or physical abuse in the worst situations (rare). They might also pretend to be "official" parking space "guards" or "security" and promise to keep an eye on your car - naturally, they will disappear as soon as you give them money. 
If you are not in a isolated area (i.e. other people / witnesses are around) and decide not to give them money at all you may simply ignore them and walk away after parking your car - should you do so, however, there is a slight risk of having your car damaged or broken into once you are gone, but most times the "arrumador" will just move on to other targets.
Although "arrumadores" are not usually dangerous, caution is always needed: many have been known to use this scam to attack or rob people (especially when they act in groups), and instances of car jacking have been reported, especially when unescorted female drivers are concerned.
Generally, the best course of action is to park somewhere else (preferably in areas that are not too isolated) or just pay for a place in an official parking lot - a bit more expensive, but hassle-free.
Overall, Lisbon drivers can be described as slightly aggressive and careless, although much less so than drivers in other European capitals, such as <a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Rome,_Paris_or_London&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Rome, Paris or London (page does not exist)">Rome, Paris or London</a>.
Lisbon has no more car accidents than any other capital city in the European Union, just in case always so be careful when crossing the streets. Drivers most likely will respect pedestrian crossings and respect red lights.
Cycling in Lisbon can be fun and pleasant on some of its new bike lanes, and also hill climbing free if you ride along the over 20kms river waterfront. Shall you want some hills to climb the Castle hill climb should be last to attempted. Start by riding up hill on pleasant Monsanto Forest Park and west part of the city. Sintra, Cascais and Arrabida are all great and normally safe place where local cyclists are are often out riding.
Driving can be tricky without a GPS system or map, as there is poor signalling in the streets.
Ambulance, fire brigade, police: call <b>112</b>.
Same number is used with both land line and mobile phone. The number works on any mobile phone, whether it is keylocked or not and with or without SIM card.
Private <b>international call centers</b> and <b>public telephone booths</b> are common throughout Lisbon. Be warned, however, public phones can be less generous than slot machines: many times they'll swallow your change and give you no credit. You're better off purchasing a Portugal Telecom pre-paid card you can insert into the phone, or even a discount calling card which connects you via a toll-free number. These can be purchased from street kiosks and convenience stores. Most payphones also allow you to pay by credit card, although support for this feature is somewhat expensive.
<b>Internet cafes</b> are also abundant in the Rossio and Restauradores districts as well as in the Bairro Alto (opening late there). Expect to pay between â¬2 - â¬3 per hour.
