<b>Bucharest</b> (Romanian: <i>BucureÅti</i>) is <a href="/en/Romania" title="Romania">Romania</a>'s capital and largest city, as well as the most important industrial and commercial center of the country. With 2 million inhabitants in the city proper and more than 2.4 million in the urban area, Bucharest is one of the largest cities in Southeastern Europe.
Bucharest is the primary entry point into <a href="/en/Romania" title="Romania">Romania</a>. Bucharest is a booming city with many large infrastructure projects changing the old face of the city.  Known in the past as "The Little Paris," Bucharest has changed a lot lately, and today it has become a very interesting mix of old and new that has little to do with its initial reputation. Finding a 300 year old church, a steel-and-glass office building and Communist-era apartment blocks next to one another is a common sight. Bucharest offers some excellent attractions, and has, in recent years, cultivated a sophisticated, trendy, and modern sensibility that many have come to expect from a <a href="/en/Europe" title="Europe">European</a> capital. Bucharest has been undergoing major construction and modernization works in recent years, such as the Basarab Overpass and the National Arena. Bucharest has benefited from an economic boom along with the EU grants that have helped rebuild neglected parts of the city, such as the historic Lipscani area.
The official language is <a href="/en/Romanian_phrasebook" title="Romanian phrasebook">Romanian</a>, a Romance language which claims to be the closest currently-spoken relative to Ancient Latin, but contains around 20% of loan words from Slavonic languages. Most younger educated people will speak English reasonably well and will likely be proficient in one or more second Romance languages; most educated people born before about 1970 will speak French, Spanish or Italian reasonably well. The Roma people speak their native Romany, as well as Romanian, and sometimes English as well. Beyond that, as in any major city, there will be a smattering of other languages like Chinese, Arabic, Turkish, Hungarian.
Bucharest, like most of Romania, has a temperate-continental climate with hot summers and cold winters. This region of Romania gets all four seasons, although spring is brief and falls mainly in April. The average high daily temperature in summer is about 29ÂºC and in winter about 2ÂºC. It can get really hot and dry during the summer (40ÂºC) and really cold during the winter (-20ÂºC), even though temperatures below -12ÂºC are extremely rare. Best time to visit is April through June, September through October and early December.
Bucharest is in the Eastern European time zone (UTC+2, with a DST of UTC+3 from April to October).
Bucharest has reasonable connections with most European capitals and with the largest cities in Romania, but it can be difficult to find a direct flight to Bucharest from outside of Europe or the Middle East. 
The city is also reached by a large number of low-costs flights, mainly from destinations in <a href="/en/Italy" title="Italy">Italy</a> and <a href="/en/Spain" title="Spain">Spain</a> as well as from some major cities in <a href="/en/Germany" title="Germany">Germany</a>, <a href="/en/France" title="France">France</a>, the <a href="/en/UK" title="UK" class="mw-redirect">UK</a>, <a href="/en/Belgium" title="Belgium">Belgium</a>, <a href="/en/Hungary" title="Hungary">Hungary</a>, <a href="/en/Turkey" title="Turkey">Turkey</a>, <a href="/en/Austria" title="Austria">Austria</a>, <a href="/en/Israel" title="Israel">Israel</a> etc.
All scheduled flights, including those operated by low cost airlines, land at <b>Henri CoandÄ International Airport</b> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IATA" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:IATA">IATA</a>: <b>OTP</b>) <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.bucharestairports.ro/otp/">[1]</a>, located in <a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Otopeni&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Otopeni (page does not exist)">Otopeni</a>, 18 km north of downtown. Henri Coanda airport is often referred to as Otopeni on airline bookings, because of its location . The airport, built in 1968, underwent a massive modernization effort since the late 90's and is set to be further enlarged. It is the main hub for the Romanian flag carrier Tarom <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.tarom.ro/en/">[2]</a>. All concessions inside the airport (shops, cafes, restaurants) are extremely expensive (everything is about twice more expensive than in the city). Avoid exchanging money in the airport, exchange rates are 20-25% worse than what you would find in the city - you are advised to use a credit card at an ATM in the lobby for immediate needs and exchange money downtown. There is a supermarket on the bottom floor (domestic departure) which is a reasonable place to get a snack and/or spend your last few Lei on departure.
The smaller <b>Aurel Vlaicu International Airport</b> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IATA" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:IATA">IATA</a>: <b>BBU</b>) <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.bucharestairports.ro/baneasa/">[3]</a>  was used for commercial flights as early as the 1920s and became a low cost hub in its final years. From March 25th 2012 it is no longer used by passenger airlines. It's located inside the city, in <a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=B%C4%83neasa&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="BÄneasa (page does not exist)">BÄneasa</a>, about 4-6 km to the city center and is set to become a sort of business airport.
There are several options to get from Henri CoandÄ airport to Bucharest:
Express bus <b>783</b> goes from the airport to downtown Bucharest. It runs approximately every 20 minutes, daily, including weekends and holidays (every 40 minutes during the night). Timetable for departures from Henri CoandÄ Airport to the city center is available here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.ratb.ro/docpdf2/783%20AEROPORT%20HENRI%20COANDA.pdf">[4]</a>
Expect the trip with bus 783 to be about 40 minutes long (from PiaÅ£a Unirii to the airport) or even longer during rush hour traffic.
Express bus <b>780</b> links the airport with the main train station, Bucuresti Nord (<i>Gara de Nord</i>). It runs approximately every 40 minutes, daily (including weekends and holidays) from 5.30AM to 11PM.
When taking the 780 bus from Gara de Nord train station to Otopeni airport, note carefully that Gara de Nord is not the end of the bus route, hence, the 780 buses that pass Gara de Nord actually run in two directions. Therefore, at Gara de Nord, to catch the 780 that takes you to Otopeni airport, you need to catch it from the 780 bus-stop that requires crossing a road, i.e. not the 780 bus stop that is directly outside the Nord station. Best to ask locals where the correct bus stop is.
Lowest price option for any of these express buses is 8.6 lei (two rides uploaded on a <i>Multiplu</i> card). 
Cards can only be purchased from the booth in front of either the Arrivals or Departures terminals (respectively on the return trip from ticket booths in stations along their route), they can't be bought from the driver. As of April 2012, there is a ticket machine in front of the Arrivals terminal in service 24 hours a day. Remember to always validate your ticket on boarding the bus, these two bus lines are a prime target for ticket inspectors. The bus is far superior to the train in terms of both time and cost.
The <b>Henri CoandÄ Expres</b> is a combined transfer service by minibus then train to Bucuresti Nord station. It temporarily resumed service in late March 2012.
Tickets can be bought inside the airport at CFR ticket counter; price is 8.1 lei. The trip starts with a transfer by shuttle bus to a small train stop two km away from the airport, followed by a 30 minutes train to Gara de Nord. The shuttle bus transfer IS INCLUDED in the train ticket . The total duration of the trip from airport to the Gara de Nord is approximately 50 minutes. From Gara de Nord you can take public transport (metro and buses) or you can depart by train towards other cities in Romania. The service runs approximately once every hour between 5.15AM and 8.20PM. Timetable for Henri CoandÄ Express is available here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.cfrcalatori.ro/4342">[5]</a>
<br />
Be extremely careful when taking a taxi from the airport to the center, and avoid it if possible. Even official taxi drivers will likely try and extort some extra money out of you if you don't speak the language and seem clueless enough. Taxi scams are one of the most common crimes in Bucharest, so think twice before delivering yourself to the mercy of an unknown driver. Common tricks are:<br />
Should you end up in a situation like this, where the car is driving and the doors are locked and your luggage is in the trunk, then the only way out is to buy your way out through bargaining and lots of yelling back and forth. When lucky you might be able to settle for 120 lei with the driver, but 200 lei or more is not unheard of, especially when you end up having to pay a 'personal escort' of multiple people.
<br />
The safest way to get a taxi with the normal rate (<b>1.39 lei/km</b>) is to go to the Departures entrance and grab a taxi right as it's dropping off someone. Check nonetheless the rate before getting in (it should be written on the taxi's doors) and also check that the meter is turned on. With a normal-rate taxi the ride to the city center should cost about 30-40 lei.
The taxis waiting at Arrivals exit are rip offs, it's best to avoid them: they charge the maximal possible rate (3.5 lei/km), most of them have rigged taximeters and still often refuse to use them, preferring to negotiate even higher prices. A trip to downtown with them costs at least 60-70 lei and may go up to â¬30-40 at night. Remember that for â¬30 you can get anywhere in the country by bus or train, so think twice before you decide to pay a taxi driver the same for a drive of less than 20 km.
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES accept the offer of the people near arrivals terminal who ask you if you want a taxi or offer to carry your luggage.
As of March 2013 there is a Taxi help desk next to the exit after claiming your baggage and passing through customs. The customer service representative usually is fluent in English and French.  You will be provided with a list of the local Taxi companies and their rates. The service desk also allows you to use a telephone for the call to dispatch who will inform you which Taxi will arrive to pick you up. Using this service ride to a downtown hotel can cost as little as 30-35 Lei.
UPD June 2013: It seems that, finally, the taxis at the Arrivals exit are normal 1.39 RON/km ones. You should look to see the 1.39 RON/km fare printed on the taxi door, maybe look for the logo of some big taxi company (like Meridian, Pelicanul, Speed or Taxi 2000) and point to the meter to make sure it's on.
Buses are a good option to get to Bucharest if coming from <a href="/en/Moldova" title="Moldova">Moldova</a>, <a href="/en/Turkey" title="Turkey">Turkey</a>, <a href="/en/Greece" title="Greece">Greece</a> and to some extent <a href="/en/Bulgaria" title="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a>, given the low frequency and speeds of trains between these countries and Romania.
If you're willing to make extremely long bus rides it's also possible to get to Bucharest from a large number of cities in Western and South-Western Europe; these lines are operated by <b>Eurolines</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.eurolines.com/">[6]</a> and their local affiliate <b>Atlassib</b> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://atlassib.ro/csp/webatlass/index.csp">[7]</a>.
The city has several bus terminals: BÄneasa (located in the northern part of town), Obor (east), Filaret (south), Rahova (south-west), Militari (west), GriviÅ£a (north-west) as well as many other smaller stations.
Bucharest also has bus connections to a vast number of cities in Romania.  They're a convenient choice primarily when coming from places from which railways are under repair (like <a href="/en/Constan%C5%A3a" title="ConstanÅ£a">ConstanÅ£a</a> and the Black Sea resorts) or too indirect (like <a href="/en/Sibiu" title="Sibiu">Sibiu</a>).
Timetables for most domestic routes and several international ones are available on <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.autogari.ro/?&amp;lang=UK">[8]</a>.
Bucharest is linked through direct daily trains to most neighboring countriesâ capitals ( <a href="/en/Budapest" title="Budapest">Budapest</a>, <a href="/en/Chi%C5%9Fin%C4%83u" title="ChiÅinÄu">ChiÅinÄu</a>, <a href="/en/Kiev" title="Kiev">Kiev</a>, <a href="/en/Sofia" title="Sofia">Sofia</a>), as well as to <a href="/en/Vienna" title="Vienna">Vienna</a>, <a href="/en/Venice" title="Venice">Venice</a>, <a href="/en/Thessaloniki" title="Thessaloniki">Thessaloniki</a>, <a href="/en/Istanbul" title="Istanbul">Istanbul</a>, <a href="/en/Moscow" title="Moscow">Moscow</a> and of course to main cities in all of Romaniaâs 41 counties.
All international trains and most long distance internal trains arrive at <i>Gara de Nord</i> (Northern) station, located quite near of the city center, to which it is linked by subway and several buses, trolley, and tramway lines. Trains from ChiÅinÄu depart at 16:35 and arrive in Bucharest Gara de Nord at 06:00 the next day, costing 494 Moldovan leu for tickets purchased on the day itself, or 600 leu in advance.
Some trains to and from the <a href="/en/Black_Sea_Coast" title="Black Sea Coast" class="mw-redirect">Black Sea Coast</a> use either <i>Gara de Est-Obor</i> (Eastern) station, or <i>BÄneasa</i> station, as well as the main Gara de Nord station (most of the trains). Currently the route between Bucharest and <a href="/en/Constan%C5%A3a" title="ConstanÅ£a">ConstanÅ£a</a>, the main city in the Black Sea area, has been modernised and the trip duration was lowered to 2:30 hours on direct trains. Following further modernisation expected to finish in 2012 the duration is expected to get to 2:10-2:15 hours.
The other three smaller stations (<i>Basarab</i>, <i>Progresul</i> and <i>Republica</i>) are used exclusively for local and regional trains.
The timetables for domestic routes are available here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.cfrcalatori.ro/">[9]</a>.
Do not use any exchange services around the train station: they offer about 30-50 percent below the actual exchange rate--use an ATM instead or walk a few blocks to get a much better rate, then take the subway system, which is reasonably priced (~1 euro for 2 uses, as of January 2013) and has clearly marked maps and schedules.
Watch out for the shady private taxi services and avoid taking taxis near the stations as they are often rogue operators who may take advantage of less prudent tourists. You should know that near the stations all of them will try to cheat you and you will have to be both vigilant and lucky to avoid being ripped off. Always look to see if the cab driver starts the meter and alert him by saying "aparatul" (<i>ah-pah-RA-tool</i>) while pointing at the meter.  There will be drivers offering rides - be extremely wary. It is recommended to ride only with drivers who use the meter and have the general tariff (currently 1,39 lei/km, January 2013). The tariff is written on the front doors of the car. Never accept bargains and other offers, they are usually more than double than the route is worth.
The cityâs entrances from the north (the E60 road coming from BraÅov), west (the A1 highway from PiteÅti), east (the A2 (Sun) highway from ConstanÅ£a), south (the E20 road from Giurgiu) and the avenues in the city center are very crowded, especially at rush hours. Inside the city there are few parking spaces and some of the secondary streets are in bad condition.
Bucharest has one of the most extensive systems of public transport in Europe, even though it can sometimes be confusing and crowded.
The metro, which has four lines (M1, M2, M3, M4) and covers the city quite extensively, is usually a cheap (4 lei for 2 trips, 15 lei for 10 trips and 60 lei for a monthly pass) and easy way to get around even though there are surprisingly few stops in the city center, since the system was originally built to transport workers and commuters from outlying neighborhoods through the city to peripheral industrial areas. If you're staying outside the city center, or even if you want to travel within it, the Metro can be a very fast and convenient way of traveling to your destination, avoiding the traffic jams and crowds that frequently characterize surface transport.
The network is arguably frequent and fairly comfortable, reliable and easy-to-use. Surprisingly for some, it is by far the safest way to travel through the city. Since 2002, Bucharest Metro has embarked on a comprehensive modernization plan, including the replacement of old train-sets with state-of-the-art Bombardier Transportation trains and the renovation of stations and tracks in collaboration with Alstom.
Line <b>M1</b> starts in the eastern part of the city and then goes through the downtown on a circular route, passing by the main train station <i>Gara de Nord</i> and meeting up with the <b>M2</b> line (which runs north-south) at <i>PiaÅ£a Unirii</i> and <i>PiaÅ£a Victoriei</i> stations. Line <b>M3</b> links the western and eastern parts of the city. The central section on the <b>M3</b> between <i>Eroilor</i> - <i>Nicolae Grigorescu</i> is shared with <b>M1</b> and trains from both lines run in tandem having the terminus displayed at the front of the cab. Line <b>M4</b> is a short shuttle line starting from <i>Gara de Nord 2</i> going to <i>Parc Bazilescu</i> in <i>BucureÅtii Noi</i> neighborhood (as of 2011). Even though <i>Gara de Nord</i> and <i>Gara de Nord 2</i> are in close proximity, transferring between the two is taxed as a separate trip. The only platform to platform link between <b>M4</b> and <b>M1</b> is at <i>Basarab</i> station. <b>M4</b> line is planned to eventually link the city with its airports.
Maps of the subway can be found on the Metrorex official site <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.metrorex.ro">[10]</a>.
Bucharest has a very complex network of buses, trams and trolleybuses which is, at first glance, fairly confusing to the tourist. This is not because of any inconsistencies within the network, but rather due to the intricate web of hundreds of bus, tram and trolleybus routes found in the city. Once you know your way around the network, however, public surface transport can be a very good way of getting around since there is a bus, tram or trolleybus stop virtually <i>everywhere</i> in this city. The vehicles are usually very frequent, although they can also get terribly crowded at peak hours.
Make sure you know the stop you're getting off at - even though in most trolleybuses and in some modern buses and trams, following stops are announced automatically and displayed on a screen inside the vehicle. However, these displays tend to be not very reliable, pointing to either a wrong stop or not working at all. In addition, the older buses (most commonly found outside the core center) do not have any displays or announcements. If you are uncertain if a stop is the one you want, you can always ask your fellow travelers.
The ticketing system uses contact-less smart-cards, called <b>Activ</b> cards <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://card.ratb.ro/">[11]</a>. Once bought (you will need some ID to do that) the cards can be loaded with various ticketing options, including some that allow usage on both the subway and surface networks. To validate the card after entering a vehicle (or subway station) hold it still in front of the validating device (an orange box with a small LCD screen) until you hear a short beep (The LCD display will show "Calatorie Placuta" = Have a nice trip). If you hear a long beep followed by the message "Repetati validarea la acelasi validator" = "Repeat the validation on the same machine" or any other message, please validate the card again. It is very common in this system to give errors very often, so it recommendable to be sure that you have paid for your trip. If you want to be sure that you have paid, press the button 1 and hold the card near the validator, it will mention the amount left and for how many passengers it was validated. To validate it for more than one passanger (this is available only for electronic wallet not for daily/weekly/monthly pass), you have to press the button no. 2 and hold the card near the validator. For any other additional traveler you have to press 2 again and receive the message "Calatorie Placuta" for each passenger. The paper tickets valid for one ride on one route are not any more available (they were removed starting with May 2011). Be warned that you cannot buy tickets/cards in the vehicles and if caught by an inspector (<i>controlor</i>) you could be fined with 50 lei. Some buses still use the old system of paper ticket, essentially a strip of paper that needs to be validated inside the bus. Be sure to validate your ticket, as enforcers can be very strict, even to visitors unfamiliar with the system. A ticket is valid only on the bus/tram/trolley where it was validated. If you change the bus/tram/troley, you have to validate again the card. Also, the ticket is valid only for one trip with the transport vehicle from one end to the other. However, in Bucharest most of the busses and troleys will have one end (usually in dowtown, where is no space for creating proper "end of the line" stops) without any distinct stop, so you will not be aware that you have to validate again, being liable to receive a fine. 
For this reason, is better to buy a daily (8 RON = 1.8 Euro) or weekly pass (17 RON = 4 Euro) for your trips in Bucharest, because the pass will not require any validation. The prices are very small compared with the travel options available (busses, night busses, trams and trolleys), so the pass will help you to have a trip without any headaches.
<br />
Starting with July 2011, the night buses are also available. They will run between 23:00 to 01:00, every 30 minutes, 1:00 to 5:00, every 1 hour and 5:00 to 6:00, every 30 minutes. The lines can be seen here <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.ratb.ro/v_noapte.php">[12]</a> and the map here <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.ratb.ro/maps1/Trasee_noapte.pdf">[13]</a>

Car rental in the Pache Protopopescu Street or Europcar are all at the city and airport. Other local rentals also throughout the city. The average price for a day rental is about â¬20 for the cheapest car. Car Rental companies: <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.auto-rent.ro">Promotor Rent a Car Bucharest</a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.rentngo.ro">RentNGO</a>.
There are a lot of taxi companies in Bucharest and you'll easily find a cab here. But be aware! Don't take any independent cab drivers, but use only the services of big taxi companies. Cars from these companies have the rates displayed on the door. Each door used to contain an initial "sitting" fee (between 1.6 to 3 lei), a per km fee (1.4 to 3.6 lei) and per hour fee. However, taxis now display a single number which is both the initial "sitting fee" and the per km fee. The per hour fee is not listed, but should be around ten times the per km fee. <i>Independent have significantly higher fees (up to ten times the average!)</i> If a taxi does not display these prices on the door it is best not to take it and find another, as you'll probably be charged a rate five to ten times higher than usual. Also, it should be noted that some taxis now have a low "nighttime rate" listed in a large font with an expensive daytime rate listed in a small font. So, read carefully and remember that <i>noapte</i> means night. And you should insist the driver starts the meter, and pay the sum displayed on it. If you are traveling outside the city limits (say to or from the airport) prices per km and per hour are often doubled, or an extra 10-15 lei is added to the fare. Be wary of taking taxis from places where a lot of tourists pass through, especially from Gara de Nord. Many of these taxis may be operated by con men. Tourists being asked to pay large sums to recover their luggage from the trunk or even muggings after taxi rides are not unheard of.
There are also a number of smaller museums, housing private collections, notably the <b>âD. Minovici" Western European Arts Museum</b> located in a beautiful eclectic villa (<i>strada N. Minovici, nr.3</i>) and numerous memorial houses dedicated to various literary, scientifical and political personalities.
There are two free weekly guides published in Bucharest featuring all the events of the week, as well as listing the addresses of most restaurants, clubs, pubs, bars, cinemas etc. in the city. One is <i>Åapte Seri</i> (Seven nights), the other 24-FUN. They have small sections in English available.
Most films are screened in their original language with Romanian subtitles; some animation features and children's movies are dubbed in Romanian.
Major brand-name shops and upscale boutiques are concentrated along the main boulevard from PiaÅ£a RomanÄ to PiaÅ£a Unirii and on the small streets adjacent to this boulevard, but also on Calea Victoriei, on Calea DorobanÅ£ilor (the part between Blvd. Iancu de Hunedoara and PiaÅ£a DorobanÅ£ilor) or on Calea MoÅilor's section between Blvd. Carol I and PiaÅ£a Obor.
In the past years numerous modern shopping centers have sprung up in the city (and even more are in construction), the best known being:
More shopping malls in Bucharest and its surrounding area are being currently constructed or in the planning stages of being constructed
Book stores with a good supply of English language books are difficult to find in Bucharest but there are a few places mainly situated in the center.
Also, the biggest chain of libraries in Romania called "Diverta" has in every location a department with English/German/French books. Now it's down.

Buses are safe, but use your common sense, and put your things in internal pockets, just to be 100% sure. Taking taxis from areas frequented by foreign tourists may also pose a threat as some of these taxis may be operated by con men waiting for an unsuspecting victim. This is especially true for taxis around Gara de Nord where their associates actively try to lure you into such cars. If possible, avoid taking cabs from Gara de Nord unless you are familiar with the taxi operators there.
It is strongly recommended to avoid taking a taxi from Bucharest "Henri Coanda" Airport, especially after dark. Even if the officially rate is 3.5 lei/km (in the city is under 2 lei/km), most of them will try to overcharge you. 
If you really want to take a taxi, go to Departures Terminal and wait for a taxi that comes from the city center. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES accept the offer of the people near arrivals terminal who ask you if you want a taxi or offer to carry your luggage.
One rule of thumb is to go with older taxi drivers, since they will be more cautious and only try to get a bit extra out of you if they scam you, unlike young drivers who will claim a trip costs 3-5 times as much as it should, may claim the meter does not work, and may try intimidation tactics to make you pay.
The safest option to take a cab in Romania if you have a smart phone is to download the "Star Taxi" application. It gives you instant access to reliable taxi companies and it operates by locating your exact position on the map and asking nearby free cabs if they want to take you to your destination. You will receive instant messages from the taxi driver closest to where you are located, giving exact details of the price per km, the company that they are employed at, their full name and picture and also the number of minutes that takes them to get to you. You can accept or decline the driver. After you have accepted you can track your cab on the map and once he/she has arrived you will get a message saying that. You can also chat with the taxi driver or call them directly through the appilcation. Once you are in the car just make sure the meter is on and feel free to enjoy their free wifi until your destination. Only licensed taxis, with regular rates can register their services with this application so no worries about being scammed.
Be very careful of unsolicited offers of help by passersby, even if they have good English. In particular if a stranger offers to accompany you to your hostel or hotel in a taxi to show you the way, decline immediately. They are often working in tandem with unlicensed taxi drivers who will attempt to scam you, drop you at incorrect (and remote) locations while demanding exorbitant payment, or who will simply steal your luggage. A common scam is for a stranger to tell you that a place is not safe, and to direct you to an official "government" or "student" taxi, that is driven by an accomplice. They will then drive you a remote location, and demand high sums of money, possibly threatening you with violence if you don't comply.
Be also careful when boarding or leaving trains. Scamsters have been known to impersonate other passengers, and enter couchettes or sleeping booths on trains while the occupant politely waits outside, and then steal from luggage. When requesting assistance on boarding trains, deal only with the conductor and if anyone asks you for information, demand to see ID.
Although statistically Bucharest is one of the safer capitals in Europe, violence is not an uncommon sight in certain areas, towards locals or towards foreign looking people (minorities, out of place individuals, etc.). Nightclubs and bars, where heavy drinking occurs regularly, are especially prone to this, particularly those playing ethnic music. However, just avoiding any conflict, particularly with people who have the air of "owning the place" or a mafioso look would reduce your chances to almost zero.
Bucharest has perhaps the largest population of stray dogs for a city in eastern Europe. Although their numbers are gradually decreasing due to projects by the City Hall, they still remain a threat to safety and, at night, they tend to form packs which greatly increases their danger. Rabies vaccinations are recommended but not required, as there have been no rabies cases in Bucharest since 1979. Most dogs will not give you a problem unless you go out of your way to pester them, but many dogs have been treated poorly. Be extremely wary of them, and do not approach a stray dog if you are alone. It is perhaps best to walk around in a group or walk where you see other people.
Like most other big cities, walking around at night isn't safe in some parts of the city like Pantelimon, Ferentari, Giulesti, and the Gara de Nord area. If you must travel into these neighbourhoods, it's safer to take a taxi.
Gara de Nord is not particularly dangerous to walk in, but avoid suspicious-looking characters, and if you feel that you are being followed, just walk into the station. Gara de Nord and its surroundings are populated by homeless people and children. Be careful, as many street children use an inhalant drug (equivalent to huffing paint) and may be dangerous. As heartbreaking as this problem is, it's best to avoid any contact. If you do wish to give them something, buy food for them, don't give them money. Ferentari is a gypsy enclave in Bucharest and, while not as dangerous as it used to be, it's not advisable to walk there at night. In fact it is better to avoid it completely. For the traveler, there is nothing of interest there so you should have no reason to go there to begin with.
The unofficial red light district is MÄtÄsari, which is also a popular place for clubbers and pubs; you can walk there without any worries because it's always crowded and lively, but avoid talking to strangers in that particular area, especially Gypsies. As of 2009 there have been a lot of crackdowns on pimps and prostitutes in the Matasari area, so be careful or you might wind up spending a night in jail and with a hefty fine if caught soliciting.
In the event that you do get caught in a police raid, do not attempt to bribe your way out of it with so many of them around as you might get into serious trouble. Police are more inclined to take bribes from locals than from foreigners so do not contribute to this phenomenon that has been plaguing this country for so many years. Police corruption has been vigorously fought in the past years, and it is not as generalized as it used to be in the 1990s. It's always better to walk on boulevards and avoid alleys and backstreets.
The crime rate is low, but a traveler must always be cautious. Violent attacks are very low, but if attacked just yell, "Ajutor!". It is very difficult for anyone to get away with violent crime because as everything is packed so closely together, any loud noise will attract attention. This is truly a city that doesn't sleep. You'll find people out and around at all hours in most parts of the city. Police men are pretty friendly and the younger ones speak English, so you can ask directions. In the event that you do need to report a crime to the police, do not hesitate and proceed to the nearest police station. They will often help you to the best of their ability.
One must be incredibly careful as a pedestrian in Bucharest. Drivers are inconsiderate and often do not obey traffic signals. NEVER assume a car will stop for you at a red light--be vigilant at all times. This is definitely the <b>biggest</b> hazard in Bucharest, not so much in the daytime, when crowded streets make it impossible to drive cars at high speeds, but, at night, the streets clear out, a lot of illegal races taking place with reckless driving on main boulevards.
Asian tourists are more likely to be seen as an easy mark for dishonest taxi drivers and other criminals. It does not make a difference if you are Asian-American or are from Asia. Some young Asian women may also get a lot of perverted looks from men all around the city - be prepared to be stared at especially if you are traveling alone, though some men will stare no matter what.
Those with allergies may find Bucharest annoying in that it is both hot and very dusty in the summer, with temperatures easily exceeding 30 C in July and August, so bring whatever you might need to stay comfortable. Please note that during the summer, sun strokes and heat strokes can be very dangerous.
Pharmacies are usually open between 9 AM and 6 PM, but some will stay open through the night. In Romania, there are relatively few over-the-counter drugs available, but pharmacists are allowed to dispense limited quantities of some prescription drugs (such as pain relief medicine) for what they see as immediate needs. Bucharest has 6 designated emergency hospitals and a modern ambulance service, plus a large number of additional public and private hospitals, clinics, and dental practices.
